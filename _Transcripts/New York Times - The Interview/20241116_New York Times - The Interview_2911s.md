Video Description: Dr. Ellen Wiebe has performed hundreds of medical aid in dying (or MAID) procedures and is one of Canada’s most prominent advocates for the practice. David Marchese had questions — medical, legal and philosophical — about when it makes sense for doctors to help people to die, and also about how MAID might shape our thinking on what, exactly, constitutes a good death.

# The Doctor Who Helped Me Understand My Mom’s Choice to Die
**New York Times - The Interview:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. Today's episode is a little different. It's kind of more about a topic than it is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=7.0s)]
*  a specific person. That topic is the controversial subject of medical assistance in dying, also [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=16.44s)]
*  known by the acronym MADE. That's the term for when patients legally receive help from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=22.72s)]
*  medical practitioners with ending their lives. Here in the U.S., MADE is currently legal [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=27.24s)]
*  in 10 states and the District of Columbia. Patients have to be terminally ill in order [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=32.72s)]
*  to be eligible. In Canada, where I'm from, the practice is legal nationwide, and patients [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=37.04s)]
*  can apply for it in cases where they have a, quote, grievous and irremediable medical [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=42.76s)]
*  condition, which does not necessarily mean terminal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=47.36s)]
*  This episode is a little different for this reason too. I have a very personal connection [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=53.28s)]
*  with the topic. Earlier this year, my mom died by MADE. I have to admit I didn't really [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=57.56s)]
*  have many questions about it beyond the basic hows. That is, until a journalist friend of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=63.56s)]
*  mine, somewhat provocatively and also astutely, sent me an article about a MADE provider in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  British Columbia named Ellen Wiebe. Wiebe has performed hundreds of MADE procedures and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=73.8s)]
*  is one of Canada's most prominent advocates for the practice. As I looked more into Dr. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=78.56s)]
*  Wiebe, who is 72, I realized that actually I did have all sorts of unanswered questions, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=83.44s)]
*  medical, ethical, and philosophical, about doctors helping people to die and about how [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=88.92s)]
*  MADE might shape our ideas of what a good death even means. Here's my conversation with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=93.92s)]
*  Dr. Ellen Wiebe. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=100.4s)]
*  Dr. Wiebe, thank you very much for taking the time to do this. I appreciate it. I just [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=103.4s)]
*  want to tell you upfront, my mom died from MADE in June in Ontario, and that's part of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  why I'm talking to you today. And I'm glad that she had MADE and it was the right decision [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  for her. But I just wanted to tell you that so you know where I'm coming from. And also, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=128.68s)]
*  I want to apologize in advance if I get emotional during this conversation. It's probably not [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=134.68s)]
*  what I'm supposed to do, but there's not going to be any way around it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=143.32s)]
*  Exactly. There is no easy way to say goodbye to your mother. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=145.84s)]
*  I assume that plenty of doctors support MADE, but I don't know how many doctors would want [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=152.52s)]
*  to be MADE providers. What distinguishes you from other doctors? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=159.4s)]
*  Well, human rights has been a major focus of my life, and my other practice is abortion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  And again, it has to do with basic human rights, people's rights over their own lives, their [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  own bodies. And I'm comfortable with that. And I feel honored that people trust me to help them [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=179.4s)]
*  through these difficult things that they're going through, and that I can hand them that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=188.2s)]
*  autonomy that they've lost. Do you ever have doubt or skepticism about your own work, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=193.92s)]
*  either on the level of how the system works or on a more personal level, feelings of regret, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  or sadness? Well, I mean, there's the intense grief that we see sometimes, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=209.08s)]
*  but a lot of the deaths that we are dealing with aren't like that. The grief, the tragedy was [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=217.08s)]
*  elsewhere. At that moment, they are celebrating a life. So last night, I was with a family who [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=223.24s)]
*  was celebrating the life of a 92-year-old father who was leaving. And there were tears, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  but there was laughter. And there were pictures of when he was an 18-year-old gorgeous young man. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=238.72s)]
*  And that kind of thing that we've all gone through with saying goodbye to a loved one, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  where there's the good and the bad. And I'm so honored to be a part of these amazing experiences, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  like last night's. You know, as you're deeply aware, there are all sorts of different criticisms and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  skepticisms around medical assistance and dying. There's the slippery slope argument, of course. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=269.84s)]
*  If you allow people to do this, then- Everybody's going to want to die. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=276.0s)]
*  Everyone's going to want to do it. Or it's not so much that everyone's going to want to do it. I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  think the concern is that more people might feel compelled to do it or will do it who otherwise [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=284.96s)]
*  wouldn't choose to die. That's right. So that's the concern. And I was being flippant there, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=291.2s)]
*  basically people want to live unless their life is unbearable. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=299.12s)]
*  Well, so that's one concern. Another concern could be deemed religious to do with the sanctity of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=303.44s)]
*  life and made devalues that. Another concern would be that people might end up choosing it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=309.84s)]
*  for financial reasons or because they're pressured into it. There's a long list of concerns. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=318.08s)]
*  Do any of the arguments against made hold water for you? Do any of them give you pause? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  It is our job as clinicians who assess people for made to determine some of these issues you've [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=332.0s)]
*  just brought up. For example, I met a man in residential hospice and he was late stage, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=340.96s)]
*  confined to bed. He said, the reason I want made is because I don't want to be a burden to my family. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=350.4s)]
*  They keep coming into the hospice and they should be working. I have to deal with that. Sorry, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=357.6s)]
*  that's not a good enough reason. But in fact, of course, he also was very distressed at the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  fact that he had been a person who had taken care of his family, who had taken care of others. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=374.48s)]
*  And now he could lie in bed and have people take care of him and it was unbearable to him [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  that he was in that state and he wasn't getting better. He was just going to do more and more, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=386.08s)]
*  but until he was dead. And so I had to determine that his suffering also included that and not [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  merely doing it to protect his family from having to come to the hospice to see him because they [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=400.64s)]
*  loved him so much and wanted to be there. What determination did you make in that instance? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=407.44s)]
*  Oh, he was most definitely eligible. His family gathered around him and it was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=411.76s)]
*  a very moving, comfortable death for him and his family. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to ask about where the line should be for eligibility. I think it's 2027 in Canada, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=424.56s)]
*  people for psychological reasons will be able to access MADE. And I know in other countries [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=436.56s)]
*  there's been broader discussion about MADE in instances of early dementia. People saying, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  I want to go before the disease gets too far. Or I think it's the Netherlands, they've talked about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=450.24s)]
*  MADE in instances of, they call it completed lives, when an elderly person just has reached [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=457.68s)]
*  a point where they say, I've lived my life. It's not that they're ill or depressed or suffering, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  they just feel like their life is done. And those are all pretty, in a way, different [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=472.08s)]
*  circumstances. And I just want to know where you think, societally, we should say, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=479.28s)]
*  the line is for someone being able to access medical assistance and dying. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=487.2s)]
*  I don't have the answer. Again, I come from human rights. People should have control over [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=493.12s)]
*  their own lives. And they should be able to have help at the end if they so desire. But there's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=499.76s)]
*  the situation of a quadriplegic. Generally, it's young men who do risky things who become [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  quadriplegic. And they are horrified at the idea that they're going to live totally dependent for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=516.56s)]
*  the rest of their lives and want to die early. And then years later, they maybe they've got [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=523.92s)]
*  university degree, career, family, and they love life and feel that it would have been terrible if [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  they had had the choice to die early because they would have taken it. And that's a problem. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=542.96s)]
*  How long should you force somebody to put up with quadriplegia before they can make the decision [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  that that's not acceptable life to them? And there isn't an answer because people should have the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  right to control their lives. Have you ever helped someone with made and then regretted it? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=565.84s)]
*  No. I don't agree with all of my patients' choices. Sometimes I struggle when I see a young, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=572.96s)]
*  beautiful person choosing to leave earlier than they needed to because it's hard, especially on [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=591.84s)]
*  their parents. And I'm a parent of adult children. But I believe so strongly in basic human rights. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=601.76s)]
*  If that person says that they can't live with this condition, then once we've gone through [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=612.96s)]
*  the whole process, I will honor their wishes. Now I want to ask some questions that directly [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=622.0s)]
*  come out of my mom's experience. So just for more context, she had ALS, she was seven years old. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=637.12s)]
*  She was suffering physically and mentally. There's no doubt in my mind that made was the right [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=645.28s)]
*  thing for her. It's what she wanted. My family's all in agreement about that. And yet it raised [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=654.32s)]
*  questions for me. And so this part is just for people who don't know the process. So in Ontario, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=659.84s)]
*  one of the steps is that you have two independent assessments from a doctor or nurse practitioner [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=667.52s)]
*  who help determine whether or not a patient is eligible for MADE. There's a bunch of other steps, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=674.48s)]
*  but this step is the one that I'm thinking about now. So I was at one of those assessments. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=679.84s)]
*  It's sort of a surreal experience to be in the room while your mom is talking with a doctor [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=686.24s)]
*  explaining why she wants to die. It's just a strange thing. But another aspect of it that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=692.96s)]
*  was surreal for me was, so I'm sitting in a room listening to a conversation between my mom and a [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=700.0s)]
*  doctor who's never met my mom, trying to assess my mom's sort of material, physical, and psychological [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=708.64s)]
*  situation. And then we all know that this person is going to give a thumbs up or thumbs down [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=715.6s)]
*  at the end of it. And I don't think anyone was dishonest or negligent or anything like that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=721.04s)]
*  But I still thought, what does this doctor really know about this situation? There's this strange [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=727.52s)]
*  dynamic of my mom wants something from this doctor. The doctor knows that. He's asking questions that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  clearly have, for lack of a better term, correct answers in the situation. Just something about [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=739.6s)]
*  the whole thing seemed both totally insufficient to determine what my mom actually thinks and feels. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=746.0s)]
*  And then also, on some level, just an example of medical hubris. Why would this doctor think [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=752.72s)]
*  she can understand the fullness of the situation based on a one-hour [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=761.2s)]
*  remote call? The whole thing felt a little bit like a charade to me or a game we're all willingly [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=766.0s)]
*  entered in. Why isn't it? Interesting. Okay, so first of all, the clinician who assessed your mother [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=771.84s)]
*  reviewed her medical history. And it was extensive, I'm sure. So there was not only a description of [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  the diagnosis of ALS, but also her deterioration over time and her reaction to that, her reaction [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=795.28s)]
*  to the medications that were given to alleviate her suffering. And so the doctor had a lot more [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=804.48s)]
*  information than what she got from that one hour. And secondly, our job during those assessments is [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=812.48s)]
*  to make sure that the person understands their condition. I mean, remember some of the ALS [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=820.88s)]
*  patients we assess can't talk. And when somebody is non-verbal, it's more of a struggle. But your [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=827.6s)]
*  mother was still verbal, right? Yeah. So being able to understand that she understood her condition, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=834.72s)]
*  that she understood her options, that probably wasn't very difficult for the assessor. And that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=843.2s)]
*  was the basic thing that we want because we have eligibility criteria that we have to go through. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=852.24s)]
*  There's the easy ones, over 18 eligible for Canadian medical insurance. That's an equivalent [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=860.08s)]
*  of residency status. And so those are all the easy ones we check off. And then the more complex [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=867.36s)]
*  ones are capacity to make decisions and the understanding. So yes, that is the main thing [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=874.4s)]
*  that we are assessing is do they understand this decision they're making after we know that they [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=883.92s)]
*  have checked all the other boxes. I have to admit, you know, I was wrestling with what I thought [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=890.32s)]
*  were the epistemological problems of maid assessment, where I was just thinking, how can these people [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=897.2800000000001s)]
*  really know what my mom is thinking? But I guess your point is, it's not their job to know what my [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=903.2800000000001s)]
*  mom is thinking. Your mother had rights. Maid applicants have to be of sound mind. You know, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=912.48s)]
*  you have to determine that they're being rational and logical. And this is something that I [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=924.4s)]
*  struggled with a little bit when it came to my mom's decision to use maid. She was physically [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=931.84s)]
*  suffering, but then was also depressed. And, you know, depression, as I understand it, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=940.48s)]
*  the medical definition is that it's a mood disorder. So how can we say with certainty that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=947.28s)]
*  someone experiencing a disordered mood or disordered state of mind is making a rational choice? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=953.44s)]
*  Exactly. So this is something that we have to work on. In that kind of situation, instead of asking [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=960.4s)]
*  somebody if their mood is low, which hers was, of course, and many of my patients who are dying, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=967.92s)]
*  because they're losing so much. I mean, they're, it's, they, and often like your mother, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=975.12s)]
*  have one loss after another loss after another loss. And that's really depressing. And so, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=980.24s)]
*  how do you figure out whether they have a mood disorder that disorders their thinking so that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=988.72s)]
*  they can't think clearly about making a logical decision? So what I look at in someone like that [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=994.4s)]
*  is when people are clinically depressed, they tend to believe that they are bad people, that the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1001.04s)]
*  world's a bad place, that it's their fault that things are going wrong. And that is disordered [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  thinking that might respond to therapy, even in a dying person who's suffering physically. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  But if a person like your mother says, I'm losing everything, the things that used to give me joy, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1023.68s)]
*  I can't do anymore. What's the point in going on just to get worse and worse? That's pretty [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1033.04s)]
*  logical. She's recognizing the truth of the situation. I'm also curious about the subject of [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1040.48s)]
*  made in grief. My best friend five years ago died from suicide, you know, not medically assisted. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1049.0400000000002s)]
*  And that for me was a real, you know, it was a complete surprise to me, totally out of the blue. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1058.88s)]
*  And it, I'm so sorry. I really felt like a rupture that I still feel like is not [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1064.72s)]
*  closed, you know, five years later. And I think the closest I've gotten is that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1072.4s)]
*  accepted that like, it's just always going to be a bit of a painful question mark there. That's [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1076.64s)]
*  as far as I can take that. But with my mom, I don't have any of those feelings at all, the feelings of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1082.16s)]
*  rupture and emotional discombobulation, you know, and my hunch is that made had a lot to do with [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1092.48s)]
*  that, you know, it was her choice. It was a clear choice. You know, we knew when when she was going [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1101.36s)]
*  to die, we had time to spend just with her. I asked her everything I needed to ask her and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1107.36s)]
*  said everything I needed to say to her. And, you know, I think as a result, I felt prepared for [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  my mom dying. Do you have any sense of the connection between made in grief or? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1121.84s)]
*  Yes, we, we need to know more. But there are clear differences between grieving after made [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1128.64s)]
*  versus grieving from sudden deaths like your friend or expected but natural deaths. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1136.08s)]
*  And they have to do with the planning. So for a lot of people, the planning for an assisted death [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1144.16s)]
*  allows for people to do exactly what you said, say the things that need to be said, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1152.48s)]
*  ask the questions that needed to be asked. And people say that it makes it easier. But the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1158.56s)]
*  harder thing for some people is that this person left earlier than they needed to, they could have [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1165.52s)]
*  gone on longer. And that can feel like abandonment and rejection in a way that is very hard on the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1172.0s)]
*  survivors. In terms of suicide versus made, you described it beautifully. I mean, the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1181.92s)]
*  suddenness of a suicide, the violence, the fact that they have to do it alone [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1189.52s)]
*  and not have anybody with them, that it is unsanctioned, police have to be involved, etc. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1196.72s)]
*  It makes it all more difficult on the survivors. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  I just want to pull back again for a few minutes. One of the recurring fears around made has to do [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1211.52s)]
*  with the idea of coercion or people feeling forced into it because they don't want to be a burden or [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1222.0800000000002s)]
*  maybe they don't feel like they can get proper care to alleviate their suffering. How does a [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1230.64s)]
*  made assessor make determinations in those kinds of examples? Because I don't know that somebody's [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1236.0s)]
*  going to say, I'm going through this because my kids think I'm being a burden or my partner thinks [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1242.08s)]
*  I'm going to be a burden or I'm pressured into this or I don't have the money. So how do you [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1249.36s)]
*  figure it out? Yeah, I learned this early on my first year. I had two patients around the same time [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1255.12s)]
*  who both had progressive neurological diseases. One of them was rich and she was rich in every way. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1262.64s)]
*  She had not only a beautiful home and money, but she had a loving husband and children and friends. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1269.76s)]
*  She had this rich life and she needed full care. She had her staff, she called them her staff, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  who did her caregiving. The man, on the other hand, lived in a horrible housing situation and [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1288.8s)]
*  he was poor in every way. He had no money. He had caregivers whom he fought with all the time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  And I thought, okay, so this guy got a million dollars and was able to afford [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1305.52s)]
*  staff and a home. What do you want to live longer? And I came back thinking, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1312.56s)]
*  they said the same things to me. The woman who was surrounded by this loving family in this beautiful [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1319.84s)]
*  home said, all I can do is get put into my recliner and sit there all day and then get put into bed [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1327.04s)]
*  and lie there all night. And that's all I can do. That's not good enough. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1338.48s)]
*  And the man said exactly the same thing. Life isn't good enough when all I can do is get put [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1342.8s)]
*  into a chair and sit there and then get put into bed and lie there. That's not life. And so, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1348.56s)]
*  we all struggle with this when we see that part of the suffering is the poverty or at least the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1356.88s)]
*  poverty makes their suffering worse. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1363.84s)]
*  Pete Slauson But maybe I am misunderstanding the story [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1365.52s)]
*  a little bit because didn't you just describe an instance where people were explicit with you about [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1368.72s)]
*  what they wanted? I mean, the material circumstances might have been different, but like, do you feel [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1373.44s)]
*  like you're able to determine whether or not people are being fully honest with you in those moments? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1377.92s)]
*  Linda Lundgren People can lie. Of course they can lie and I can be duped, absolutely. But [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1385.68s)]
*  I still have to go through my entire checklist and I have to know that they truly have the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1393.04s)]
*  grievous and irremediable medical condition, that they do understand their condition and its [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1400.8s)]
*  prognosis and the treatments and the alternatives. And I explore the suffering. You know, I don't [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1407.2s)]
*  just accept when people say the pain's too bad, but of course people can lie. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1414.72s)]
*  Pete Slauson Have you ever experienced situations [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1421.6000000000001s)]
*  where the family was unhappy with the made decision? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1426.4s)]
*  Linda Lundgren Oh, yes. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1430.0s)]
*  Pete Slauson What were the ripples from that? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1430.56s)]
*  Linda Lundgren Well, anger, of course. So, I've had a number of my patients who said, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1434.0s)]
*  I'm not telling mom. You get to tell her after I'm dead. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1441.84s)]
*  Pete Slauson Really? So, you? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1446.8s)]
*  Linda Lundgren So, I remember one family. The wife and brother were with my patient. He was only in [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1448.08s)]
*  his 40s, but he was at the end stage of a horrible, horrible cancer, death and suffering dreadfully. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1456.9599999999998s)]
*  And so, his brother was there and he says to my patient, you got to tell mom. And he said, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1463.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not telling mom. Well, I'm not telling mom. You've got to tell mom. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1470.0s)]
*  So, you know, we're dealing with complex family dynamics sometimes and we try to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1475.76s)]
*  negotiate a little and say, you know, I've said to many people, listen, you're going to be gone, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1484.32s)]
*  but they're left behind. What could you do to make it a little easier on them? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1490.4s)]
*  And so, you know, we talk about that and how could you write letters? Could you do videos? Could you [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1495.76s)]
*  do something to make it a little easier on them? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1502.56s)]
*  Pete Slauson You know, I feel that some of the critics have made, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1505.2s)]
*  I just think they're making some bad faith arguments. You know, you can sometimes get the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1511.44s)]
*  sense when you watch certain videos or read certain arguments that they think doctors are out here, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1516.32s)]
*  you know, champing at the bit to sign more people up for made and in sort of like a willy nilly [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1523.6s)]
*  fashion. And, you know, what do I know? But my sense is much more the doctors take these decisions [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1529.36s)]
*  very seriously and are following the rules and are not cavalier about it. So, I think there's just [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1535.36s)]
*  some kind of bogus arguing going on. But are there any arguments on the more liberal pro-made side [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1541.28s)]
*  that you think are maybe made in bad faith? Danielle Pletka [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1552.32s)]
*  Sorry, I can't think of one that is like that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1559.2s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. For me, one is, you know, sort of the push back against the slippery slope idea [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1563.12s)]
*  that, you know, if you allow people to do it, more people will do it. And it seems to me that that's [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1569.04s)]
*  obviously true. I think anywhere medical assistance in dying has been allowed, then, you know, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1574.8s)]
*  gradually the numbers go up. Danielle Pletka [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1582.08s)]
*  Yeah. There's a real change in the culture. So, now when I meet a new patient, they often tell me, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1583.92s)]
*  oh, I know my aunt had made or whatever. So, it has become part of the culture. They understand [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1591.84s)]
*  the whole issue, the process, because we've had it for nine years. And so, they know somebody. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1599.2s)]
*  And the other thing that makes it just part of the culture now is that when somebody gets a [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1607.52s)]
*  diagnosis, and, you know, three of my close friends had these diagnoses in the last nine years, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1615.04s)]
*  instantly, when you have that horrible diagnosis, you also know your options right from the beginning. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1623.68s)]
*  And of my close friends who had, one had made, one didn't, had a natural death, and the other is [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1632.16s)]
*  living way beyond his prognosis, quite amazingly. But it was there. Like, the one who didn't have it, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1643.92s)]
*  he talked about it. He said, if it ever gets too bad, that's what I want. And he kept deciding [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1652.88s)]
*  that it wasn't that bad, and he went through a natural death. So, that's what our culture is [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1659.92s)]
*  like now. It helps the people who don't have made, the one who's still living quite well. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1665.52s)]
*  I mean, he knows it's there. He knows that should his cancer lead to really unbearable suffering, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1673.28s)]
*  he's got a way out. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1681.6000000000001s)]
*  So, another thing that I was really thinking about with the experience with my mom was why [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1682.48s)]
*  doctors are involved in this decision at all. If we accept that people have a right to bodily [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1691.76s)]
*  autonomy and can make their own decisions about their own lives, why are doctors the ones who my [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1698.56s)]
*  mom had to go to and say, let me do this? I mean, I understand why we need doctors to administer [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1705.44s)]
*  in my mom's case, the injection. But isn't there something sort of paternalistic about doctors in [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1711.52s)]
*  this instance? Maternalistic. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1718.08s)]
*  Why? Why are they involved? So, I think that it's reasonable that our country decided to use doctors [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1719.36s)]
*  as the gatekeepers. It's not perfect. It's not necessarily even a full sort of human right. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1730.8s)]
*  But in general, our country trusts doctors to make decisions on the basis of patients' rights and [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1742.72s)]
*  patients' the good of the patient. And so, we are the trusted gatekeepers. And it's not perfect at [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1753.12s)]
*  all. I mean, another country like Australia, they give it to a committee. So, the doctors prepare [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  the documents for the committee, but it's a committee with a narcissist and lawyer and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1775.2s)]
*  doctors and so on who actually make the decision. So, that is another way of doing it that would not [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1780.24s)]
*  be just doctors. Why do you think it's reasonable that in Canada, doctors are the arbiters? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1786.4s)]
*  We help make assisted dying more accessible to patients than the Australian system, where [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1796.72s)]
*  it takes many weeks to get through that complex process. So, access is better. And [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1806.56s)]
*  we're not a faceless committee. We are people with faces and empathy and we're humans. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1815.2s)]
*  I want to go back again for a minute to my mom's situation. The doctor who helped my mom to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1826.64s)]
*  die, who was great. She just came in and made the family all feel comfortable and was very clear and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1835.6s)]
*  made my mom feel comfortable. I thought she did an amazing job. But after she asked my mom whether [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1841.84s)]
*  everything was clear to her or if there were any questions, my mom, she was so brave. She just said, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1849.76s)]
*  let's do it. But that's who my mom was. But after the drugs were injected and my mom was [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1854.9599999999998s)]
*  non-verbal, the doctor in a very caring way, sort of softly under her breath said, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1864.8s)]
*  looking at my mom, she's so in control. It was just such a moving thing to hear in that moment [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1872.72s)]
*  what I was really wanting to hear. But I also don't fully know what she meant when the doctor said [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1879.68s)]
*  that. And I wonder when you are in that situation, do you feel like you are seeing things in the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1886.32s)]
*  non-verbal patient or understanding something about what they're going through in that moment? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1894.16s)]
*  Well, remember that the drugs we give in Canada are a general anesthetic. And most people have [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1901.92s)]
*  had an experience with a general anesthetic, so they know exactly what it's like. We start [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1907.92s)]
*  with a sedative, so you just feel kind of sleepy and maybe a bit woozy. And then you're asleep. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1913.28s)]
*  And then you're in a deep coma and you know nothing. We know that in that process of going [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1919.84s)]
*  into coma, hearing is the latest thing to go. And so a lot of us would tell the loved ones around [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1926.08s)]
*  the bed, she can still hear you, or she probably can still hear you. And they'll say their last, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1935.76s)]
*  I love yous and that sort of thing in case they can still hear. But our method makes it very quick. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1944.56s)]
*  As you noticed, it's only minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think anything happens after people die? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1953.84s)]
*  No. No. I talk about this with all my patients, ask them what they think. So I know whether [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1961.44s)]
*  they're expecting an afterlife, but no, I don't personally expect an afterlife. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1971.2800000000002s)]
*  We know that most maid providers and most maid recipients tend to be not very spiritual. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1979.68s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  It's part of the entire attitude towards having control of your life. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=1990.32s)]
*  The kind of people who aren't religious, are well-educated, et cetera, are more likely to [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2004.72s)]
*  have choose made, whereas highly religious people, people very connected within certain [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2012.64s)]
*  ethnic groups, certain cultures are less likely to. I suspect my spiritual or religious beliefs are [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2019.2s)]
*  in line with yours. I don't think anything happens after we die and I don't really believe in a [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2029.6000000000001s)]
*  higher power. But there was something profound for me with my mom and really seeing somebody's [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2034.4s)]
*  alive, alive, alive, and then a second later they're dead. I just hadn't in any meaningful way been [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2043.52s)]
*  forced to confront the fact that the line between life and death is a heartbeat. It's a split second. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  And that was, I mean, maybe it sounds naive, it was kind of mind opening for me. Do you feel [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2064.56s)]
*  sort of wonderment or awe or a matter of factness about that transition from life to death? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2073.44s)]
*  No, it's an amazing transition for the person and for the family. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2084.0s)]
*  And earlier in my career, I delivered over a thousand babies and I was involved in families [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2090.8799999999997s)]
*  welcoming a new person into their lives. And that is also an incredibly profound experience. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2098.72s)]
*  And here people are saying goodbye for the last time to somebody who's been so important to them. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2105.2s)]
*  Last night, you know, the new widow said 57 years, I don't know how I'm going to go on without him. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2112.16s)]
*  So, you know, a profound change for this woman to now be a widow instead of a wife. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2123.8399999999997s)]
*  And so it's a profound experience. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2134.3199999999997s)]
*  Thinking of a doctor I was talking to told me this anecdote about a palliative care physician. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2137.04s)]
*  And that doctor said, you know, you should stop when the decisions you make don't bother you [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2144.16s)]
*  anymore. You feel so, or seem to me so comfortable and at ease with your work. Do you think your [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2149.76s)]
*  thing that a doctor can get too comfortable with? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2160.0s)]
*  Well, remember, we're doctors. So we're used to tragedies. We're used to being in other people's [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2171.6s)]
*  crises. So in order to do this, you have to be able to protect yourself. And you learn that in [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2178.88s)]
*  medical school, how to set boundaries and not take home other people's tragedies and make them [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2187.76s)]
*  your own. Or you couldn't do the work and you couldn't enjoy the work and find meaning and value [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2195.5200000000004s)]
*  in the work. And it's different for every person how they take that. For example, I spent 20 years [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2204.48s)]
*  working in the sexual assault service here in Vancouver. And that meant that I was spending [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2213.6s)]
*  time with women who had been assaulted, just assaulted, you know, and traumatized in a terrible [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2220.96s)]
*  way. And I was able to do that without taking on a lot of secondary trauma. And a whole lot of people [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2230.48s)]
*  can't, you know, one of my friends joined the service briefly and said, I can't get back into [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2244.16s)]
*  bed with my husband after I've come away from a sexual assault case. So I better quit. And she did [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2249.28s)]
*  and she's still married, which is great. So, you know, you have to know yourself, you have to know [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2256.88s)]
*  what you can tolerate and what you can do. But if you set boundaries so strongly that you no longer [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2262.0s)]
*  have empathy, you no longer care about the people, then you've gone too far. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2270.4s)]
*  After the break, I called Dr. Weeb back to ask about the dangers in all the different works she [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2281.1200000000003s)]
*  does. Well, I must say that the anti-abortion people are worse. They shoot and stab my colleagues [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2285.84s)]
*  and threaten me with death, whereas the anti-maid protesters are more likely to pray for me. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2293.84s)]
*  Hi, Dr. Weeb. How are you? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2315.84s)]
*  Good. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2323.44s)]
*  So in addition to your work with Maid, you've been an abortion provider for a long time. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2325.2000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2332.2400000000002s)]
*  You touched on this a little bit earlier, but I want to know more about the connection between [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2332.96s)]
*  that work and your maid work beyond the fact that they both have to do with bodily autonomy. I mean, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2338.7200000000003s)]
*  you're dealing with patients at two such different phases of life. What is the emotional [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2344.88s)]
*  interplay there for you? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2350.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, I love going between, you know, I'm dealing with young women in the morning who are, you know, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2352.32s)]
*  planning their lives around, you know, having children, not having children, having the choices [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2360.0s)]
*  over what they want to do. And then in the afternoon, I might be seeing somebody who's [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2367.76s)]
*  planning their death. It's a wonderful balance for me. So besides bodily autonomy, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2373.68s)]
*  the social constructs are very interesting because in Canada and the US, the majority of people are [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2381.6s)]
*  pro-choice. The majority of people believe that women should have the right to control their bodies [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  and people should be able to control their deaths. And yet there's still a lot of stigma. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2397.04s)]
*  There's a difficulty with access for both. And there's difficulty with finding enough providers, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2404.8s)]
*  finding spaces, finding all these things. So it's very interesting. And, you know, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  the same people are against me. I've had lots of anti-abortion people against me and now anti-maid [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2421.52s)]
*  people against me. So yeah, there's quite a few similarities. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2428.64s)]
*  Do you find that opponents of abortion and maid demonize the work in similar ways? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2434.56s)]
*  Well, I must say that the anti-abortion people are worse. They shoot and stab my colleagues [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2441.28s)]
*  and threaten me with death. Whereas the anti-maid protesters are more likely to [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2448.72s)]
*  pray for me, which is fine. So they are less violent, which is good. But their rhetoric is [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2456.3999999999996s)]
*  similar. I mean, I'm of course called a serial murderer. There was a colleague of yours in [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2465.04s)]
*  Vancouver in around 2000 or so who was shot. And stabbed. The same colleague. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2470.0s)]
*  Can you tell me that story? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2476.16s)]
*  He was having breakfast in his home and someone shot him through the window and hit his groin. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2479.44s)]
*  He almost died of blood loss and had to have a number of surgeries and did recover and did [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2490.7999999999997s)]
*  go back to work. And then a few years later, someone stabbed him at work. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2497.2s)]
*  Did that give you pause about doing the kind of work you do? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2503.76s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I had to look around me. I still had young children and I had to look into myself [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2509.76s)]
*  and decide, you know, if I'm going to be anxious all the time, that's not a good thing. But my [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2518.6400000000003s)]
*  anxiety dropped and I was able to continue the work. And now it's much less, there's much less [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2525.44s)]
*  violence against abortion providers. So there was a time when I was wearing a bulletproof vest to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2532.8s)]
*  work every day. And did that those feelings of anxiety just ebb over time because you weren't [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2539.52s)]
*  getting threats in the same way? Or did you just acclimate to a higher level of anxiety? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2546.0800000000004s)]
*  No, I mean, it just went away. I'm not an anxious person. So it's not surprising that my anxiety, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2551.44s)]
*  that particular, you know, the day Gary was shot, you know, then I was anxious. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2559.52s)]
*  Do you think an anxious person could do the kind of work you do? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2566.4s)]
*  Well, each of us handle our anxieties in our own ways. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2571.12s)]
*  In your work as an OBGYN, you know, I imagine that you've dealt with maternal death or sort of [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2576.8s)]
*  unexpected infant death. Have those experiences sort of colored your understanding of your [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2584.56s)]
*  made work? Well, being a doctor means you work with tragedy. I was so lucky to be involved in [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2593.04s)]
*  delivering babies and did, you know, over a thousand. And almost always there's great joy [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2602.56s)]
*  in the room. But of course, when it's the parents who are crying and the baby is not, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2608.72s)]
*  then it's horrible tragedy and grief. And so that's part of being a doctor. And I've been [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2615.68s)]
*  a doctor for a long time. I don't know that every doctor necessarily accepts that. I mean, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2624.7999999999997s)]
*  there are all kinds of doctors who, I think, not only don't often deal with tragedy, but maybe even [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2629.8399999999997s)]
*  are wanting to avoid having to deal with tragedy. So I wonder if you have a perception of what [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2637.52s)]
*  medicine is fundamentally about that also has something to do with why you do the kind of work [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2643.92s)]
*  that you do that is maybe not shared by all doctors? Well, for example, not all doctors want [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2650.8s)]
*  to do palliative care, even though most specialties have people dying. But, you know, what I couldn't [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2658.32s)]
*  tolerate and was so grateful I didn't have to deal with hardly ever was the dying children. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2667.36s)]
*  So I really admired the pediatricians who could work with these very, very seriously ill children [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2675.52s)]
*  and dying children because that one just freaked me out. So we all have our limitations. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2682.56s)]
*  I could deal with adults and their tragedies, but when it came to the children, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2690.0s)]
*  I couldn't. So that was a little too hard. Yeah. You know, my mom's death and, you know, the [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2697.2s)]
*  the bravery that she showed, she was just really had, she seemed to me lacking in fear [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2708.3999999999996s)]
*  and thinking about it since she died just made me realize there's just so much [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2719.52s)]
*  bullshit in my life that I need to be braver about. Like if she can be brave about that, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2726.4799999999996s)]
*  I certainly need to be braver about some of the basically inconsequential things that I feel like [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2732.16s)]
*  I'm not brave enough about in my life. And that's something that I feel like I'm [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2736.56s)]
*  now carrying with me that I wasn't before. You know, so for you, a person who's around death so [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2741.12s)]
*  much, has your experience with death taught you anything about what makes a good life? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2746.96s)]
*  Oh, yes. I mean, my patients teach me so much about that. And, you know, I mean, at my age, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2755.04s)]
*  obviously, I've lost loved ones, not just my parents. So that helps to make you realize [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2763.44s)]
*  what's important in life. We just had Canadian Thanksgiving. And so I saw all my kids and, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2772.32s)]
*  and, you know, these are the important, really important things and spending time with friends [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2779.68s)]
*  and being with patients and everything I do. I mean, I feel like everything I do should be [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2787.44s)]
*  worthwhile or fun, preferably both. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2794.88s)]
*  That's Dr. Ellen Wiebe. In the weeks following my conversation with Wiebe, a judge in British [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2804.88s)]
*  Columbia issued a rare temporary injunction preventing the medically assisted death of a [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2810.16s)]
*  53-year-old woman who had been approved by Wiebe for mate. This was in response to a civil claim [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2815.36s)]
*  from the woman's partner that Wiebe had wrongly approved the procedure because the patient's [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2820.96s)]
*  condition was mental, not physical. The case is still pending and Wiebe declined to comment. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIvNuOfKuY&t=2826.08s)]
