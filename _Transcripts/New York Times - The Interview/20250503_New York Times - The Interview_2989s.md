# Poet Ocean Vuong on Suffering, Kindness and Stepping Back From Abyss | The Interview
**New York Times - The Interview:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8)
*  David Marquese, Interview with David Marquese [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=0.0s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=4.9s)]
*  I'm David Marquese. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=6.96s)]
*  In a lot of ways, Ocean Vuong's life makes for a classic American success story. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=8.84s)]
*  He and his mother came to this country as refugees from Vietnam in 1990, when he was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=14.96s)]
*  just a small child. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=20.16s)]
*  They landed in Hartford, Connecticut, and pretty quickly fell into a hardscrabble existence [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=22.04s)]
*  ruled by low-paying work and low expectations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=26.76s)]
*  Until that is, Ocean discovered literature and his own gift for writing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=29.96s)]
*  Vuong is now one of the country's most esteemed poets, winner of a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=35.0s)]
*  also known as a Genius Grant, and he's a professor in the creative writing department [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=40.4s)]
*  at New York University. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=44.2s)]
*  His debut novel, On Earth Were Briefly Gorgeous, came out in 2019 and became a bestseller and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=46.16s)]
*  a bona fide millennial classic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=51.2s)]
*  All this, and he's still only 36 years old. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  But there's another side to Vuong's story, and that's about the flipside of success and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=57.56s)]
*  lingering pain of his mixed-up youth. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=62.36s)]
*  It's that part of his story, the one that doesn't resolve so neatly, that lies at the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=65.48s)]
*  heart of his new novel, The Emperor of Gladness. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=69.72s)]
*  It's a bigger book in every respect than his first, in a way that makes Vuong kind of nervous [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=73.28s)]
*  about how it'll be received. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=77.4s)]
*  I'll say too that the book was a launching pad for what turned out to be one of the most [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=79.76s)]
*  emotionally intense interviews I think I've ever done. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=82.88s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Ocean Vuong. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=88.0s)]
*  So thank you for taking the time to do this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=98.64s)]
*  Thank you, David. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=99.64s)]
*  Pleasure. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=100.64s)]
*  So, Emperor of Gladness, your new novel, is based, at least in part, on your experiences [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=101.64s)]
*  working at fast food restaurants in small town Connecticut. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  So where did you work and what were the jobs? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  I worked at a place called Boston Market and a place called Panera. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=115.68s)]
*  And I was living in hud housing, this one-bedroom apartment with my mother and my brother. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=119.84s)]
*  It was this kind of situation where if your family income surpassed, then you can't live [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=125.6s)]
*  there anymore. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=130.28s)]
*  But the next housing opportunity would be unaffordable to us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=131.52s)]
*  So my mother literally said, you know, when you get a job, just work at McDonald's to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=134.4s)]
*  stay under. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=139.12s)]
*  It was McDonald's, $7.15 an hour, which is minimum wage. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=140.12s)]
*  And in the summers, I worked on a tobacco farm, which is $9.50 cash. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=143.12s)]
*  No Uncle Sam involved. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  So you confront as a teenager immediately this kind of like, antithesis of like, American [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=149.12s)]
*  prosperity and upward mobility, where it's like, don't make too much money or we'll be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  homeless. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=158.52s)]
*  But a lot of people had that predicament. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=159.52s)]
*  So I went to Boston Market, which is now like a very eye-opening experience of American [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=162.28s)]
*  life, I think. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=170.64s)]
*  What did you learn about people from working at Boston Market and Panera Bread? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=171.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, I learned that everything is about deception, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=175.72s)]
*  We didn't cook anything. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=179.2s)]
*  The entire thing was a series of microwaves in various, you know, it's taking frozen sacks [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=180.44s)]
*  of food in giant plastic bags, reheating it and then presenting wholesome home-cooked [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=186.8s)]
*  meals. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=193.56s)]
*  But what I learned was, you know, we have this idea of American life being the nuclear [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=194.56s)]
*  family. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=198.76s)]
*  But I think a huge portion of how this country is formed is through circumstantial family, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=199.76s)]
*  labor, this arbitrary cobbling of strangers thrown together. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=205.96s)]
*  And then we have to kind of sacrifice relationships with our own family in order to be here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=213.04s)]
*  And yet, intimacies arise despite that, because human beings, no matter where they are, will [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=219.24s)]
*  find bounding relationships. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=226.08s)]
*  And a month in, you'll start to know whose cough belongs to who. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=228.28s)]
*  You'll know when, you know, Joe's drugstore deodorant will wear off, at which hour, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=233.24s)]
*  I'm like, we're at the third hour, I'm going to start to smell his B.O. underneath the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=239.0s)]
*  deodorant. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=243.76s)]
*  And there's nothing more intimate than that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=244.76s)]
*  But you also, you're so dependent on each other. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=246.8s)]
*  You know, I'm not a soldier, so I would never compare it to war. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=249.76s)]
*  But it's just kind of like going through a battle sometimes, especially when, you know, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=253.64s)]
*  you're about to close and a purple bus pulls up and it's a bunch of Catholic school kids [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=258.8s)]
*  after their prom and you're slammed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=263.48s)]
*  And you have to depend on each other. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=266.38s)]
*  There's a kindness that arises out of that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=269.04s)]
*  There's also a deep frustration. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=272.6s)]
*  What frustration? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=274.92s)]
*  That underneath it all, every employee kind of knows that this is not it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=275.92s)]
*  This is not the way out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=280.94s)]
*  And it's kind of the elephant in the room. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=282.8s)]
*  And the manager is paid just a little more than us. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=285.52s)]
*  I think at that time, they were paid maybe 13 to 15. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=288.32s)]
*  We were paid 7.15. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=292.36s)]
*  So, you know, almost double. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=294.32s)]
*  But the suffering that they went through showed us it wasn't enough. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=295.8s)]
*  I watched someone get promoted and then turn it down. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=301.04s)]
*  We had this ceremony. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=305.28s)]
*  We're promoting somebody. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=306.76s)]
*  And it was a grand thing where the manager came out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=307.76s)]
*  We closed the store and said, all right, you know, we're going to promote Jennifer today [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=311.46s)]
*  and welcome Jennifer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=315.56s)]
*  And she's just like, I don't want it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  She didn't want the responsibility. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=320.76s)]
*  It was a slightly different setting. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=324.2s)]
*  But I worked as a waiter for a catering company. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=325.2s)]
*  And so much of what you just said paralleled exactly my experience of that, the way you're [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=328.32s)]
*  just sort of thrown in with this group of disparate people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=332.76s)]
*  Somehow you make it work. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=336.12s)]
*  You know, people get on your nerves. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=337.12s)]
*  There's other people you like. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=338.12s)]
*  There's people you can rely on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=339.12s)]
*  There's people you can rely on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=340.12s)]
*  But at the end of the night, everyone has done their jobs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=341.8s)]
*  But I will say, we worked a lot of bar mitzvahs and weddings and the parties for that, you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  know, anniversaries, retirement parties. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=350.12s)]
*  That's what I realized, like that you learn so much about people from the way they treat [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=352.88s)]
*  their presumed subordinates. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=357.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=359.52s)]
*  I think it's interesting because the fast food restaurant in a way obfuscates the workers' [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=360.52s)]
*  humanity because everyone's in a uniform. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=366.0s)]
*  You're just hands. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=369.04s)]
*  Your most valuable asset are your hands, not your personhood. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think there's what I'm interested in this novel and in my life in general is when [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=375.22s)]
*  humanity breaches these moments. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=380.68s)]
*  To this day, I think it's almost 20 years ago now, but till the end of my life, I will [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=383.64s)]
*  remember this one moment. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=389.24s)]
*  I was being trained by this man named Ruben. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=391.56s)]
*  One day we were cleaning the freezer. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=395.26s)]
*  And I don't know what to do with this fact, but it's just I didn't put it in the book [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=397.88s)]
*  because it's too dramatic. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=401.32s)]
*  You know, sometimes life is like both cornier and more dramatic than any fiction you can [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=403.24s)]
*  do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=409.08s)]
*  But it's been haunting me forever. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=410.68s)]
*  I'm 19 and we have our backs together. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=413.8s)]
*  It's like maybe like six foot wide. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=419.72s)]
*  It's almost touching. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=423.4s)]
*  We're just cleaning. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=424.4s)]
*  And we're talking about family. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=425.4s)]
*  And he stops and he says this thing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=426.4s)]
*  His head is back to me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=429.16s)]
*  He says, you know, it's something I can never tell my wife. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=430.6s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=434.4s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=435.88s)]
*  He says, I have three sons and I only love one of them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=436.88s)]
*  And all I know how to do is just give affirmative. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know how to receive this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=446.04s)]
*  And I said, oh, okay. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=447.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=450.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=451.24s)]
*  He says, you know, there's nothing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=452.24s)]
*  I have no real connection with the son that I love. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=455.64s)]
*  And the others do right by me. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=459.96s)]
*  I do right by them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=461.56s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=462.56s)]
*  But I knew it early on. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=465.0s)]
*  And he's like, just watch out in life. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=466.6s)]
*  That's going to happen. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=468.64s)]
*  You're supposed to love people, but you're going to find out that God chooses these things [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=469.64s)]
*  for you. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=473.56s)]
*  And to this day, I don't know what it means, but I thought it was just such an incredible [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=476.2s)]
*  Did that ever come up again? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=480.4s)]
*  No. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=482.4s)]
*  And I said, why did that happen? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=483.4s)]
*  Why in a freezer in East Hartford, Connecticut, does a man tell me something that I think [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=486.4s)]
*  has only been uttered in that freezer to this day? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=495.88s)]
*  Well, you know, that story and your book and the experience you described of working at [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=496.88s)]
*  a fast food restaurant really connect for me to a larger question I have about the country [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=503.0s)]
*  and how we understand each other. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  The Ember of Gladness is set in this small town in Connecticut, and it's a town where [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=513.04s)]
*  seems like they're not great job prospects. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=518.66s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of poverty. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=520.78s)]
*  What do you understand about places like East Hartford that maybe doesn't get communicated [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=523.54s)]
*  widely enough? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=530.3s)]
*  You know, I think as a culture, we always want this sort of grand arc. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=532.4s)]
*  Rags to riches. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=538.74s)]
*  Gets the girl. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=540.0999999999999s)]
*  Gets the guy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=541.0999999999999s)]
*  We know where the body is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=542.0999999999999s)]
*  We know who the killer is. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=543.4s)]
*  It's like the Scooby-Doo effect. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=544.4s)]
*  You always get the unmasking and if there's a payoff. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=546.06s)]
*  And I just wondered if I could write a book that didn't have improvement arcs, you know, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=550.38s)]
*  because it also aligned with like my observation of my communities. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=557.26s)]
*  My brother has worked at Dick's Sporting Goods his whole life. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=562.2199999999999s)]
*  My stepdad works at this auto parts company called Stanadyne. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=565.5s)]
*  Are they still both in Connecticut? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=569.7399999999999s)]
*  They're both in Connecticut. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=572.14s)]
*  For 25 years, he worked from 3 p.m. to 12 a.m. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=573.54s)]
*  I never saw him. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=577.42s)]
*  I came home from school at four. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=578.62s)]
*  I only saw him on the weekends. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=580.4599999999999s)]
*  He would sleep in. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=582.8199999999999s)]
*  I saw like a tuft of hair poking out of the blanket in his room. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=583.8199999999999s)]
*  That was it, you know. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  And so I just thought we want stories of change. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=589.9s)]
*  We believe in it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=596.0999999999999s)]
*  We buy it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=597.0999999999999s)]
*  And yet, American life, even at its best, is often static. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=598.22s)]
*  You drive the same car. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=605.7s)]
*  I know people who live in the same apartment. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=606.78s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that their lives are worthless, that it's meaningless, that they failed, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=609.22s)]
*  So I'm interested in like re-identifying the idea of the loser or loserdom, like economic [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=613.9s)]
*  losers, the left behind. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=620.74s)]
*  In my first book, it's a queer story about someone who never leaves, you know, because [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=622.52s)]
*  the queer story is always ameliorated when you go to the city. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=627.5s)]
*  I'm like, some of us can't afford to. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=630.5s)]
*  Some of us have elders to care. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=633.02s)]
*  Some of us need to be gay in the cornfield because there's nowhere else to go. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=634.96s)]
*  And so this book, it's not a spoiler to say that nobody gets a better job. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=639.7s)]
*  No one gets a raise. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=643.6s)]
*  So what happens? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=645.22s)]
*  You get people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=646.22s)]
*  And what I've been really interested in is this idea of kindness without hope. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=647.22s)]
*  What I saw working in the fast food, growing up in Hartford County, was that people were [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=652.5s)]
*  kind even when they know it won't matter. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=657.7s)]
*  What is that? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=660.74s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=662.54s)]
*  You know, like, you know that whatever you're going to do is not going to help someone materially, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=664.1800000000001s)]
*  jumping their car. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=670.3000000000001s)]
*  I watched coworkers get together and dig each other out of blizzards before anyone could [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=671.3000000000001s)]
*  go home. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  They could just dig themselves out and leave. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  Go home sooner, hug their families. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=680.3399999999999s)]
*  But they all stayed and they dug each other out. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=682.06s)]
*  You know, the generosity that my neighbors had. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=685.0999999999999s)]
*  Growing up in a black and brown community, we were invited into Baptist Church. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=688.54s)]
*  We knew no English. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=692.62s)]
*  They gave us free bread. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=693.9799999999999s)]
*  And I just said, where? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=695.8599999999999s)]
*  What is kindness that is exhibited knowing there's no payoff? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=698.3s)]
*  Where do you think it comes from? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=703.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=704.74s)]
*  I write, you know, David, I've been really interested in kindness as an intrinsic thing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=705.94s)]
*  and goodness as an intrinsic thing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=714.5400000000001s)]
*  Like my brother just has it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=716.22s)]
*  He came with kindness. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=718.98s)]
*  I never had it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=720.34s)]
*  I had a desire to understand goodness, but I never had it the way like my brother does. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=721.98s)]
*  And I know because I raised him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=729.34s)]
*  My parents were at the factories in a nail salon, were 10 years apart. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=731.3399999999999s)]
*  So I was holding a little baby in my arms as a 10-year-old feeding him milk. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, I raised him. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=742.26s)]
*  I didn't give him that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=743.66s)]
*  He had it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=745.5799999999999s)]
*  And I'm just interested in that because it's strange to me. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=746.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't know it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=750.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, it doesn't come natural to me. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=751.3399999999999s)]
*  And I've been in dicey situations in my life where I realized that very early on I just [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=753.06s)]
*  don't have it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=758.0999999999999s)]
*  You exhibited cruelty? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=760.1s)]
*  I don't know if it would be cruelty, but I think certain anger, certain rage, certain [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=762.9s)]
*  desires that I think would have never exhibited in someone like my brother. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=767.94s)]
*  And there was a moment when I was 15 that I think I've been trying to articulate this [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=774.86s)]
*  for so long. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=781.62s)]
*  And your question is now putting me down the slippery slope. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=782.62s)]
*  I've been trying to articulate it because I think it's important, but I've been really [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=786.1s)]
*  ashamed of it because people ask me, you know, why did you become a writer? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=789.1s)]
*  And I give the answer that I think makes sense. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=793.82s)]
*  I went to Pace. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=797.78s)]
*  I tried business school because I wanted to help my mother and I couldn't do it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=798.78s)]
*  And then I went to Brooklyn and I went to the English department and I became a writer. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=802.94s)]
*  That's not untrue. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=808.5s)]
*  I don't know if it's honest, you know, and your question is now bringing me to this idea [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=809.5s)]
*  of cruelty and goodness. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=815.2s)]
*  I would say that there was this one event when I was 15 that I do think altered the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=819.0600000000001s)]
*  course of my life, although at that time it was not an epiphanic moment. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=825.3000000000001s)]
*  Like, I didn't say, oh, you know, but I would say that the desire to be a writer probably [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=830.0600000000001s)]
*  started with the desire to commit myself to understanding suffering. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=835.74s)]
*  What was the moment? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=842.46s)]
*  I'm trying to be eloquent with this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=843.46s)]
*  I don't know if I will be. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=847.06s)]
*  When I was 15, I'll say it first and I'll describe it, right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=850.3s)]
*  When I was 15, I decided to kill somebody. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=859.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=863.98s)]
*  I didn't do it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=866.54s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=868.54s)]
*  I was working on this bagel farm every summer and I rode my bike every day. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=874.82s)]
*  I didn't have a car. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=882.34s)]
*  I didn't have a license. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=883.34s)]
*  I was about five miles out. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=884.34s)]
*  You wake up at six in the morning. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=886.34s)]
*  I rode my bike and I went to work mostly with migrant farmers. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=887.82s)]
*  You get paid under the table. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=891.74s)]
*  And if you show up every day, you get a $1,000 bonus at the end of the season. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=895.0200000000001s)]
*  It was this hot July evening. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=901.86s)]
*  I was in my room and I look out the window and I see that someone has stolen my bike. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=905.5799999999999s)]
*  And it was someone I knew in the neighborhood who was a drug dealer. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=910.98s)]
*  And it was a time, it was like 2002, 2003. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  So everybody's outside. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=919.06s)]
*  There's no indoor kids, at least not in my neighborhood. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=921.54s)]
*  So you would put your bike outside in the stoop when you're running in and out. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=924.22s)]
*  This guy was known to just grab your bike and he would never give it back to you. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=929.3s)]
*  It was just very, you know, there's nothing you could do about it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=932.8199999999999s)]
*  He was like a sloppy thief, basically. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=936.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=937.3s)]
*  But he kind of knew, like he just didn't, the idea wasn't to steal. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=938.06s)]
*  It was kind of like power. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=940.8199999999999s)]
*  It was kind of... [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=942.14s)]
*  He was showing you he could take your bike. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=943.86s)]
*  And whenever he needed it, he'll just grab a kid's bike. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=944.86s)]
*  And you were under the mercy of it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=948.38s)]
*  So it was a chronic thing. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=950.14s)]
*  But I just snapped that day. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=956.38s)]
*  Like I just saw him and I was so angry because I knew, I knew, I knew I'm like, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=958.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to get this back. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=964.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to lose my thousand dollars. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=965.14s)]
*  And for context, like when I ended up doing my mom's taxes, she made $13,000. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=967.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=973.74s)]
*  And what I did was he's riding around this people, you know, and I go out and I said, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=975.38s)]
*  just give me back my bike, you know. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=979.54s)]
*  And essentially he just said, F off. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=982.74s)]
*  And I knew that, that's the vibe. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=986.18s)]
*  But I just, I think that day I lost it, you know. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=989.5s)]
*  I was on drugs at the time, you know. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=992.78s)]
*  I had my first cigarette when I was 14. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=994.98s)]
*  Two weeks later, I'm doing lines of coke in the high school dugout in the baseball. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=996.9s)]
*  But I was sober that day, right. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1001.78s)]
*  It got worse in the farm because the migrant workers were using it too. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1004.62s)]
*  You take a bump to do the work. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1008.34s)]
*  To get through the day. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1009.8199999999999s)]
*  And they loved that I did it because I was a kid and they kind of took me under... [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1011.38s)]
*  It was kind of really toxic, you know. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1015.5s)]
*  But that day it was clear and I went across the street diagonal to my friend Big Joe's [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1017.94s)]
*  house. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1023.86s)]
*  I knocked on his window. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1025.34s)]
*  I remember putting both of my hands on the window sill and I have no shirt on. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1029.06s)]
*  I'm just sweating. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1033.86s)]
*  I'm so angry. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1034.86s)]
*  And I just told him, I said, please let me borrow your gun. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1038.78s)]
*  You don't have to finish the story. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1046.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1049.14s)]
*  Can I give you a hug? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1051.86s)]
*  Would you? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1052.86s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1055.46s)]
*  I really appreciate that you're being honest. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1058.02s)]
*  But if it's too much, we can just stop. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1060.18s)]
*  So you just tell me, okay? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1062.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1063.54s)]
*  It's... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1066.94s)]
*  I think what I'm trying to get at is that I didn't become an author just to like... [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1067.94s)]
*  My goal was not to like have a photo in the back of a book and be like an author. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1074.18s)]
*  Writing became a medium for me to try to understand like what goodness is. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1079.98s)]
*  Because when I was begging my friend, I said, please give me your gun. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1086.82s)]
*  And I know that gun because we used it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1093.42s)]
*  We would shoot it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1095.5s)]
*  He would take me to the woods and we would just shoot. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1096.5s)]
*  And I just so... [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1101.34s)]
*  I'm like, please just get out of the bush real quick. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1102.34s)]
*  And I had it in my head. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1104.6599999999999s)]
*  I imagined it in my head. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1105.78s)]
*  And he said, I'm not going to do that. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1109.3s)]
*  He said, I'm not going to do that. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1114.22s)]
*  You need to go home. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1116.58s)]
*  And I think what was really so touching to me is that I was not responsible for that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1119.22s)]
*  Someone else had better send safe. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1126.62s)]
*  And there's in Buddhism, we have this idea called Satori. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1129.38s)]
*  And... [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1135.18s)]
*  Explain what that is. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1136.18s)]
*  Satori is kind of enlightenment, but it's enlightenment in life. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1137.18s)]
*  These kind of brief moments of illumination. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1141.22s)]
*  And you've probably experienced it like, you know, I'm laying in bed at night. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1144.98s)]
*  I can't sleep. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1148.8600000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you realize, I need to be a better partner. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1149.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to wake up. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1153.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be a better brother. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1154.8600000000001s)]
*  I got to be more patient. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1155.8600000000001s)]
*  I got to stop being petty. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1157.38s)]
*  Like these moments, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1158.66s)]
*  And then you wake up and then life happens. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1161.5400000000002s)]
*  You get a bad work email. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1163.2600000000002s)]
*  Someone's being annoyed. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1165.9s)]
*  And then you lose sight of all that. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1166.9s)]
*  So Satori is like a brief window. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1168.46s)]
*  And the idea for Buddhists is to then allow the understanding in that brief window to [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1171.14s)]
*  then alter your life. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1177.3400000000001s)]
*  And monks, some monks widen that window probably for the rest of their life. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1179.94s)]
*  That window is their life's width. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1184.5s)]
*  For me, I get little brief moments. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1187.26s)]
*  And I think I was spared that horrible outcome because of Big Joe Satori. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1189.42s)]
*  And any other day, he would have done it, right? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1197.5800000000002s)]
*  But he saw that it's not going to be good. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1200.3s)]
*  And it was his wisdom. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1203.18s)]
*  And you know, you tell yourself, you control your life and all that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1205.78s)]
*  But moments like that happen and you're just like, wow, I don't know. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  So it was up to me that I got here with somebody else. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1215.62s)]
*  A week after that, I went to the public library because I would take my grandmother to the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1220.3s)]
*  library. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1226.1399999999999s)]
*  And she was schizophrenic. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1227.1399999999999s)]
*  So she was kind of like a thousand Asian grandmas in one. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1228.1399999999999s)]
*  So she kept making altars all over the house. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1231.6999999999998s)]
*  And she would go to the library and she would steal pictures of Buddha and frame it for [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1235.06s)]
*  her altars. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1240.34s)]
*  I would just sit there and she would just sit there and just cut out and put it in a [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1241.8600000000001s)]
*  folder. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1246.42s)]
*  And then I started to like, I'm like, what is this book? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1247.42s)]
*  You know, let me just read this. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1251.26s)]
*  What was the book? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1253.26s)]
*  I would just start reading Buddhism books. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1254.26s)]
*  But then I end up in the Buddhism religion section, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1256.38s)]
*  And I would go back by myself and I was deeply interested in like understanding this suffering. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1260.38s)]
*  And Buddhism was so enticing for me serendipitously because the Four Noble Truths, like life is [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1266.94s)]
*  suffering. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1271.42s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, yes, I'm in there. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1272.42s)]
*  And it's like, you are not your past. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1277.5800000000002s)]
*  You can alter your life. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1280.66s)]
*  You don't have to wait for anybody. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1281.66s)]
*  You don't have to negotiate with a higher being because Buddhism is all about action. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1283.02s)]
*  It's all about your conduct. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1287.42s)]
*  And I was trying to find a way out. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1289.5800000000002s)]
*  And I went to my guidance counselor and I told him, I said, there's a university called [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1291.66s)]
*  of the West where you can study a liberal arts degree and then become a monk. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1296.94s)]
*  I said, I want to help me, help me get there. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1302.22s)]
*  And he said, I would love to get you there, but it's not accredited. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1305.02s)]
*  And I think if you want to go to school, you should have a real degree and then you could [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1309.74s)]
*  still be a monk. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1314.7s)]
*  So he persuaded me to go to community college. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1316.14s)]
*  My first class there, the syllabus was Baldwin, Annie Dillard, Foucault. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1318.94s)]
*  And I realized writing was not like writing a good respectable email to get a job. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1326.38s)]
*  It was a medium of understanding suffering. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1331.0200000000002s)]
*  That's when it changed. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1334.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1336.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, as we move forward, you should definitely just feel free to tell me if you need a break [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1337.6200000000001s)]
*  or if anything feels too intense because I'm looking at my questions. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1343.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, it's not going to get easier. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1348.8200000000002s)]
*  I didn't think I would be here this quick either. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1350.8600000000001s)]
*  But you know, I realize in the way I've described the novel, I've elided one of the most important [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1354.9s)]
*  aspects of the story. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1364.5s)]
*  And that's the central relationship of the novel is between a young Vietnamese immigrant [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1366.74s)]
*  character named Hai and an 82 year old Lithuanian woman whose name is Gretzina. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1373.5800000000002s)]
*  And Hai winds up through sort of a series of twists and turns becoming a caregiver for [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1382.02s)]
*  Gretzina who has dementia. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1387.82s)]
*  And the novel is dedicated to a real life Gretzina. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1390.78s)]
*  Can you tell me about who she was and what your relationship with her was? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1396.42s)]
*  She's my partner's grandmother. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1400.62s)]
*  I wanted to dedicate the book to her. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1402.5s)]
*  I wanted to use her name to honor her as a real person. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1405.02s)]
*  But long story short, after I dropped out of Pace University, I lost housing. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1410.3400000000001s)]
*  Then I applied to Brooklyn College. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1415.7s)]
*  I got in, but I didn't have a place to live. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1418.02s)]
*  I was couch surfing. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1420.78s)]
*  That quickly ran out. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1422.8200000000002s)]
*  And I hesitate to call myself homeless because it was just two and a half weeks. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1424.78s)]
*  I stayed in Penn Station for two and a half weeks. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1429.02s)]
*  But it was not the way you think. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1430.98s)]
*  I was a student at Brooklyn College. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1431.98s)]
*  I had a library. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1434.06s)]
*  I had a computer. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1435.06s)]
*  But I would go to sleep in Penn Station in the Long Island Railroad sector underneath [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1437.1s)]
*  Madison Square Garden. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1441.4599999999998s)]
*  It's very warm. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1442.4599999999998s)]
*  And what I would do is I would print out a fake ticket. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1443.4599999999998s)]
*  And that would get you into the red hat area where it's much more comfortable. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1446.54s)]
*  Sort of a waiting lounge. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1449.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1450.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1451.6599999999999s)]
*  So I would do that until like 5.30. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1452.6599999999999s)]
*  Then I would wake up and I would take the one and two down to Flatbush, go to the library [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1453.6599999999999s)]
*  in the corner and sleep until my first class at nine or 10. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1459.1s)]
*  And just one day, my partner, we were dating at the time. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1463.78s)]
*  And he was living in Queens. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1468.94s)]
*  But he was going home that day to Long Island. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1470.3400000000001s)]
*  And I got to Penn Station. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1474.54s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to Seaford. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1475.54s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1477.54s)]
*  I was like, I'm here. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1479.54s)]
*  It was kind of sweet, but very strange in a way. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1482.78s)]
*  And he was like, oh my god. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1487.42s)]
*  And I was like, all right, well, he's just jarred and we left. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1488.9s)]
*  I'm just sorry. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1493.9s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1494.9s)]
*  You wouldn't have to talk again. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1495.9s)]
*  This is really weird. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1496.9s)]
*  I'll text you. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1497.9s)]
*  And then the next day he called me. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1499.42s)]
*  He says, I talked to my mom, my grandmother. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1500.7s)]
*  She was actually 84 at the time. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1506.3000000000002s)]
*  She lives in Richmond Hill. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1508.66s)]
*  She thought she will not go anywhere. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1510.42s)]
*  She's an immigrant. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1513.46s)]
*  It's her first American home. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1514.46s)]
*  She raised two kids there. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1516.22s)]
*  Her husband's gone. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1518.62s)]
*  She won't go, but she has some illness. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1519.62s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1521.62s)]
*  I just thought I was going to help someone take vitamins. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1522.62s)]
*  And I ended up living there for two and a half years while I was studying. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1526.62s)]
*  Helping take care of her. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1531.62s)]
*  Take care of her. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1532.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1533.62s)]
*  I mean, I was 20, 21. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1534.62s)]
*  But what was interesting was that we kind of started like a family. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1537.62s)]
*  I was living in this row house right next to the train, the A train. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1543.2199999999998s)]
*  And then my partner Peter would start visiting more. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1548.2199999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, are we dating? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1551.2199999999998s)]
*  Are we not? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1553.2199999999998s)]
*  Like, what is happening? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1554.2199999999998s)]
*  I'm living with your grandmother. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1555.2199999999998s)]
*  But it was kind of beautiful that we didn't name it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1557.2199999999998s)]
*  It just came over. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1560.2199999999998s)]
*  Just what was happening. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1561.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1562.2199999999998s)]
*  He's like, I think we're just together, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1563.2199999999998s)]
*  Let's just try it out. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1565.2199999999998s)]
*  And I lived in his mother's childhood room down the hall from her. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1567.82s)]
*  And it was a foundational experience in my life. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1574.82s)]
*  So you had the experience of being a caregiver for her. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1579.82s)]
*  And I think also for your mom when your mom was dying from cancer. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1583.82s)]
*  What did you learn about caregiving? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1588.82s)]
*  Or what did it teach you? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1591.82s)]
*  Because I think until we've gone through it, we can look at it almost as like a [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1592.82s)]
*  personality or something that's solely to be endured without any other positive qualities. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1596.82s)]
*  But what was your experience? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1602.82s)]
*  It certainly requires endurance because you are in a heightened place of selflessness [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1605.82s)]
*  and giving with no determinate end. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1615.82s)]
*  And so there's a kind of faith of the act itself. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1619.82s)]
*  Like I'm like, I'm just going to be here for as long as it takes. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1624.82s)]
*  But in a way, it's really sad because it should also be what is possible without illness. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1629.82s)]
*  Giving your loved one your best self. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1638.82s)]
*  But then only when death nears do we truly do it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1642.82s)]
*  Maybe because it's unsustainable otherwise. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1646.82s)]
*  It's not a world away from the idea you said earlier of kindness without hope. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1650.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think so. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1653.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1655.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1658.82s)]
*  Because there is no hope. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1660.82s)]
*  You just want to almost merge with them. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1662.82s)]
*  Like when I'm on my mother's deathbed, I said, Mom, anything, anything. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1664.82s)]
*  And often she's just very political. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1668.82s)]
*  She just kept saying, like, raise me up. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1671.82s)]
*  And we have this hospice bed. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1674.82s)]
*  I'm like, Mom, it's the highest it can go. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1676.82s)]
*  She's like, yeah, but keep raising me up. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1678.82s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, and I just like, as a poet, all I can think about is the metaphor. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1682.82s)]
*  I'm like, raise you up where? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1686.82s)]
*  You know, are you going up there? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1688.82s)]
*  And so it was, it changed everything for me. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1691.82s)]
*  You know, everyone says that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1696.82s)]
*  But I think death becomes, it's just always here. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1698.82s)]
*  Do you think it changed the kind of writer you are? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1702.82s)]
*  I don't know yet. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1707.82s)]
*  This is the first book I wrote from start to finish without her being alive. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1709.82s)]
*  And I told myself, like any young writer, that I was this avant-garde, counter-formalist. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1714.82s)]
*  And I saw myself on this kind of high horse. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1722.82s)]
*  And I thought, I write whatever I want. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1726.82s)]
*  And I was very proud of that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1728.82s)]
*  But I realized after my mother passed that I was actually just trying to do well in the world so that I could take care of my mom. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1730.82s)]
*  Like everything was kind of a strategic, right? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1738.82s)]
*  It's like, oh, I got to get this job. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1740.82s)]
*  I got to be a professor. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1742.82s)]
*  I got to get tenure now. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1743.82s)]
*  I got to do service work. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1745.82s)]
*  And I just secure my family because, you know, I have one salary. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1746.82s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1751.82s)]
*  But even now, there's nine Vietnamese refugees who I take care of. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1752.82s)]
*  It's a blessing. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1757.82s)]
*  I don't see it as a burden. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1758.82s)]
*  You mean who you support financially? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1759.82s)]
*  I support financially, yeah. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1761.82s)]
*  I mean, but I was always strategic. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1762.82s)]
*  And when my mom died, I was like, that was it. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1764.82s)]
*  It was everything was for her. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1766.82s)]
*  I have a job. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1767.82s)]
*  You know, I have a living. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1769.82s)]
*  And ultimately, I got to ask a question I didn't want to ask yet, but I had to, which was what would I write for myself? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1771.82s)]
*  And this is the toughest book I wrote. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1781.82s)]
*  And not like formally, but just existentially. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1784.82s)]
*  It's like, okay, now what? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1788.82s)]
*  Just write a book to say some things? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1790.82s)]
*  And I felt that for a long time. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1792.82s)]
*  And I told my agent, I'm sorry I had a time. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1794.82s)]
*  I think this is my slump book. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1797.82s)]
*  You know, I just knew one. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1799.82s)]
*  Yeah, I felt that way. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1800.82s)]
*  It just and I still feel that way. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1802.82s)]
*  I just because I don't know the culture will decide, you know, but I just felt like I have what did you feel like you weren't accomplishing? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1804.82s)]
*  It wasn't clear to me why anyone should read it. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1810.82s)]
*  You know, like and I think that's part of like the question of, oh, if I wrote for myself, then I'm like, oh, I don't think anyone should read it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1813.82s)]
*  I wrote for myself. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1819.82s)]
*  Whereas if I wrote to support my family, it was very clear. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1822.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1826.82s)]
*  It was like, here's a book from a son to a mother who can't read. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1827.82s)]
*  That's wham. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1830.82s)]
*  You know, let's go take off. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1831.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1833.82s)]
*  Writing for yourself seemed selfish or hollow. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1834.82s)]
*  It felt just very neutral. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1837.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1839.82s)]
*  You know, it just it just felt very limp where I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm excited. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1840.82s)]
*  I it's a creative work. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1846.82s)]
*  When I lost that myth and it is a myth, right, I made that myth. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1848.82s)]
*  I made the myth of like I need to go. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1853.82s)]
*  It's that quintessential oldest immigrant son myth, except that other people said, I'm going to be a doctor, a lawyer. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1856.82s)]
*  But I said, I'm going to be a writer, the best writer I can be to take care of my family. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1862.82s)]
*  And I was like, even as I tried to betray that Asian stereotype of like the immigrant making good. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1868.82s)]
*  And I thought I would be like this radical writer. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1877.82s)]
*  I end up doing it. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1881.82s)]
*  You took a different path, but you did it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1883.82s)]
*  It was the same thing. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1885.82s)]
*  It's the same goal. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1886.82s)]
*  And so when I finally got to do what I thought I was doing this whole time, which is like writing on my own terms, it felt really empty to me. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1888.82s)]
*  But I'm not I don't fetishize an identity of writer. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1897.82s)]
*  To me, this what we're doing is the same work. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1903.82s)]
*  My teaching is the same work. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1906.82s)]
*  When I give a talk at a university in front of people, it's the same thing. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1908.82s)]
*  How do you characterize that work? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1912.82s)]
*  A kind of sincerity of figuring this out. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1914.82s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1918.82s)]
*  In the Buddhist Sutra, it says, engage the phenomena of the world with earnestness. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1920.82s)]
*  And I've always valued that. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1927.82s)]
*  I just didn't know that our culture often values cynicism as a form of intelligence. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1929.82s)]
*  And earnestness is kind of frowned upon because it almost means that you've been duped. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1935.82s)]
*  It's like, oh, you believe in this too much. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1940.82s)]
*  You've clearly haven't thought deeply about it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1942.82s)]
*  Well, also, it just, you know, for better or worse, it turns out that cynicism wins a lot of times. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1944.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1950.82s)]
*  Earnestness isn't always rewarded. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1951.82s)]
*  I know the point is not to be rewarded for earnestness, but it is easy to be skeptical about it when you see how the spoils are divided. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1953.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1961.82s)]
*  And earnestness and sincerity is overcommitting, right? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1962.82s)]
*  Because you have to go all in. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1965.82s)]
*  You have to have hope, optimism. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1967.82s)]
*  But the cynic gets to stay in the neutral line and judge the ones who go forward. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1969.82s)]
*  So it's an easier position to be in. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1974.82s)]
*  And there's very low risk of it. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1976.82s)]
*  After the break, I talked to Ocean again, and he tells me how falling in love with literature was sometimes a wedge between him and his family. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1983.82s)]
*  Where I'm from, reading itself is almost a betrayal. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1991.82s)]
*  It's a class betrayal. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1995.82s)]
*  It was kind of seen as like, oh, you're too good for us. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=1997.82s)]
*  You're trying to read to go to college. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2000.82s)]
*  You're trying too hard to get out. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2002.82s)]
*  Hi, Ocean. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2013.82s)]
*  How are you? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2040.82s)]
*  Hi again. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2041.82s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2042.82s)]
*  Glad to talk to you again. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2043.82s)]
*  I must say, before we start, there is some drilling happening in my New York apartment. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2044.82s)]
*  So if you hear whining, painful sound, I promise it's not coming from my voice. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2049.8199999999997s)]
*  Are you ready for some more lighthearted questions about you and your work? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2057.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm ready. I'm ready. Always. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2062.8199999999997s)]
*  So I know that your mom had a sense of your accomplishments as a writer. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2066.82s)]
*  I think I read maybe an interview you gave or a piece you wrote where you talked about how she came to readings of yours and sort of enjoyed the fact that a bunch of white people were sitting and listening respectfully to her son. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2072.82s)]
*  But do you know if anyone ever, I mean, she was illiterate. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2087.82s)]
*  So do you know if anyone ever read your work to her? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2090.82s)]
*  Did she have responses to the content of your work, not just the reception of it? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2093.82s)]
*  No, you know, I tried to kind of like break down a poem for her. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2097.82s)]
*  I tried to even talk to her about books I want to write. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2102.82s)]
*  And I think it was hard for her ultimately to be in proximity of my reading and writing because it was almost like I was evidence of what she was writing. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2107.82s)]
*  I was evidence of what she could have done if she had a normal life untouched by war. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2122.82s)]
*  And when I realized that very early on, I stopped reading in front of her because it was almost like this mocking. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2129.82s)]
*  It's like I'm proud of my son, but gosh, he's in a world I'll never access. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2137.82s)]
*  And I put the books away after I realized that. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2143.82s)]
*  Because also where I'm from, reading itself is almost a betrayal. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2147.82s)]
*  It's a class betrayal. It was kind of seen as like, oh, you're too good for us. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2152.82s)]
*  You're trying to read to go to college. You're trying too hard to get out. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2156.82s)]
*  And in the same way, it's like I remember when I first started reading in high school, I'll go to the library or the lunchroom and read and I would hide. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2161.82s)]
*  I would pretend to be asleep. I would put my head down on my hand and put the book in my lap. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2170.82s)]
*  And it felt so natural. Like, oh yeah, I got to do. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2176.82s)]
*  But in retrospect, it was so interesting but deeply sad that it was better for me to perform lethargy and unconsciousness. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2179.82s)]
*  It was better to perform unconsciousness than to read and be perceived reading. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2190.82s)]
*  I'm still stunned by that, you know, but it just that was how you have to do it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2198.82s)]
*  If you wanted to read, you had to find a way. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2202.82s)]
*  How do you think becoming more educated and changing your social milieu also affected your relationships with people? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2205.82s)]
*  David, I still don't understand it because I've met so few people who've gone through it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2216.82s)]
*  I tried to explain this to my mother and my aunt, the kind of loneliness of class movement. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2225.82s)]
*  It takes so long to study and realize what has happened to you. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2235.82s)]
*  You know, and I think of this in relation to Mark Fisher's work, who writes brilliantly about this as a theorist. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2242.82s)]
*  He says, like, you know, coming from the working poor and takes decades of learning to realize what happened to you. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2249.82s)]
*  And by the time you realize it, it's too late. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2257.82s)]
*  Like right now, my grandma's dead, my uncle's dead, my mom's dead. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2260.82s)]
*  You know, it's almost like there's a kind of helplessness to that realization. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2264.82s)]
*  And so I think I've kind of come to an end of understanding all that, but it feels too late. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2269.82s)]
*  I think it's a lot of grief. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2277.82s)]
*  You know, you enter these rooms and even with my colleagues, they're all lovely. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2279.82s)]
*  But it's hard to explain what we were talking about in our first interview. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2284.82s)]
*  Like, I don't I never say that stuff because I feel like it's going to stop the room or people are going to. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2290.82s)]
*  I just feel like I'm always kind of really alone in these spaces. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2295.82s)]
*  And then when I come home, no one cares. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2301.82s)]
*  What do you mean no one cares? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2304.82s)]
*  Like two years ago, I was bailing out my cousin, like truly bailing him out in a bail bond office. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2306.82s)]
*  Who's having a mental health crisis? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2312.82s)]
*  It was really bad. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2314.82s)]
*  And police were being called. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2315.82s)]
*  And I get a call from my aunt saying it's like 1 a.m. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2317.82s)]
*  Come to this 24 hour bail bond. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2321.82s)]
*  And I go and I've never bailed anybody out. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2323.82s)]
*  And I'm like, MacArthur genius? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2326.82s)]
*  Who cares? New Yorker? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2329.82s)]
*  None of that had any traction. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2331.82s)]
*  I don't even know how to fill out a bail bond form. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2333.82s)]
*  And I'm just like completely lost. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2336.82s)]
*  Nobody cares what I do. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2338.82s)]
*  And I think in a way that's refreshing. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2340.82s)]
*  Like I don't come home as Ocean Vong, the writer. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2342.82s)]
*  I come home as Ocean the nephew, the cousin, the cousin who's going to bail me out, the cousin who's going to buy my new Yeezys that I saw online, you know, whatever. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2345.82s)]
*  So it's refreshing. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2357.82s)]
*  So it's refreshing. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2358.82s)]
*  But there's no place that I'm recognized as a person other than like my close circle of friends who are also mostly not writers. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2359.82s)]
*  And, you know, if I were to think about it further, David, like philosophically, I would maybe even push to say maybe none of us have a place. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2368.82s)]
*  You know, like how much are we performing? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2376.82s)]
*  We talk to our mother differently. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2379.82s)]
*  We talk to our dean differently. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2381.82s)]
*  We talk to our friends, our lovers. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2383.82s)]
*  We're constantly code switching. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2386.82s)]
*  And one thing I'm interested in as a writer is like, is there a center to me? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2388.82s)]
*  Is there a center to you? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2392.82s)]
*  Or are we just a matrix of instances? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2394.82s)]
*  You know, it gets really heady. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2398.82s)]
*  But on some days I feel like, all right, I am who I am. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2400.82s)]
*  And some days I'm like, I think I'm just a series of utterances. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2403.82s)]
*  But you don't want to go down that route too much. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2408.82s)]
*  You might have to call your therapist. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2411.82s)]
*  You had said earlier that you financially support nine refugees. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2415.82s)]
*  These are family members. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2420.82s)]
*  Family members. I mean, technically they're Vietnamese refugees. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2421.82s)]
*  That's how we arrived. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2424.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2425.82s)]
*  Are they worried about their status in the country? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2426.82s)]
*  Are you worried about it? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2429.82s)]
*  I am. Right. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2430.82s)]
*  I mean, every day has been a nail biter. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2431.82s)]
*  And I'm in kind of survival mode for them. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2434.82s)]
*  And I just said, just please just put your head down. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2437.82s)]
*  It's so crazy, David, because I've said in the past, I said, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2440.82s)]
*  our elders put their heads down so that the next generation can be known, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2445.82s)]
*  can do what they want. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2450.82s)]
*  I don't have to be a doctor or a lawyer. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2452.82s)]
*  You know, I can be a poet. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2454.82s)]
*  But here I am, the second generation or the 1.5 or whatever, telling my elders, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2456.82s)]
*  please put your head down. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2463.82s)]
*  Please just go to work. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2464.82s)]
*  Don't get a speeding ticket until further notice. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2466.82s)]
*  But the suspicion has always been there, you know, of government, of power. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2469.82s)]
*  And I think this is true with a lot of Vietnamese refugees and refugees in general. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2476.82s)]
*  In a lot of ways, it hurt us because the suspicion also applied to doctors. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2483.82s)]
*  You know, my grandmother never wanted to see a doctor until it was too late. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2489.82s)]
*  And it was stage four. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2493.82s)]
*  My mother was afraid of doctors, missed her mammogram appointment by six months. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2495.82s)]
*  And I said, why did you, you know, she said, oh, I just I get nervous going in there, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2502.82s)]
*  you know, even when I go with her. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2507.82s)]
*  So that applies that kind of trust in authority. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2509.82s)]
*  It's a fraught thing. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2514.82s)]
*  And it's hard to choose how you respond to your trauma. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2516.82s)]
*  Do you think there's any way in which sort of your awareness of the cruelty that you had [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2521.82s)]
*  inside yourself and your own experience with cruelty gives you any understanding of the strain [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2526.82s)]
*  of our culture currently in which cruelty seems like it's almost become fashionable? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2534.82s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2540.82s)]
*  But there's almost like a performative cruelty that happens. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2542.82s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2545.82s)]
*  I think I was in a world where anger, rage and violence was a way to control the environment. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2546.82s)]
*  And it was a way to control an environment for people who had no control of their lives. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2555.82s)]
*  A lot of them were hurt and wounded. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2561.82s)]
*  You know, like another memory I had was I think about this often. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2563.82s)]
*  It's just seeing a kid get jumped for the first time. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2566.82s)]
*  I was maybe 12, 13. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2569.82s)]
*  And it was a kid called D Nice. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2571.82s)]
*  And I remember like a group of like 15, 20 kids. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2573.82s)]
*  It was so many of all ages. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2579.82s)]
*  And they went up behind him, pulled his shirt over his head, and then they just went in. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2581.82s)]
*  Just a flurry of this. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2587.82s)]
*  But I think because so much of that was close to me, I always had to look at it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2589.82s)]
*  And it behooved me to understand it in order to survive. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2596.82s)]
*  So when I see cruelty, I look closer and I say, where is this coming from? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2601.82s)]
*  And a lot of times it comes from fear and vulnerability. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2606.82s)]
*  You know, you're too scared and you have to strike first. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2610.82s)]
*  Which is a form of controlling the situation. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2613.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2615.82s)]
*  And so in a way, I have great compassion for that because the doorway through violence has always been suffering. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2616.82s)]
*  I've never seen anyone commit violence and feel joy after. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2623.82s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2629.82s)]
*  You see the doorway in front of you and it feels so immense. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2630.82s)]
*  It feels like the only path. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2635.82s)]
*  But when you step back, if I can borrow a metaphor here, it's almost like the doorway is in the middle of a field. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2637.82s)]
*  And you're like, oh my goodness. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2643.82s)]
*  I can step back and I can just take one step to the side and go around. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2645.82s)]
*  And the whole world is before me. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2650.82s)]
*  And there was a threshold in front of me that I could always pass through after that day with Big Joe. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2652.82s)]
*  In a way, my career so far has been a slow attempt at stepping back and stepping aside from that door. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2658.82s)]
*  I was curious. Did you ever get your stolen bike back? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2666.82s)]
*  I didn't get it back to get my bonus. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2671.82s)]
*  But I didn't make it to work. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2675.82s)]
*  You know, I still think about the feeling of that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2677.82s)]
*  And I just think, why did I rage out that day? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2680.82s)]
*  And I think it was just that all that hope was robbed from me. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2684.82s)]
*  I think that was what it was. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2689.82s)]
*  I felt entitled to that bonus. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2692.82s)]
*  And when someone else took that out of me, I think I lost sense of control. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2695.82s)]
*  I think about that. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2701.82s)]
*  You have these epiphanies when you're just kind of in a helpless state. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2702.82s)]
*  You brought up the concept of Satori a couple times. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2711.82s)]
*  Have you had any epiphanic moments of Satori recently? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2716.82s)]
*  I have this particular one. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2723.82s)]
*  And I felt kind of crazy. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2726.82s)]
*  But I started asking my friends about it. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2730.82s)]
*  And a lot of them actually share it. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2732.82s)]
*  And it's usually in the middle of the night. I can't sleep. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2734.82s)]
*  I wake up in a kind of terror. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2736.82s)]
*  It's almost like this moment before a true awareness arrives. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2739.82s)]
*  There's about like a 15-second window of, oh my God, what is all this? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2745.82s)]
*  And what fills that is this kind of horror that none of it matters. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2753.82s)]
*  We're all going to die. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2760.82s)]
*  Why am I here? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2762.82s)]
*  Why am I sitting in this apartment scribbling away when I should be trying to be a better partner? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2763.82s)]
*  I want to apologize to everybody I've ever known. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2770.82s)]
*  I want to redeem myself for everything. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2773.82s)]
*  And I'm going to commit my life to trying to heal and help everybody I love. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2776.82s)]
*  And that lasts maybe like three minutes. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2782.82s)]
*  And then I pick up my phone and scroll on something. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2784.82s)]
*  And then the culture just supplants it all. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2788.82s)]
*  And so the trick of satari is to commit that realization into action. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2791.82s)]
*  And I have a lot of trouble in the second assignment. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2797.82s)]
*  But that strange existential horror, I think maybe because when my mother was on her deathbed, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2800.82s)]
*  she says, son, now that you know how painful this is, you have to go and help people. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2808.82s)]
*  And it was like a mandate. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2818.82s)]
*  But I just thought, gosh, here's a woman taking her last breath. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2821.82s)]
*  She's not like, I don't want to romanticize her and make her some sort of martyr. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2826.82s)]
*  But where did that come from? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2831.82s)]
*  This idea that you have to then tell your son to go help people. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2834.82s)]
*  You know, and here we go again. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2840.82s)]
*  I'm still trying to find out all the ways that I could do that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2844.82s)]
*  You can't just make your art for yourself in a vacuum. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2850.82s)]
*  I mean, there's diaries and journals for that. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2854.82s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2856.82s)]
*  But when you make art to share, you have to think, how can I be amongst people? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2857.82s)]
*  My favorite theorist, Trinity Minha, said it best. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2863.82s)]
*  She said, I do not write about. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2867.82s)]
*  I write beside. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2869.82s)]
*  Gosh, that's so perfect. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2872.82s)]
*  If I could do that my whole life, I would have a successful life as an artist, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2874.82s)]
*  regardless of what happens. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2878.82s)]
*  I never think I'm writing about something. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2880.82s)]
*  I don't want to render the people around me into a meaningful nugget. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2882.82s)]
*  I want to just scribble alongside. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2887.82s)]
*  That feels truer. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2891.82s)]
*  That's Ocean Vuong. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2897.82s)]
*  His new book, The Emperor of Gladness, will be published on May 13th. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2899.82s)]

*  Now, she's got to figure out how to make it popular [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2951.82s)]
*  with a new generation of users. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2954.82s)]
*  I think the reason Gen Z has abandoned the apps [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2956.82s)]
*  is because they're getting on the apps [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2959.82s)]
*  and they're not seeing who they want to see. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2961.82s)]
*  And they're feeling two things. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2963.82s)]
*  They're feeling rejected. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2965.82s)]
*  And they're feeling judged. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAlDAm74jE8&t=2967.82s)]
