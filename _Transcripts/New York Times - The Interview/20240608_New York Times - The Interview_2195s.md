# 'The Interview': The Darker Side of Julia Louis-Dreyfus
**New York Times - The Interview:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=0.0s)]
*  At some point in almost every performance she gives, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has this look. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=9.76s)]
*  If you've watched Seinfeld, the New Adventures of Old Christine or Vi, you definitely know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=16.42s)]
*  it. It's that perfect mix of irritation and defiance. Like she's saying, try me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  That spikiness has always felt revelatory to me, especially three decades ago, when [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=28.54s)]
*  Julia was first putting these kinds of women on our screens. In recent years, she's been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=33.86s)]
*  moving in new, more introspective directions, but still pushing against conventional wisdom [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=38.9s)]
*  about women. That's especially true on her wonderful hit podcast, Wiser Than Me, where [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  she interviews older female celebrities. She's also doing more movies, including two independent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=49.86s)]
*  films with the writer and director Nicole Holofssoner about the struggles of middle [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=55.48s)]
*  age. And she's got a recurring role in the Marvel cinematic universe. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=59.72s)]
*  Her newest movie is called Tuesday. It's directed by Dinah O. Pusich, and in it she plays a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=64.74s)]
*  mother whose teenage daughter has a terminal illness. It's a surreal, dark fairy tale. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=70.74s)]
*  One of the main characters is a CGI parrot who represents death. And as she told me, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  she was nervous about taking it on. Clearly, even in her sixties, Julia is not done challenging [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=82.62s)]
*  herself and those of us watching her. Here's my conversation with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=88.84s)]
*  Hi, Lulu. How are you? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=94.84s)]
*  I'm great. How are you? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=99.72s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=101.0s)]
*  I have a lot of questions about the new movie, but it's a pretty heavy film. So I just want [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=102.0s)]
*  to warm up a little with some other questions before we get into that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Am I right that you're in a new Marvel film at the moment? It must be a very different [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=112.24s)]
*  kind of set to be on. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=115.86s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=117.46s)]
*  What's it like when you're actually on set? I mean, is it as sort of manic as it might [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=119.82s)]
*  seem? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=124.06s)]
*  No, it's not manic at all. It's very well organized. It's very methodical. And I don't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=125.06s)]
*  mean that in a negative way. Particularly on this film, they're very much focused on, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=133.26s)]
*  frankly, the human story, believe it or not. And I think they're trying to sort of go back [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=139.04s)]
*  to their roots, as it were, for real. And so there's a lot of focus on that. They're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=146.6s)]
*  trying to stay away from as much, I guess you call it CGI or whatever, as possible so [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=152.78s)]
*  that the stunts are like everywhere. And in fact, I had to do a couple, which I loved. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=159.66s)]
*  What stunts have you been doing? And what's that been like? Because you don't normally [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=167.1s)]
*  do movies with stunts. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, I've been in movies with stunts, but not in really once I've performed. And this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=171.4s)]
*  and by the way, I'm making this out to sound like I'm like, flying through the air like, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=176.64s)]
*  you know, Captain America or whatever, but I'm not. So it's just a very, very, very, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=183.0s)]
*  very brief stunt. It's practically nothing. So I don't want to. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=188.72s)]
*  You're not doing a Tom Cruise like flying over a canyon? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=192.6s)]
*  No, I'm not on the motorcycle jumping off a cliff. But even the little bit that I did [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  do took a few days of rehearsal. And it's gobs of fun. In fact, the only thing I don't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=202.82s)]
*  like is being away from home. But other than that, it's really been a very happy experience. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=209.8s)]
*  And not kidding. It's wild to witness it. For example, I'll just say one other quick [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=215.5s)]
*  thing on set. Now, one of the two editors is on set and is doing a rough edit as we're [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=220.14s)]
*  shooting. And the reason for this is so that it's ultimately if you have the budget to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=228.55999999999997s)]
*  do that, you have to have a certain budget to be able to do that. But ultimately, I think [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  it's a financial savings because then in the moment on the day, it's like putting pieces [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  of a puzzle together to get these things right. And if you realize you need that angle [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=244.76s)]
*  of this hand coming in from that direction, you can get it on the day as opposed to trying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=250.42s)]
*  to reshoot it or realizing in the edit room six weeks later. So it's a wild amount of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=256.42s)]
*  detail and attention. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you have complicated feelings about what the superhero franchises have done to films [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=265.4s)]
*  in general? Because when you've chosen to do films lately, they've been sort of smaller [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  films, there have been more intimate films, and then you have these massive franchises [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=278.94s)]
*  that have taken over in so many ways. So I'm just wondering how you look at that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  I look at it gratefully. I mean, I don't look, there's no guarantee that just because a movie [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=291.06s)]
*  is in a franchise, it's going to work. There's scores of examples exactly that. And even [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=298.86s)]
*  in the Marvel universe, they've had some clunkers. So I'm not sure that the size of a franchise [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=305.22s)]
*  is the problem with the entertainment business. I do believe that the corporations eating [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=313.56s)]
*  up corporations eating up corporations may be more of the problem, but not the franchise [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=319.5s)]
*  itself, if that makes sense. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=324.76s)]
*  You mean the consolidation in the industry with less competition and therefore... [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=326.46s)]
*  Yeah, and lots of cooks and lots of people with opinions. And so the idea of a new idea [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  or an independent idea or an outside the box idea is harder to sell, to make, it seems. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=337.46s)]
*  Well I guess that dovetails really nicely. Let's talk about Tuesday, your new film, because [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=348.34s)]
*  that is exactly sort of the opposite. It is a small film. You play the mother of a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=353.86s)]
*  terminally ill teenager, but this is also a fantasy film in that death is portrayed [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  by a talking parrot. Why did you want to do this film? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=366.38s)]
*  Well I read the script and I was immediately intrigued by it because it was so unusual. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=371.5s)]
*  And the themes of the film captivated my imagination. And that is to say loss and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=381.04s)]
*  grief and motherhood and denial and death and dying. All of that is interesting to me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=389.04s)]
*  And I feel that this way of exploring these themes using magical realism to tell the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=401.18s)]
*  story. I'm not going to lie, I was nervous about it because it's very strange. And I [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=409.82s)]
*  met Dinah a couple of times and we talked a great length because I wanted to really [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=418.5s)]
*  get a sense of her and could I give my heart to her and trust her because if this didn't [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=423.92s)]
*  work, if this really fell flat, if this bird that's in the movie who's played brilliantly [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  by Arins A. Kenya, if that doesn't work, we've got a real problem. And so I needed to talk [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  to her very seriously about her intention and her vision. And I fell in love with her [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=445.12s)]
*  and the story and took this leap of faith, which it was. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, in preparation for this and after watching the film, we had a lot of discussion [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=455.48s)]
*  about the parrot and how to describe the parrot and what the parrot is. It's an unusual device [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  in this movie. And not to get sort of all college English seminar on you, but no, God, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=467.48s)]
*  I won't be able to answer. But how do you when you were coming to this and you were [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=472.76s)]
*  having these discussions, what did you sort of see its meaning to be in the film? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=476.6s)]
*  I saw for me personally, and it doesn't mean this is for everyone because you can [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=483.72s)]
*  interpret this any way you like. But for me, he was my death doula. He was my guide for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=488.96s)]
*  me, my character. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  That's a really great analogy, because in the film, he leads you through these various [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  stages of dealing with the death of your daughter. And I have to say, as a mother myself, it [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=506.32s)]
*  was pretty hard to watch. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=513.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, even talking about it as I can feel it. It's hard to even talk about. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=515.6s)]
*  Yeah. You said that you were interested in exploring these ideas. Can you tell me why? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  Sure. Well, they're fundamental. It's funny how we're all going to die. And everyone we [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=528.88s)]
*  know is going to die. We're all going to die. And yet we do not waste any time really [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=537.28s)]
*  thinking about that. And I probably shouldn't use the word waste. But we don't think about [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=542.68s)]
*  it a lot. And that's maybe it's a good thing. But it is amazing because we all have that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  in common. And it's not something you go through life considering a lot. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=556.52s)]
*  I've lost people very close to me in my life, and those losses are hard to reconcile. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=565.0s)]
*  Still are. I've given birth to two children. And I don't want to be misunderstood, but [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=573.16s)]
*  there's something about giving birth and the awesomeness of that. And then when my father [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=581.16s)]
*  died and I was with him when he died, there is a similar thing, the waiting. And I was [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=588.16s)]
*  struck by how similar that was in certain ways to waiting for a baby to come. And it [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=599.12s)]
*  has a mystery to it that is undeniable, as does the birth of a person. And I myself had [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=609.36s)]
*  cancer now many years ago. But even so, the idea of that sort of coming to knock on your [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=619.52s)]
*  door was like alarming, shall we say, which is the understatement of the century. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=627.92s)]
*  But did it give you a different relationship with your own mortality? I mean, you described [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=635.28s)]
*  it as something knocking on your door. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  It did. Not that I thought I'm leaving, that I'm going to die from this. Then I wouldn't [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  allow myself to think it. But it was right here chirping in my ear. And I don't have a [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=649.76s)]
*  an arrogant sense of my immortality anymore. I don't the way you do when you're 20. I don't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=658.08s)]
*  feel like that anymore. I feel a little more present. And I feel a little more grateful. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=665.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know from other cancer survivors that it can fundamentally change your idea of how [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  to live your life. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  Totally. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=678.64s)]
*  In a good way. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=681.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I have so much to celebrate. And I feel an enormous sense of gratitude. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=682.4s)]
*  In this film, you have this scene where you say to your daughter, I don't know who I am [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=694.6s)]
*  without you, what the world is without you in it. And I have to say it's a devastating [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=702.36s)]
*  line because I think any parent just knows how unimaginable it is to experience the loss [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=708.08s)]
*  of a child. How did you, while you were making this film, experience that yourself? I mean, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  what were you tapping into? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=722.76s)]
*  Stuff I didn't want to tap into. So I, you know, I don't want to sound too actory. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  Please sound actory. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=733.12s)]
*  No, I don't like that. But I was on location. We shot this in London. So I was not with my [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=734.36s)]
*  family. And those few days that we shot the pivotal scenes in the movie, I had to call home a [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=741.48s)]
*  lot. I really was a tad unhinged. It was a hard place to go in my mind. And even though it's [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=750.2s)]
*  pretend, and I recognize that, and I'm not in any way implying that it's not pretend, you do have [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=761.32s)]
*  to flirt emotionally with stuff in a very real way to give authenticity to a performance. And it [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=771.48s)]
*  was a hard thing to do. It was a hard thing to do. It was a hard thing to recover from after. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what I had to call home a lot. That was a hard time. Let's just put it that way. It was [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=785.6s)]
*  hard. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=790.4s)]
*  So I'm gonna shift out of the movie just for a moment, because it is painful, I think. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  Wait, before you do, can I ask you a quick question? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=801.6s)]
*  I love your name. Is your real name Lulu? Or is that a nickname? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  So my real name is Lourdes, because I'm Hispanic, Lourdes. But I've always been Lulu [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=807.12s)]
*  since I was born. It's a very common nickname. I'm Cuban. And so I've always been Lulu. And so [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=812.72s)]
*  that's who I am. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=818.8s)]
*  Well, lucky you, Lulu. I love it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=819.7199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. One of the messages, of course, in the film is not only that death is necessary, but [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=822.16s)]
*  that it can be beautiful, that it actually isn't something necessarily to be afraid of. And I [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=828.88s)]
*  recently heard an episode of your podcast, Wiser Than Me, where you interviewed Patti Smith, and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=833.68s)]
*  you talked about the different ways that you've processed the death of people in your own life. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=838.5999999999999s)]
*  Have the conversations you've been having on your podcast helped you process the sort of many [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=845.72s)]
*  ways, the surprising ways in which people just deal with the hard things in their life? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=851.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's really one of the many impetuses to making this pot. What is the plural of impetus? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=859.0400000000001s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=867.4s)]
*  Empathie. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=868.32s)]
*  Empathie. It's one of the empathie. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  That sounds wrong. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=872.6800000000001s)]
*  Let's use it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=873.6s)]
*  To having these conversations on the podcast, because all of these women that I'm talking to [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=874.84s)]
*  have really lived very full, long lives. And that, of course, means they've experienced loss. And [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm really interested to talk to them about how they move beyond it, or with it, or into it, or [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=892.6s)]
*  I mean, I'm just loving to have those conversations. And I want to hear from these women who [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  have experienced an enormous amount of life. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=909.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I find what's comforting about them, and sometimes a little depressing, is that how [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=914.96s)]
*  many of the same themes, right, sexism, prejudice, self-doubt, they have experienced themselves. And [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=921.56s)]
*  I'm wondering, what is your takeaway from hearing these women having gone through so many of the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=930.72s)]
*  things that we're still going through now? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=936.04s)]
*  There's a sense with most of them, not everybody, but there's a sense of, okay, I'm done with that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=941.52s)]
*  bullshit. I don't know if we can swear on your podcast. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=948.28s)]
*  You can swear. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, I'm done with that. I'm done with self-doubt. I'm done with shame. I'm done with [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  feeling weird about being ambitious. You know, the list is long. I don't, and we all know what it [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=959.8s)]
*  is. I think, for me, the takeaway is, oh, we can be done with that sooner than we thought. We don't [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  have to take 60, 70 fucking years to come to that conclusion. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  What have you applied? What are you done with? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=976.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm done with, I'm working on being done with self-doubt. I'm working on being done with [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=980.0s)]
*  shame. And I'm working really hard on finding joy, finding joy. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=992.68s)]
*  I like the way you paused and really kind of thought about your wording because you said, I'm [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1002.12s)]
*  done with, and then you said, I'm working on being done with. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1008.2s)]
*  Well, I haven't accomplished all of this yet. I mean, I'm still, you know, old habits die hard. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1011.12s)]
*  And I have a stronger sense of strength now than I did when I was 30 or 20. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1018.92s)]
*  I feel like there's still room to grow. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1029.56s)]
*  I want to just note one more thing about your podcast, which is that your mom appears on the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1034.84s)]
*  podcast. And you've talked about going to therapy with her when you were 60 and she was 87. Okay, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1038.8s)]
*  talk me through why she agreed to this, because I've laid my differences with my mom, who's 85, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1046.48s)]
*  sort of aside. I figure she's that age and she isn't going to change. But maybe I'm thinking [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1052.76s)]
*  about this wrong. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1057.8s)]
*  I went to therapy with my mother because she said something to me. It might have been my dad's [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1060.92s)]
*  birthday, my dad who had passed. And she was remembering that it was his birthday. And she [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1068.2s)]
*  said something about, I'm sure you're talking about your dad's birthday. And she said, I'm [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1075.72s)]
*  sure you're thinking about your dad. And I know there was stuff there that I wish we'd been able [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1082.2s)]
*  to deal with or talk about when you were younger, you know, because my parents were divorced. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1087.8s)]
*  Wish we could, we'd had had a chance to do that. And I said, Oh, well, mom, what's keeping us? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1095.24s)]
*  Why don't we do it? And so off we went and we did it. And it was very, very helpful. It's not like, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1100.28s)]
*  you know, everything becomes perfect, but that's not possible under any circumstances. But it was an [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1107.56s)]
*  opportunity to communicate in maybe a more honest way and in a safe way that was helpful to both of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1117.0s)]
*  us. And I have no regrets about it. So if you're thinking about it with your mom, and if you think [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1126.28s)]
*  your mother would be into it, I encourage you to do it because you might not have the opportunity [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1133.4s)]
*  in 10 years. And you might think, Oh, if only. Did it heal things, unresolved things? Did you see her [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1140.3600000000001s)]
*  differently after that? Yes. I know I'm asking you a lot of personal questions. And because I [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1147.88s)]
*  assume you're going to charge me after this. I am. Yeah. But it's because you've been very open on [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1157.4s)]
*  your podcast. I know. Huge mistake. Do you feel that? Well, I know it's weird because I don't know, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1164.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't really, I have, it's, I've never done anything like this. I think it's, it sort of [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1173.0s)]
*  surprises me a little bit. I'm incredibly private point of fact. I mean, I really am. So it is sort [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1177.72s)]
*  of a strange thing, but I also don't think that I've, I don't have any regrets about what I've [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1183.48s)]
*  shared on the podcast, but it is new territory for me. But I don't know. It's also good. I think it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1188.52s)]
*  engenders a way of thinking about communication that might be good. All right. Let's get out of [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1195.88s)]
*  the heavy stuff. I want to ask you about being funny. So you've had these 10 poll roles, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1201.88s)]
*  Seinfeld, the new adventures of old Christine Veep. Would you do another long running TV [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1207.32s)]
*  series? Are you open to that now? Yes, I am. I am. What is it about that kind of episodic thing [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1213.24s)]
*  where you really develop a character over years that you like? God, it's so much fun. You know, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1220.1200000000001s)]
*  if you get the right group of people together, it's like holy water. It's so magnificent. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1227.08s)]
*  It's like a team sport. It's team play and it just doesn't get better than that. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a lot. It's a treadmill though. I will say, you know, I mean, it is absolutely a treadmill [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1243.1599999999999s)]
*  and it's an enormous amount of work to keep doing that and keep up what is hopefully a level of [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1248.36s)]
*  excellence over a long period of time. So there are built in challenges. So maybe a limited series [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1254.6s)]
*  might be a little more doable right now because to get locked into an eight year run on something [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1263.48s)]
*  might be a little daunting, but people aren't doing that anymore anyway. You know, everything [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1269.56s)]
*  is much shorter lived, it seems entertainment wise. Thinking about Seinfeld and just how things [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1273.32s)]
*  are made now, could Seinfeld be made now? Probably not. I mean, what the hell's happening in network [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1278.9199999999998s)]
*  television anymore? I mean, you know, when Seinfeld was made, it was really unlike anything that was [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1286.52s)]
*  on at the time. It was a very different style of comedy and style of storytelling and a different [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1293.48s)]
*  premise. It was just a bunch of losers hanging out. I mean, it wasn't like a family or even a [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1300.28s)]
*  workplace comedy. I'm not suggesting the other is bad. I'm just saying it was very different. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1307.72s)]
*  So I would say one main reason it wouldn't be made now is because it's hard to get anything [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1313.8s)]
*  different recognized. And particularly nowadays, everyone's sort of running scared, it seems, you [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1319.56s)]
*  know. Although I will say actually, I say this and then I will also say that like at 824 where this [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1326.4399999999998s)]
*  movie was made, they are not scared of different. Are you worried about where Hollywood's at right [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1332.52s)]
*  now? A little bit. I am a little bit. I hope, I mean, people need to be entertained. People like [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1339.08s)]
*  to be entertained. So it's not like I feel it's not going to disappear, but it's going through [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1345.96s)]
*  a transition. I don't know how it's going to end up. So one of the things that I was thinking, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1351.24s)]
*  though, when I was looking at your characters on these long running series, Selena Meyer on V, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1357.3999999999999s)]
*  Belayne on Seinfeld, even Zora the character on Tuesday, they're often not very likeable people. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1363.24s)]
*  Is it fun to play people that act in unsympathetic ways? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1371.24s)]
*  It is. I love that. Why? Because it's so interesting. I don't know. I like an anti-hero. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1378.84s)]
*  Also, isn't that what people, nobody's, nothing is pure. Nobody's pure. Everyone's makes horrible [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1386.1200000000001s)]
*  mistakes and fails. And I think that's more interesting. And I think conflict is more [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1394.52s)]
*  interesting. And I think it's funnier. When you say it's funnier, obviously conflict is [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1401.24s)]
*  a great source of comedy. But I guess what I'm asking you is that, is there an unlikable part [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1405.96s)]
*  of you that you bring? And I'm just wondering if there, I can't believe I just asked you that. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1411.96s)]
*  Yeah. Wouldn't it be funny if as you said that, like horns came up out of my head and my tongue [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1419.0s)]
*  rolled out and it was like a spiked tongue. Am I, yes, I am unlikable. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1423.48s)]
*  Not that you're unlikable. I think you're lovely. What I'm saying is, for example, I think that [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1434.3600000000001s)]
*  and I am quite proud of this. I'm a pretty prickly person. So I guess that's what I'm asking. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1441.96s)]
*  Is it because maybe you think you're too nice in real life that you've drawn to these characters, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1447.48s)]
*  or maybe that's part of you too, that you're a sort of maybe difficult person and you are [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1451.0s)]
*  drawn to them because that kind of exemplifies something about yourself? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1455.08s)]
*  Well, I don't think I'm a difficult person. I wonder what other people would say. I am [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1459.4s)]
*  an opinionated person and I have strong opinions and strong instincts. And I think you're awful, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1466.52s)]
*  Thank you, Julia. You're a prickly bitch is what you are. No, but anyway, I really do, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1480.84s)]
*  I am not like these people I play, but I am interested, I guess, in some aspect of myself [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1488.92s)]
*  that like, for example, with Selena Meyer, she was essentially two years old and thought that the [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1496.76s)]
*  world revolved around her and any mistakes she made was simply not her own. It was somebody else's. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1504.28s)]
*  And that's a fun ego thing to tap into, to not consider anyone else around you other than [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1510.2s)]
*  yourself. And what does that mean? What does that mean? When somebody does that, it means they [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1519.16s)]
*  obviously they haven't been well nurtured, that goes without saying, but it's also an incredibly [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1524.92s)]
*  funny place to start with a character. You know, talking about Veep, it does make me wonder [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1530.3600000000001s)]
*  about how hard it is nowadays to be funny about politics. And you are very political, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1540.04s)]
*  you even hosted the DNC in 2020. One of the things that people say that they like about Trump is [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1546.6s)]
*  that he's funny. And maybe they mean that he's entertaining in a shocking and irreverent way. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1552.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm looking at your face. You clearly don't think that he's funny. No. But one thing that people do [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1558.6s)]
*  say on the other side about the Democratic Party is that it's become too puritanical. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1565.64s)]
*  Your former co-star Jerry Seinfeld recently made news for talking about political correctness and [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1571.48s)]
*  comedy. And so I'm just wondering, as a famous comedian yourself, what you think about that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1575.88s)]
*  I think that if you look back on comedy and drama both, let's say 30 years ago, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1583.0800000000002s)]
*  through the lens of today, you might find bits and pieces that don't age well. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1590.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think to have antenna about sensitivities is not a bad thing. And it doesn't mean that all [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1599.56s)]
*  comedy goes out the window as a result. When I hear people starting to complain about political [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1607.72s)]
*  correctness, and I understand why people might push back on it, but to me that's a red flag, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1614.68s)]
*  because sometimes it means something else. I believe being aware of certain sensitivities [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1622.92s)]
*  is not a bad thing. I don't know how else to say it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1631.16s)]
*  Are there things that no longer feel funny to you that once did, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1635.56s)]
*  or things that are funny now that you didn't notice before? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1638.68s)]
*  Uh, oh, that's a good question. We're going to have to revisit that question, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1644.3600000000001s)]
*  because I don't know quite how to answer it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1651.64s)]
*  Well, we are going to speak again. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1656.1200000000001s)]
*  In our next session, doctor, we'll discuss it then, because I'm not sure. I have to think [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1659.32s)]
*  about that. I want to be thoughtful about it. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1665.08s)]
*  After the break, I called Julia back to get her answer to that last question. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1667.32s)]
*  And we also talk about taking big swings in comedy. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1671.48s)]
*  There's enormous risk. Look, you're going to fail. You're going to fail. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  And in order to be very funny, you have to take huge risks. And sometimes those risks [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1679.96s)]
*  really pay off. And sometimes they truly do not. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1686.36s)]
*  Hi, this is Lulu. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1697.32s)]
*  Well, hello, Lulu. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1713.0s)]
*  Where are you? What are you doing? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1714.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm in Georgia right now. I'm shooting the Marvel movie here. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1717.24s)]
*  We talked about the Marvel movie. So you're actually down there doing your thing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1722.52s)]
*  I am indeed. Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1727.3999999999999s)]
*  So I was wondering if you'd been thinking about anything from our previous conversation. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1729.32s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to make sure that I answered this whole idea of political correctness correctly. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1737.0s)]
*  And I can't really remember what I just said. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1743.0s)]
*  So I sort of wanted to go back to that and be sort of very clear about where I stand. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1745.96s)]
*  My feeling about all of it is that political correctness, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1752.84s)]
*  I mean, insofar as it equates to tolerance, is obviously fantastic. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1756.9199999999998s)]
*  And of course, I reserve the right to boo anyone who says anything that offends me [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1762.12s)]
*  while also respecting their right to free speech. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1768.4399999999998s)]
*  Right? But the bigger problem, and I think the true threat to art and the creation of art, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1772.36s)]
*  is the consolidation of money and power. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1779.32s)]
*  All this sidling of studios and outlets and streamers and distributors, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1783.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's good for the creative voice. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1790.28s)]
*  So that's what I want to say in terms of the threat to art. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1792.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was also thinking more about what you said and having brought up Jerry [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1797.8s)]
*  Seinfeld and his comments about comedy. And my intention wasn't to put you on the spot, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1803.0s)]
*  but more to understand how you think about risk taking in comedy. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  There's enormous risk. Look, you're going to fail. You're going to fail. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1812.12s)]
*  In order to be very funny, you have to take huge risks. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1817.08s)]
*  And sometimes those risks really pay off. And sometimes they truly do not. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1820.9199999999998s)]
*  And you have failed miserably. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1828.9199999999998s)]
*  But that's the joy and the tragedy of doing anything funny. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1832.92s)]
*  You said, though, that last time it wasn't a bad thing to have sensitivity in comedy. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1844.12s)]
*  Do you think it makes comedy better that people are now more tuned to [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1849.96s)]
*  how some of their comments might be received? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1854.68s)]
*  I don't know. I can't judge that if it's better or not. I just know that, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1858.12s)]
*  the lens through which we create art today, and I'm not going to just specify it to comedy. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1862.52s)]
*  I think it's also drama. It's a different lens. It really is. And I think even classically wonderful, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1868.76s)]
*  indisputably great films from the past are riddled with attitudes that today would not be [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1877.48s)]
*  acceptable. So I think it's just good to be vigilant. Even I was thinking about this, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1886.36s)]
*  I thought, well, pretend this show, your show, the interview was being made 40 years ago. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1892.84s)]
*  I would posit that diversity would not be something you would be considering in terms of [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1900.6799999999998s)]
*  the guests that you would bring to the show. So that's interesting, isn't it? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1906.9199999999998s)]
*  Things have shifted. And in that case, I would say things have shifted very much for the good. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1912.2s)]
*  And also, actually, Lulu, probably you wouldn't be the host. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1918.6799999999998s)]
*  I think, Julia, you're probably right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1922.84s)]
*  So I think we have to sort of keep working to make it better, warts and all. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1926.28s)]
*  So what I was thinking about our previous conversation was a moment where I asked you [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1935.0s)]
*  about unlikability. And I was thinking that I used the wrong word. What I was trying to get at [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1941.9599999999998s)]
*  was how I've always admired, and this is the word that I would use now, the sharp edges that you [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1948.6799999999998s)]
*  bring to your characters. Does that description ring a little bit more true to you? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1955.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't play good girls. I don't play girls that behave a way that a good girl should behave. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1961.5600000000002s)]
*  Or if they do, they do it with bitterness and anxiety. So I've played a lot of characters who [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1969.72s)]
*  push back on the position that they're in, that are not content with their [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1979.64s)]
*  place in the world. And I would say that women are having their rights taken away. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1989.3200000000002s)]
*  And women are not content. And I play women like that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=1996.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you think you're still trying to prove yourself? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2004.28s)]
*  Always, yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2006.92s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2007.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. Like on Tuesday in this movie coming out, I'm certain nobody would have considered me for [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2009.16s)]
*  that role 20 years ago or something. And that's probably because they just thought of me only as [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2017.1599999999999s)]
*  a ha-ha funny person. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2025.24s)]
*  We left our last call on a question you wanted to think some more about. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2029.8799999999999s)]
*  So have you had any thoughts about how your sense of humor has changed or not over the years? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2034.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, sorry, I forgot to think about it. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2040.28s)]
*  I need to do my homework. Oh my God, Lulu. I'm so sorry. Please, please let me pass. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2052.6s)]
*  I don't know. I think my working sense of humor, that is to say what I bring to my performance, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2062.52s)]
*  I think that that's probably gotten better. I've been in the presence of so many people from whom [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2068.52s)]
*  through osmosis and watching them work, I have learned things about physical comedy, about [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2075.0s)]
*  the nuance of comedy, about the smallness of comedy. But there's always room to learn more. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2081.64s)]
*  And for me, that is an incredibly joyful adventure. That's my like last minute [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2090.04s)]
*  procrastinating cliff notey answer. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2096.2s)]
*  That's Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Tuesday will be in theaters nationwide starting June 14th. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU&t=2106.52s)]
