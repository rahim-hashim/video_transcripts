# John Oliver on Presidential Debates
**New York Times - The Interview:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ)
*  You know, we are in this very contentious political moment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And one of the things that I noticed was that you have said you've never wanted to cover a debate on your show. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=4.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=10.32s)]
*  Is that still true? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=11.24s)]
*  Even though President Biden had this unbelievable debate in June that caused the race to upend itself, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=12.8s)]
*  and the most recent debate with Kamala Harris and Trump, I mean, they've been pretty consequential. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=19.68s)]
*  Biden-Trump debate was pretty consequential because Biden isn't the nominee anymore. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=23.6s)]
*  So it'd be hard to push back on that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=27.44s)]
*  I guess it's very hard to say how consequential it is in real time, isn't it? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=33.68s)]
*  Also, those debates tend to be pretty uninspiring to me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=35.12s)]
*  As a form of entertainment, yeah, you could definitely be entertained by what happened. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=39.12s)]
*  However much better it felt to watch it, it is pretty depressing that it's this close. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=44.72s)]
*  That's, I guess, my aftertaste from it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBuLooumwQ&t=51.84s)]
