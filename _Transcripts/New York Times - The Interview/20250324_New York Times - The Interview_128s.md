# The Challenges of Narcissistic Parents
**New York Times - The Interview:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg)
*  I'm curious about the idea of whether self-identifying as the child of an emotionally immature parent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=0.0s)]
*  might lead to feelings of victimhood. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=9.76s)]
*  Is there any risk in self-identifying as a child of emotionally immature parents and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=14.22s)]
*  then feeling disempowered or a lack of agency in your own life and in how you manage your [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=20.76s)]
*  emotions? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=29.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's exactly the opposite. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=30.54s)]
*  And I think it really increases a person's sense of agency. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=34.54s)]
*  Because what's really disempowering to them is the idea that I've been trying to interact [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=39.06s)]
*  with my parent using all the communication skills I know, using all the tact or the empathy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=47.26s)]
*  that I know. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=53.22s)]
*  And it doesn't go anywhere and we end up in a fight. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=55.1s)]
*  So they feel the whole basis of a relationship with an emotionally immature person is that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=60.22s)]
*  you often feel disempowered because they can't give either you or them the room to have you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=66.46s)]
*  be understood. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=73.7s)]
*  And when you realize that the reason that they're not listening or the reason that they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=75.18s)]
*  don't seem to be responding to you is not because you have poor communication skills. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=81.62s)]
*  It's because they can't stand it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  They can't bear to be even mildly criticized. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  They don't have the emotional wherewithal to deal with that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=97.04s)]
*  And when you realize that, it's like, oh, this is not about my lack of skill or the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=102.44s)]
*  fact that I get nervous around my parents. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=112.36s)]
*  That's not the deal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  And if I understand what's happening, I can change my behavior or I can change my responses [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=117.8s)]
*  because I understand what they're doing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_R54i0_Nkg&t=125.24s)]
