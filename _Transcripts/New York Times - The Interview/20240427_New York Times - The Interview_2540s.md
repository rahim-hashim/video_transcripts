# Anne Hathaway Is Done Trying to Please
**New York Times - The Interview:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A)
*  This is The Interview, a new show from the New York Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=7.2s)]
*  On one level, Anne Hathaway's new movie, The Idea of You, couldn't be more straightforward. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=11.96s)]
*  It's an adaptation of a novel about a woman who winds up in a relationship with a much [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=17.36s)]
*  younger singer in a boy band. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=21.14s)]
*  The movie's an update of the kinds of movies that Hathaway was known for earlier in her [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=22.96s)]
*  movies like The Princess Diaries and The Devil Wears Prada. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  These were movies where young women find themselves in entirely new situations and have to adapt [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=31.64s)]
*  to high pressure and glamorous worlds. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  The twist for the new movie, though, is that Hathaway's playing a 40-year-old divorced [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=38.72s)]
*  mom, so she's coming in a little less starry-eyed about the whole thing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=42.92s)]
*  But The Idea of You also works on another, more complicated, I think you could even say [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  meta level. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  It's a movie about women pushing against societal expectations of them and getting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  hate for it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=57.3s)]
*  And that is something Hathaway knows a bit about. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=58.3s)]
*  A decade ago, around the time she won an Oscar for Les Miserables, the internet turned on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=61.9s)]
*  Anne Hathaway. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=66.62s)]
*  People decided, inexplicably, that she was an inauthentic striver or something like that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=68.0s)]
*  And the unfair backlash earned a nickname of its own, Hatha-hate, you might remember [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=73.3s)]
*  it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=78.1s)]
*  And it makes even less sense to me now than it did then. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=79.1s)]
*  But as Hathaway told me, for her the past decade has been about letting go of people's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=82.22s)]
*  opinions and expectations, including those of interviewers like me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  But that hasn't made her any less fun to talk to. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=89.86s)]
*  In some ways, it's made her more interesting than ever. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=93.33999999999999s)]
*  And I think a great guest for my first episode. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  Here's my interview with Anne Hathaway. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  Hi guys. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=105.58s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=106.94s)]
*  I'm David. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=107.94s)]
*  Nice to meet you, David. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=108.94s)]
*  I'm Annie. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=109.94s)]
*  So there are a bunch of things that are intriguing to me about the new movie. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=111.38s)]
*  One of which is, I think, in kind of an interesting way that there are a few little, what I took [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=116.98s)]
*  to be like Anne Hathaway's psychological Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the film. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=123.14s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=128.18s)]
*  I'll get to those. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=129.18s)]
*  But first, you haven't done a romance in really kind of a while. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=130.74s)]
*  I think it was, you know, since the days of One Day and Love and Other Drugs, more than [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=134.7s)]
*  10 years ago now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=140.5s)]
*  So just to start, can you talk to me about why you wanted to do this movie? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=141.74s)]
*  It's such a softball question and I can feel my brain complicating it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  No, I want you to go as complicated as you can make it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=152.02s)]
*  Sorry, everybody. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=155.86s)]
*  I'm still, if you can believe it, after all of these years, I always still find it so [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=156.86s)]
*  much more natural to express my thoughts and my feelings through characters and through [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  the story. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=166.18s)]
*  So a part of me just wants to be like, well, just see the movie. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=167.48s)]
*  That's why I wanted to make it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=170.28s)]
*  But then I realized that I should probably be able to describe it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  So this is a movie about a woman healing her heart after a massive trust trauma. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=174.64s)]
*  And it says that a bloom can happen in a person's life at any stage. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=184.04s)]
*  And I really found myself almost possessed with the need to explore what those two things [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=191.48s)]
*  meant and looked like. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=199.56s)]
*  So I'm now curious about kind of the nature of that possession that you just described. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  Was it about like an abstract level or did you find it connected to something about you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=206.78s)]
*  in a more direct way? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=213.1s)]
*  Oh, it was completely direct. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=214.56s)]
*  So tell me about that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=216.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=217.48s)]
*  It was totally direct. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=218.48s)]
*  I think that my character, Solene Marchand, she might not seem like, I don't know, the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=219.48s)]
*  most complicated character I've ever played. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=224.56s)]
*  There's no accents. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=226.92s)]
*  There's no particular gait. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=228.2s)]
*  I love a character's gait. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  But what she had going for her, she felt familiar. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  She felt like people I know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=237.72s)]
*  I recognized aspects of myself in her. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=238.92s)]
*  I recognize aspects of my friends or women I admire. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=241.44s)]
*  My friends are women I admire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=244.44s)]
*  That sounded awful. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=245.56s)]
*  But the thing about her was she had a richness to her, which combined with this idea that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=247.84s)]
*  early in her life she'd been a people pleaser. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=253.28s)]
*  I was so excited by that idea of somebody arriving at a place in their life where they've [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=255.68s)]
*  grown out of that phase. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=260.0s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought up that people pleaser line because that was one of the Easter eggs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=263.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  A people pleaser from New Jersey. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=271.08s)]
*  But before I get into that, you know my vote for best Anne Hathaway character gait? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=272.46s)]
*  Dark Knight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=278.58s)]
*  Thank you very, very much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=279.58s)]
*  So much swagger. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=280.58s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=281.58s)]
*  I worked with a choreographer for three weeks to find that swagger. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=282.58s)]
*  So really? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=286.06s)]
*  Yes, I did because I just felt like I didn't have an, oh, this is going to sound like a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=287.06s)]
*  really rude sentence, but I wasn't connected enough to my hips. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  And I just kept imagining, you know, a cat's movements and the way it's very fluid and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=297.34s)]
*  swishy and but also very strong and very purposeful. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=301.54s)]
*  And we, they helped me find my hips. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=305.38s)]
*  I think you need to introduce me to that choreographer because not being connected enough to my hips [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=308.62s)]
*  I think describes most of my life problems for the last 42 years, but maybe she can help. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=313.14s)]
*  We are going to follow up because I have so many thoughts because I didn't feel connected [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=318.58s)]
*  to my body early on in my life. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=324.42s)]
*  And it was kind of this weird thing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=326.08s)]
*  Like you don't know how to do it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=327.38s)]
*  And that's something that it's this amazing gift that acting has given me is that you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=328.78s)]
*  always have to think about how you move, how your character moves. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=333.58s)]
*  And eventually you just kind of get to understand movement. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=337.5s)]
*  Why weren't you connected to your body? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=341.9s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=344.38s)]
*  And we don't have, I mean, it would take me 41 years to answer that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=345.74s)]
*  It's genuinely so many things, but I think I probably just needed, I think it's just [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=351.34s)]
*  assumed that we have a relationship with a buddy like you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=356.54s)]
*  Like you, you, you, like something, you know, about yourself is that you do not have a relationship [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=359.18s)]
*  with your hips. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=362.86s)]
*  Not a good one. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=364.26000000000005s)]
*  But if somebody said, here's a path for you to have one, what would you do? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=366.42s)]
*  That is, Oh boy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=372.3s)]
*  I don't know how to answer that question. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=373.42s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=375.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=376.54s)]
*  But I want to go back to the people pleaser line. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=377.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=381.54s)]
*  the inclusion of the line, a people pleaser from New Jersey as pretty intentional. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=383.02000000000004s)]
*  Can you talk to me about why that line is in there? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, she had to be from somewhere. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  And yeah, so I think it might've been me who suggested that line. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=396.5s)]
*  Maybe possibly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=400.22s)]
*  Am I wrong in interpreting that line self referentially? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=401.94s)]
*  Like you are a people pleaser from New Jersey, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  I think I'm a former people pleaser from New Jersey. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=409.62s)]
*  I, yeah, I think I absolutely was. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=412.62s)]
*  I absolutely was. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=416.58s)]
*  It was again, to me, so much of the reason why I was drawn to acting was because it was [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=417.58s)]
*  an outlet for expression that I could not find on my own. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=422.38s)]
*  And sort of in the space between feeling so connected when I was acting and so lost when [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=427.02s)]
*  I wasn't, you sort of try to make your way. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=433.74s)]
*  And one of the ways that you make your way is like, oh, if I do this and that'll make [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=437.82s)]
*  someone else happy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=441.42s)]
*  And maybe that's what I'm supposed to be doing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=442.74s)]
*  And it takes a really long time to go, well, it doesn't really matter if you don't know [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  who you are. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=449.18s)]
*  Unless you just want an identity that's all about pleasing people, which I suppose is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=450.34s)]
*  perfectly valid as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=454.32s)]
*  But I'm not that nice. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm curious about when that shift from people pleaser to former people pleaser started to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  happen because it was interesting for me to revisit a lot of your work and see in a bunch [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=468.54s)]
*  of roles what I took to be kind of, and I don't mean this in a condescending way at [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  all, but sort of like an eager beaver quality. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm thinking of things like, you know, the devil wears Prada or in some ways Princess [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=486.18s)]
*  Diaries or I think your character in Valentine's Day had that sort of, or in a slightly spikier [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=492.38s)]
*  way, maybe the intern had that, you know. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=498.18s)]
*  So I'm interested in knowing about how that quality might have affected the work you did [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=500.96s)]
*  at a certain part of your career. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=507.74s)]
*  And if that was something you consciously then tried to change. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=510.06s)]
*  I was not aware of it until this conversation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=515.62s)]
*  But yeah, I do think that there's a thread that runs through those characters about someone [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=518.74s)]
*  who is trying to do something that they might not be altogether comfortable with, but they [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=527.58s)]
*  think is the right thing to do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=532.12s)]
*  And the thing that I was so interested about Solenne was this idea that, you know, turning [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=534.5400000000001s)]
*  40 and knowing who she was, definitely in a professional sense, definitely knowing who [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=539.82s)]
*  she is as a mother, but not necessarily having given herself full freight to explore aspects [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=543.74s)]
*  of herself just as a person. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=549.86s)]
*  You just referenced another key emotional through line of the film, which is the entering [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=553.02s)]
*  middle age aspect. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=559.0600000000001s)]
*  And obviously 40 years old is a real milestone for a lot of people, a lot of women. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=561.34s)]
*  But there's also something weird about our cultural fixation on the arbitrary age of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=570.3s)]
*  40 years old. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=576.8599999999999s)]
*  And I'm just curious how you think about entering middle age, given that it is a, or can be [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  a fraught thing, particularly for people in your line of work, but also understanding [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=587.3s)]
*  that it is kind of a somewhat arbitrary fixation for people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=592.0999999999999s)]
*  So serious. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=600.06s)]
*  I'm not, I don't take it that seriously. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=601.06s)]
*  I got to be honest. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=603.9s)]
*  There are so many other things that I identify as milestones. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=606.7399999999999s)]
*  I don't normally talk about it, but I am over five years sober. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=610.02s)]
*  That feels like a milestone to me. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=617.04s)]
*  40 feels like a gift. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=618.8599999999999s)]
*  The fact of the matter is like, I hesitate at calling things middle age simply because [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=621.78s)]
*  I'm really, I can be a little bit of a semantic stickler and technically I could get hit by [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=628.22s)]
*  a car later today. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=633.54s)]
*  I really hope it doesn't happen. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=634.54s)]
*  And so we don't know if this is middle age. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=636.72s)]
*  We don't know anything. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=640.16s)]
*  So I like to connect to it in that way. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=641.56s)]
*  I don't think this is breaking news. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=645.5s)]
*  I'm a nerd. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=646.86s)]
*  So I love learning. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=648.02s)]
*  I am so into learning. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  And I just kind of like, I don't know. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=652.34s)]
*  That's what I focus on. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=657.34s)]
*  I just focus on, oh my God, I get to learn something today, hopefully. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=658.34s)]
*  You know what you said about the semantics of using the term middle aged when we don't [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=661.98s)]
*  really know or we can't know actually where in our lifespan we are. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=667.38s)]
*  You know, this made me sound totally like a new agey ding dong, but I think- [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=673.02s)]
*  Get there, go there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=677.34s)]
*  Come on, let's go. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  Let's bring it out. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  Where are your crystals? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=680.4200000000001s)]
*  I've got incense burning on my side. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=681.4200000000001s)]
*  Let's do this. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=682.64s)]
*  What you said is exactly right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=686.6s)]
*  We can't take for granted how much life we have left, but actually internalizing that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=689.04s)]
*  so that we can treat each day and moment like it could be the last, which would be the most [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=696.4s)]
*  powerful change we could make in our lives, is also maybe the hardest thing to actually [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=701.64s)]
*  do. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=707.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=708.28s)]
*  Well, one of the things that I think about a lot is because I lived in a stressful place [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=709.28s)]
*  for many years and when you talk about those performances, a key element to all of them, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=714.26s)]
*  I think, is that they're really stressed out young women. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=719.58s)]
*  And I was a really stressed out young woman. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=723.1s)]
*  And as a formerly chronically stressed young woman, which leads to all manner of things, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=726.0s)]
*  I just remember thinking one day, you are taking this for granted. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=733.66s)]
*  You are taking your life for granted. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=739.26s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=741.14s)]
*  Everything could fall through the sky and that would be lights out for you. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=742.98s)]
*  So when I find myself like the old instincts rising, I just tell myself, I'm like, you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=745.4s)]
*  are not going to die stressed. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  It's a small question, but maybe invites a big answer. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=753.46s)]
*  What were you so stressed about? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=757.78s)]
*  I didn't know how to breathe yet. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=763.62s)]
*  And that was really complicated. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=766.94s)]
*  That was really, really complicated, not knowing how to breathe. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=769.5s)]
*  You're right. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=773.8199999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  It's actually too big an answer. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=775.8199999999999s)]
*  And the simple answer is just like literally everything. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  Because I was stressed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=780.14s)]
*  I was just very, very, very in my head about a lot of things. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=784.6999999999999s)]
*  I guess maybe that's the easiest way to put it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=788.6999999999999s)]
*  It's interesting that your first answer to that question was about breathing. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=791.98s)]
*  And earlier you alluded to not feeling comfortable in your body. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=796.52s)]
*  Those are two somatic things. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=802.12s)]
*  You must have felt very alienated from your body. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=805.08s)]
*  I love that you just identified it as somatic. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=808.88s)]
*  I think it feels a little too exposed to discuss the alienation I felt from my body. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=811.6s)]
*  But I think there was a lot of somatic stress there. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=819.84s)]
*  Was drinking a way of dealing with that? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=825.84s)]
*  Probably. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=830.0s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=831.88s)]
*  Let me ask you a goofier question now. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=832.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=835.96s)]
*  And then I'm going to circle back to have yourself again. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=836.96s)]
*  The plot of the film turns on a trip to Coachella. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=840.88s)]
*  Have you ever been to the festival? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=845.68s)]
*  I have been to Coachella. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=847.44s)]
*  Tell me about your experiences there. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=849.32s)]
*  Paul McCartney was the headliner, so it was magical. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=851.36s)]
*  You just go and you see these acts and you're just kind of like drifting in and out of waves [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=855.04s)]
*  of people and it's a fun thing to do. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=860.2s)]
*  I feel like everybody should go and kind of have their own experience. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=863.24s)]
*  I don't know, it's probably very different now. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=866.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  I think I went the same year that Paul McCartney was. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=868.9200000000001s)]
*  That was probably 2000, I would guess, 10 or 12. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=871.32s)]
*  Nine-ish, 10? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=874.24s)]
*  Yeah, something like. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=875.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=876.24s)]
*  Can I tell you a very quick Coachella story? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=877.24s)]
*  It can even be long. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=880.36s)]
*  I don't want to take up our short time with a long Coachella story. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=881.36s)]
*  But I used to work for music magazines. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  We used to have to go and cover this stuff. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=888.92s)]
*  One year it was too hot, I didn't have enough water. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=891.64s)]
*  I was drinking beer all day, taking other stuff. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=894.84s)]
*  And really by the end of the day, I was so fried and physically uncomfortable. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=898.92s)]
*  You were so tweaked out. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=903.0s)]
*  Oh no, that's a bad combination. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=905.04s)]
*  I got to get out of here. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=907.16s)]
*  We had a plan that at 1130 we'd all meet in the press area and then someone would drive [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=909.28s)]
*  us back to our hotel. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=914.54s)]
*  But I thought, I can't wait till then, I just got to get out of here. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=915.54s)]
*  I thought, I'll walk back to our hotel. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=918.4s)]
*  This is the state of mind I was in. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=920.8s)]
*  Probably the hotel was like. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=922.4s)]
*  Oh my God, you thought you were going to walk back? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=923.6s)]
*  No. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  15 miles or whatever in the desert at night. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=926.9599999999999s)]
*  So I just left the festival and within about 10 minutes I realized I'm lost in the desert. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=929.12s)]
*  I'm so stressed and worried for you right now. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  No cars are coming by, I don't know where I am, my mind is totally foggy. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=937.72s)]
*  I thought somehow I'm going to die on the highway trying to walk back to my hotel. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=942.56s)]
*  And then after some period of time a car pulls up and it's my coworkers come to save [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=947.76s)]
*  me. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=953.04s)]
*  They rescued you. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=954.04s)]
*  I get in the car and I was like, oh thank God, I've been here forever, I didn't know [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=955.04s)]
*  what I was going to do. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=958.64s)]
*  And then he looks at the clock and then looks behind him. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=960.08s)]
*  Literally like 22 minutes had passed. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=965.3199999999999s)]
*  I was like an eighth of a mile away from the, I was not at risk of dying. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  What did it felt to you, those 22 minutes? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=975.64s)]
*  Longest 22 minutes of my life. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=977.48s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=979.24s)]
*  Well, I'm so happy everything went okay. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=980.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=982.72s)]
*  But yeah, no, Coachella is very dehydrating. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=983.72s)]
*  Very dehydrating, yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=988.16s)]
*  I feel like I have sort of danced around this question a couple of times, but to me the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=990.76s)]
*  most interesting thing about people is when they change, when they were one thing and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=995.52s)]
*  they become another thing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1001.16s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can tell me a little more about the change that I think I'm hearing [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1004.16s)]
*  in you sort of implicitly from kind of like a stressed out, knotted up person who's in [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1011.88s)]
*  you in your words, in her own head to the person you are now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1019.84s)]
*  Change is certainly a word that applies. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1028.56s)]
*  Another word is, I don't like this word because I think it's often misunderstood so maybe [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1031.48s)]
*  I shouldn't even say it, but I'd love to explore it with you if you want to explore it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1035.4s)]
*  Settles. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1038.8400000000001s)]
*  I think settling often has a negative connotation, but actually like to me when settle becomes [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1040.4s)]
*  beautiful is like that concept of surrender. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1049.64s)]
*  And I think gratitude is really crucial to it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1053.68s)]
*  And I don't want to go into specifics too much just because I like to keep my personal [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1056.4s)]
*  things personal, but there was a moment in my life where, I don't know, do you ever [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1060.44s)]
*  have this feeling where you feel like you have yourself in the future, like your best [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1070.0s)]
*  possible choice turn around and guide you? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1075.64s)]
*  Now I'm sounding very New Age. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  Explain to me more what you mean. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, I was just stuck in this feeling and I've been stuck in a feeling for a while and [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  it's that thing about I want to achieve things. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1086.96s)]
*  I want to grow. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1090.16s)]
*  I want to do these things. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1091.16s)]
*  And I think you think mistakenly that the way that you do that is really hard on yourself. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1092.16s)]
*  And you drive yourself by self-criticism, by telling yourself you're not enough. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1100.04s)]
*  And I just I won't go into the specifics of it, but there was a moment in which I just [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  realized that in order to keep that narrative alive, I was going to have to deny so much. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1110.04s)]
*  And there was just something about that. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1117.16s)]
*  There's something about me being aware that in order to keep up this narrative, which, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1118.68s)]
*  by the way, I didn't feel like I was improving anymore. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1122.64s)]
*  I feel like I strongly strongly plateaued. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1124.44s)]
*  And I just said, you're going to have to accept, you're just going to have to accept that if [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1128.68s)]
*  nothing else happens to you, you've had a really great life. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  And it felt like, I don't know, it just felt like a light one on. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  You know what else is something that I find interesting is not the right word, but a realization [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1144.36s)]
*  I had about sort of motivating yourself through negativity is that you never get to the bottom [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1151.9199999999998s)]
*  of it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1157.36s)]
*  You know, it's like you can just keep getting more and more negative. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1158.36s)]
*  And it's not like you ever hit some rock bottom or like, OK, now I can be pot. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1160.52s)]
*  It's an endless. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1166.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1167.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  That resonates. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  You described yourself as a person who wants to achieve things. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1171.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1174.28s)]
*  What are the things that you want to achieve? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1175.28s)]
*  What are the ambitions now? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1176.74s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable getting too specific. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1179.64s)]
*  I think it just comes from being raised in a superstitious household. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1182.76s)]
*  I think that, again, I feel, I don't know, honestly, I don't really want to say because [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1187.4s)]
*  I just feel like they feel great to me. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1195.72s)]
*  And I worry if I shared them and they got shredded. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1200.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to feel bad about them. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1204.92s)]
*  I actually feel really great about them. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1205.92s)]
*  But I just think that just acknowledging that you are someone who is ambitious, acknowledging [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1209.08s)]
*  that you are someone who, yeah, I do want to achieve things. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1213.92s)]
*  But I'd say that my ambition right now is to do all of that and really, really be a [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1216.96s)]
*  nurturing presence in people's lives as well. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1223.12s)]
*  This is another one of the potential Easter eggs or sort of self referential lines that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1226.72s)]
*  I thought I picked up in the film. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1232.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1234.08s)]
*  And the reason I'm thinking about it now is because when I asked you about ambitions, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1235.08s)]
*  you said you don't necessarily want to put it out there because if it got shredded, it [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1239.0s)]
*  would make you feel bad about it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1241.44s)]
*  And there are a couple points in the film where there are references to your character [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1245.24s)]
*  being picked apart on the Internet. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1251.84s)]
*  And did your experience going through that, you know, a decade plus ago, inform the character? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1255.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1263.96s)]
*  Can you tell me in what ways? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1264.96s)]
*  Not really. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1267.44s)]
*  It's in the film. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1268.44s)]
*  How fooey. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1271.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1272.44s)]
*  Just, just, just look, what I can tell you is that from personal experience, I knew that [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1273.44s)]
*  everything we were saying was true. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1279.28s)]
*  You know, it happens. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1282.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1283.04s)]
*  I can't believe I just on the record said fooey. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1284.04s)]
*  Fooey. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1287.04s)]
*  Oh. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1288.04s)]
*  Fooey. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1289.04s)]
*  Oh, bluggernsdun. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1290.04s)]
*  I just read this great, great, great list of common Victorian expressions that are so [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1291.04s)]
*  literal and filthy. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1304.56s)]
*  And I can only think of one right now that I couldn't possibly say. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1306.88s)]
*  Wait, tell me off the record, off the record. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  Off the record? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1313.0s)]
*  BLEEP. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1314.0s)]
*  That's filthy. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1321.0s)]
*  So we're back on the record now. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1323.76s)]
*  And for the record, we laughed heartily. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1325.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1328.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1329.36s)]
*  Anne Hathaway said a very inappropriate thing. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1330.36s)]
*  It was the Victorians. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1331.36s)]
*  I was simply, I was just repeating Victorian slang. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1332.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1336.56s)]
*  It was a conversation furthering the idea of semantics. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1337.56s)]
*  That's such a funny way of putting it, excuse me. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1340.56s)]
*  So clearly at a couple different times in this conversation, I've tried to create a [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1347.6s)]
*  through line or an arc to your career. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1352.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, where I was saying, it seemed like you did this here or like this happened at [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1355.84s)]
*  this point and how does that sort of affect things now? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1359.24s)]
*  Do you see a through line or a particular arc to your career? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1362.76s)]
*  I'm not terribly reflective. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1370.28s)]
*  I like to look towards the horizon that's coming at me rather than look back at what [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1373.52s)]
*  I've done. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1379.08s)]
*  Like I don't watch my films. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1380.08s)]
*  I'm not sitting around having marathons. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1381.6s)]
*  It's so sweet. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1384.64s)]
*  I get texts from friends and from people and like, like I was just on a plane the other [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1385.64s)]
*  And they were like, Oh my God, I watched Devil Wears Prada last night. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  And so like people, I know I love that. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1394.48s)]
*  So many of my movies are the films that you cuddle up with. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1396.6s)]
*  You know, and I do know that I do. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1400.12s)]
*  I'm aware of that aspect of it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1401.3999999999999s)]
*  But in terms of like the concept of having, first of all, the concept of having a name [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1403.04s)]
*  is so weird. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1407.04s)]
*  A name that people recognize. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1408.04s)]
*  It's like, I always think about the least likely things that could happen to you as [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1409.44s)]
*  an actor. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1412.04s)]
*  And one of them is that you have a name that people actually know. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1413.04s)]
*  So the idea of having a name that signifies something that could qualify as having an [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1415.3999999999999s)]
*  Easter egg. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1419.2s)]
*  It's just, it's, it's no, it's, that's not a concept that I think about a lot. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1420.2s)]
*  I guess my question was whether a different kind of role than the ones we talked about [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1423.52s)]
*  earlier in the conversation started to appeal to you more or speak to you more at this stage [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1429.8400000000001s)]
*  of your career. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1436.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I've always loved spiky, difficult women. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  Always that's kind of, you know, you have to understand that when I was 23 years old [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1442.16s)]
*  I made a film with Jonathan Demme called Rachel Getting Married. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1448.24s)]
*  And when I was, oh, but before that when I was 21 years old, I got to make a film with [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1452.52s)]
*  Ang Lee called Brokeback Mountain. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1456.2s)]
*  And so I do think that my, I'm lucky enough to say that within my filmography there has [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1458.2s)]
*  always been both. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1464.06s)]
*  And I think that the last 10 to 12 years has been a less romantic era. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1466.88s)]
*  So I just kind of assumed that that was done and that kind of phase of my career was over. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1474.52s)]
*  And so then to find something that actually said, nah, it's not over. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1479.12s)]
*  And why would you think that it needed to be? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1482.32s)]
*  That was really cool to me. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1485.0s)]
*  Is anything cooking with A Princess Diaries 3? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1487.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1490.1999999999998s)]
*  Ah, I know the answer, but could you tell me more about that? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1491.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't think it would be nice. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1495.6399999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1497.0s)]
*  So, you know, I don't want you to think you're trapped here. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1498.0s)]
*  I think we're about done with the time that I've been. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1500.8s)]
*  I'm not trapped. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1504.44s)]
*  If you're okay to go a little longer, I have. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1506.04s)]
*  I can leave this dinner party at any time. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1507.6s)]
*  No, which is a great line, which have you read the book Acts of Service? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1510.04s)]
*  No, what is it? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1513.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a spicy book. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1514.5s)]
*  But anyway, that's a great line in it where a character finds herself exploring a situation [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1515.5s)]
*  that is uncomfortable, but really tantalizing to her. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1520.12s)]
*  And she keeps thinking of this line that she's learned either through a short story or, I'm [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1523.8s)]
*  not quite sure where, that I can leave this dinner party at any time I want. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1528.44s)]
*  And so I always think that. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1533.0s)]
*  So I often don't feel trapped. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1534.0s)]
*  Wait, does that mean you find this conversation uncomfortable but tantalizing? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1535.4s)]
*  I'm just finding this conversation really lovely. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1542.44s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1544.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm uncomfortable sometimes just because I think you want me to reveal personal things [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1545.3600000000001s)]
*  and I'm just allergic to that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1549.3200000000002s)]
*  But I think that we're having a wonderful time anyway. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1551.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1553.52s)]
*  It's such an interesting thing where in an ideal world, I always want people to be as [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1554.6s)]
*  personal as possible, but I also fully understand that that's something that someone might not [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1561.94s)]
*  want to do and that's okay. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1568.86s)]
*  I just also find it really hard to imagine that people are interested. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1571.28s)]
*  I cannot believe that people are so interested in the sound of my voice and what my brain [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1575.52s)]
*  has to. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1582.52s)]
*  I have a hard time making that leap. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1583.52s)]
*  But then you've also had the experience of people not being nice to you. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1585.72s)]
*  So I totally, I fully understand that it's not as straightforward as I'm making it out [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1588.48s)]
*  to be. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1593.24s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1594.24s)]
*  But it also is and you're right and a hundred percent. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1595.24s)]
*  And again, it's just hard for me to imagine. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1597.44s)]
*  I find it hard to imagine that people would be interested in me. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1601.4s)]
*  That's just a part that I just haven't arrived at yet. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1605.08s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why I don't know that I'm a very good celebrity in that [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1607.52s)]
*  because I don't really know where the walls are between like when it becomes when like [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1612.28s)]
*  just being personal and just being intimate, like just like letting intimate details out. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1619.48s)]
*  I don't know where the wall between that and narcissism and that and self-regard. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1624.52s)]
*  And I think I'm a little because of what I went through, I'm sensitive to the way it [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  can come across. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1634.28s)]
*  And so I would rather be cautious. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1636.08s)]
*  But then the odd thing is, is that as soon as you stop recording this, all the details [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1638.24s)]
*  you want as like literally I don't, I don't hold back. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1643.44s)]
*  It's just because it feels like, okay, but now it's contained. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1646.08s)]
*  Now it's safe. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1649.66s)]
*  But in under these things, I think I'm probably not the best interview. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1651.0s)]
*  To that end, we're going to talk again for a much shorter period in about a week and [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1659.46s)]
*  a half, something like that. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1663.26s)]
*  And you could say, you know, you were wrong about all that. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1664.56s)]
*  I love that. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1667.2s)]
*  I forgot to say this. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1668.2s)]
*  I love the marination time in between. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1669.52s)]
*  I think that's funny enough, really essential to any kind of long form conversation. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1671.64s)]
*  Cool. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1675.68s)]
*  Thank you very much for taking all the time to talk with me today. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1676.68s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1679.76s)]
*  Take care. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1680.76s)]
*  Bye bye. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1681.76s)]
*  Bye bye. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1682.76s)]
*  After the break, I give Ann a call back and the interview gets a little more meta. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1685.5600000000002s)]
*  A part of me just kind of resists the form of this. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1691.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1695.52s)]
*  It's a totally arbitrary and weird. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  And also just slightly rude. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1699.8799999999999s)]
*  Welcome back to the interview. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1713.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1714.8799999999999s)]
*  Hi David. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1715.8799999999999s)]
*  Hi. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  Hi. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1717.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm so sorry to be a couple minutes late. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  My espresso machine was betraying me. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1721.8799999999999s)]
*  That's totally okay. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1725.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1726.48s)]
*  I mean, I think I'm caffeinated enough now, but I'm all right. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1727.48s)]
*  I'm all right. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1732.4s)]
*  I am curious because I have a hunch that maybe you're a ruminator. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1733.4s)]
*  Is there anything about our conversation to this point that you've been thinking about? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1738.84s)]
*  Well, I had a slight word choice the worst moment. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1744.2s)]
*  Before you asked me what my goals are coming up, and I kind of decided not to share them. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1749.84s)]
*  And the reason I gave was because I'd rather not have them shredded. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1755.8799999999999s)]
*  And that just seemed a little harsh. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  And I just regretted that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1762.24s)]
*  And how would you rephrase it? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1764.24s)]
*  I think I would rephrase it just saying it's too tender. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1767.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1770.4399999999998s)]
*  That is very different than shredded. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1771.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1773.04s)]
*  It's just kind of like, you know, and it's just kind of a little bit less self-important. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1774.04s)]
*  Do you think it's telling that your mind initially went to shredded? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1780.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think that's from scar tissue. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1783.32s)]
*  I understand why I said it, but also it's not actually reflective of how I feel. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1787.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1792.04s)]
*  It's reflective of what I fear, but not what I feel. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1793.04s)]
*  I think we're going to get back to that. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1797.48s)]
*  Before then, something that I wanted to return to was, what are the things that used to stress [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1799.28s)]
*  you out so much or that would make you be in your own head? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1808.08s)]
*  I'm just because it's something that you've referred to a couple of times and how you're [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1812.04s)]
*  not stressed out about those things anymore or less in your head about them. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1816.8s)]
*  I'm just trying to make it a little more tangible. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1820.76s)]
*  Are you able to articulate what's in those? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1823.32s)]
*  I think my goal is to heal it and not relive it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1827.84s)]
*  So I'm not trying to be evasive. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  It's just I don't really spend a great deal of time thinking about it because I feel like [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1837.0s)]
*  I found a window and I climbed through it and I work very hard to just be really present [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1842.32s)]
*  here. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1848.9199999999998s)]
*  I think I'm, like I said, I'm more grateful. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1850.72s)]
*  I'm more settled in myself. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1853.76s)]
*  I'm less afraid of things not happening. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1856.92s)]
*  The time in which I was an emerging adult, it was a different time. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1861.1200000000001s)]
*  We weren't having the conversations that we were having now. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1868.96s)]
*  So I think a lot of me, a lot of my thoughts felt very under expressed. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1872.8400000000001s)]
*  So I don't know if it's more curiosity in the world or maybe we have this shared language [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1878.1200000000001s)]
*  now that feels more gentle. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1882.72s)]
*  I feel that there's greater curiosity now. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1888.96s)]
*  Unless harshness, at least in my personal experience. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1894.8400000000001s)]
*  My God, that was such a long answer. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1897.44s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1900.16s)]
*  It's groping in the dark. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1901.16s)]
*  That's all we're ever doing is groping in the dark. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1906.96s)]
*  Can I tell you maybe what's a blindingly obvious realization about my own hypocrisy? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1910.48s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so deep. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1919.6799999999998s)]
*  Tell me everything. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1923.2s)]
*  It's not that deep. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1925.32s)]
*  But I realize when I'm asking you to make things more tangible or asking follow ups [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1926.32s)]
*  that are entreaties to give me more detail or go deeper. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1933.88s)]
*  I'm just thinking about that in the light of the little exchange that we had about hips. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1939.2s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1944.92s)]
*  And you asked me a question and I really got like the, it was almost like the visceral [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1945.92s)]
*  heebie jeebies. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1953.5200000000002s)]
*  I thought I'm not talking about that. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1954.5200000000002s)]
*  And then I thought, gosh, that must be what it feels like for you. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1958.5200000000002s)]
*  Every time I ask a question asking you to go deeper, is the feeling that I had the feeling [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1962.56s)]
*  that you have all the time doing these kinds of things? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1968.0s)]
*  Heebie jeebies. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1970.16s)]
*  Does it give me the heebie jeebies? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1971.16s)]
*  It makes me, you know what it does? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1976.76s)]
*  It just puts me in a defensive position and not in defensive in the sense that I feel [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1979.96s)]
*  attacked, but defensive in the sense that it's really hard to say something revealing [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1983.92s)]
*  with a tape recorder there. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I just feel like I become a more self-conscious, a more neutral version of myself. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1992.0800000000002s)]
*  Like I watch other actresses and they're so free and they're so off the cuff and they [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=1998.4s)]
*  just, not that they're more revealing. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2003.44s)]
*  They're just, I don't know. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2006.0800000000002s)]
*  Maybe I don't even have a word for it, but anyway, so I don't get the heebie jeebies, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2007.0800000000002s)]
*  but I don't know that this is, like I won't take pauses like this to consider my words [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2013.0800000000002s)]
*  that much if we were just having coffee and there wasn't a tape recorder, you know? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2020.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2023.92s)]
*  But do you, you know, it's... [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2026.92s)]
*  I just don't think people are, we don't usually ask people such direct questions. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2028.32s)]
*  Like that's just not the way conversations are usually built. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2032.92s)]
*  Normally, trust is established each by sharing something about ourselves and you build up [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2035.96s)]
*  a mutual understanding of each other. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2041.3600000000001s)]
*  And so a part of me just kind of resists the form of this. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2049.32s)]
*  Well, it's a totally arbitrary and weird, yeah. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2050.32s)]
*  But it also just slightly rude. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2052.32s)]
*  But that's just me and I just need to, I just kind of need to work on accepting, like I [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2055.32s)]
*  said, that this is just the way this is built. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2063.32s)]
*  Well, you know, I definitely heard you when you said, you know, you're more comfortable [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2066.28s)]
*  sort of talking about and through your characters than talking about yourself. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2072.36s)]
*  But as someone who has my job and as someone who's interested in the person and the life [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2076.96s)]
*  that animates the work, I'm of course curious about you and what it's like to be you. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2085.04s)]
*  And that interest is, you know, it's obviously rooted in an assumption that who you are is [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2092.1200000000003s)]
*  meaningful to audiences or fans, you know, that the idea that they have some understanding [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2099.28s)]
*  of you outside your work matters in some way. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2104.52s)]
*  Do you think that matters? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2107.6s)]
*  I think I understand the question that my life is somehow as interesting as my work. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2109.2000000000003s)]
*  Or just that people having an understanding of who you are outside of the work is in some [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2114.96s)]
*  way meaningful. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2119.34s)]
*  Just trying to think if it's meaningful to me with other people. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2120.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2125.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2126.08s)]
*  Do you ever ever have the experience that sometimes you just want to watch a film in [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2127.08s)]
*  another language because you're less familiar with the personal life of the actor and it [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2131.84s)]
*  just lets you get lost in the story? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2135.7200000000003s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2138.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2139.52s)]
*  So a part of me, I would rather the people, I don't know, it's kind of strange, but like [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2140.52s)]
*  I just, I don't want to distract from trying it all. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2147.7200000000003s)]
*  Also going back to the thing before about direct questions and, you know, getting where [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2152.7200000000003s)]
*  I get the heebie-jeebies and all that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2157.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm just very protective and I don't ever want to be, I worry about like other people [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2159.12s)]
*  in the way the press can be opportunistic because I can have a perfectly lovely respectful [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2165.8s)]
*  conversation with you. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2170.96s)]
*  And then to have something that is real and meaningful and personal and to like watch [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2173.4s)]
*  it get filtered through all the different levels of media until it like arrives at the [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2178.84s)]
*  tabloid version. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2183.52s)]
*  It just kind of makes you never want to say anything that could be, I'm going to use a [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2184.72s)]
*  big word and it's probably an unwise word to use, but that can be weaponized against [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2190.0s)]
*  the actor. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2195.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I have like this awesome story about Nick that I want to tell and it's like on [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2197.24s)]
*  the tip of my tongue right now, but I don't want to tell it because I haven't asked him [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2200.8399999999997s)]
*  if it's cool. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2203.52s)]
*  You're a co-star in the film, yeah. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2204.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2206.16s)]
*  And I'm just aware that he'd have to answer questions about it for the next three months [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2207.16s)]
*  to 30 years. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2211.8799999999997s)]
*  Like the way that I'm sure somewhat annoyingly you're still being asked questions, including [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2214.8799999999997s)]
*  by me about bad experiences you had on the internet a lifetime ago. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2218.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't find you annoying. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2222.8799999999997s)]
*  I value what you do. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2225.9199999999996s)]
*  And just because I'm not the most innately forthcoming person doesn't mean I don't think [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2227.48s)]
*  that this isn't a wonderful forum in a lot of ways. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2232.8799999999997s)]
*  And yeah, I'm just amazed by people who can just express themselves. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2236.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm amazed by them. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2243.32s)]
*  Well, you just express yourself in different ways. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2245.32s)]
*  I really love expressing myself through my characters. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2248.36s)]
*  I really, really do. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2251.0s)]
*  I kind of also, I think, no, nevermind. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2252.64s)]
*  The most telling and Hathaway you know, I think nevermind. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2258.52s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2262.7599999999998s)]
*  Give me another 25 years. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe I'll relax a little bit more. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2266.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2267.92s)]
*  I'll get back. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2268.92s)]
*  I'll get back in touch then. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2269.92s)]
*  I do want to end on something fun though. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2271.32s)]
*  Tell me a funny story. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2273.36s)]
*  You know, this didn't happen on set, but I can tell you something. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2274.36s)]
*  When I was making the idea of you, I was very lucky, so spoiled, staying in a beautiful [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2278.2400000000002s)]
*  house in Atlanta, Georgia that was much larger than my needs. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2282.7200000000003s)]
*  So I would get home from work and I'd be in this house by myself. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2288.32s)]
*  And I was just like, and it was just that was giving me the heebie-jeebies. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2293.36s)]
*  I was trying to figure out like, what was like, why was I feeling this so intensely? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2297.68s)]
*  And I realized there was no laughter in the house. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2302.68s)]
*  And when you have a big house like that, you need laughter. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2306.6s)]
*  And so I started to listen to stand up specials and I got really into Adam Sandler's 100% [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2310.56s)]
*  fresh. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2316.52s)]
*  And I think that Adam Sandler is as extraordinary, beloved and iconic as Adam Sandler is, I think [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2317.52s)]
*  he's underappreciated. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2325.48s)]
*  I think he's such a stealth genius. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2326.48s)]
*  You know, like I have that kind of level of just appreciation for him. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2330.12s)]
*  I can quote you every single line from Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2334.44s)]
*  I'm a wedding singer. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2337.8s)]
*  I'm a big fan. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2338.8s)]
*  I'm going to put your feet too far. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2339.8s)]
*  Let's trade Sandler lines. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2343.08s)]
*  I'll go first from his movies. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2344.2s)]
*  I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2346.76s)]
*  You eat pieces of shit for breakfast? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2349.68s)]
*  Oh, you got it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2351.68s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2352.68s)]
*  No, no, then the best follow up ever. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2354.16s)]
*  No. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2356.16s)]
*  If pee in my pants is cool, then I'm Miles Davis. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2360.16s)]
*  Or call me Miles Davis. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2363.16s)]
*  I think that's a good idea. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2366.16s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2368.16s)]
*  Shampoo is better. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2369.16s)]
*  I go on first and leave the hair clean. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2370.16s)]
*  No, conditioner is better. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2373.16s)]
*  I leave the hair silky and smooth. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2375.16s)]
*  Oh, really fluid. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2377.16s)]
*  Bleh, bleh, bleh. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2378.16s)]
*  Hold on, wait for it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2379.16s)]
*  Stop looking at me, Schwann. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2380.16s)]
*  Very good, very good. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2383.64s)]
*  You know, I feel bad. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2386.64s)]
*  I'm just taking up your time now just jabbering about Adam Sandler. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2387.64s)]
*  So this is the part that I'm talking about. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2390.64s)]
*  Like, I feel much more comfortable talking about Adam Sandler, who I've never met, than [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2394.64s)]
*  I do like talking about what makes me tick. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2399.64s)]
*  I feel like, you know, you get to know somebody just by talking about stuff rather than describing [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2402.64s)]
*  yourself. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2407.64s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2408.64s)]
*  I do. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2409.64s)]
*  I do. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2410.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2411.64s)]
*  But that's also, again, I just need to figure out how to practice. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2413.12s)]
*  Well, I hope this has been part of that practice. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2418.12s)]
*  And I, again, just want to say thank you. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2421.12s)]
*  And maybe sometime I'll see you down the line and we'll talk about Adam Sandler. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2424.12s)]
*  Thank you very, very much. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2428.12s)]
*  And be well, be well. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2430.12s)]
*  Stretch your hips out. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2432.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2434.12s)]
*  Take care. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2435.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2436.12s)]
*  Bye. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA-gYpUJ5A&t=2437.12s)]
