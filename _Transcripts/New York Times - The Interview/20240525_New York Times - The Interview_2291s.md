# 'The Interview': Ted Sarandos’s Plan to Get You to Binge Even More
**New York Times - The Interview:** [May 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=6.28s)]
*  If you're like me, you probably spent some large portion of this week sitting on your [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=11.16s)]
*  sofa watching Netflix. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=16.0s)]
*  Rom-coms are my thing, and my latest obsession is this Turkish series. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=18.92s)]
*  It's called Thank You, Next. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=23.04s)]
*  Once I watch a few international rom-coms, you can bet that Netflix is going to feed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=25.16s)]
*  me more of them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=30.32s)]
*  Maybe you've had this experience with sports documentaries or thrillers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=32.08s)]
*  But as I'm vegging out on the couch, I'm not really thinking much about the people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=35.32s)]
*  shaping my habit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=40.2s)]
*  That's why I wanted to talk to Ted Sarandos. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=42.2s)]
*  Sarandos has been at Netflix for 24 years, nearly as long as founder Reed Hastings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=45.36s)]
*  He's now the co-CEO of the company, along with Greg Peters, and is in charge of their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=50.84s)]
*  creative output. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  He oversaw Netflix's early expansion into streaming and pioneered the binge watch. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  Under him, the company developed one of the most powerful algorithms out there, the one [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=63.24s)]
*  keeping me glued to my sofa. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=68.0s)]
*  He was also the guy who greenlit Netflix's first original productions, like House of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=70.68s)]
*  Cards, making Netflix into a studio, not just a platform. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=74.4s)]
*  And he's led the company as it's ventured into reality TV, prestige film, and live entertainment, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=79.84s)]
*  including a just announced deal to broadcast some of the NFL's Christmas Day games. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=85.72s)]
*  There have been less rosy moments at the company in recent years, including a few rounds of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  layoffs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  But through it all, Sarandos keeps giving audiences more of what we want. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Whether that's good for us or not is another question. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=102.44s)]
*  And that's a big part of what we talked about. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=105.94s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Ted Sarandos. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=108.68s)]
*  As I've been reading about you, you have an unusual background for a Hollywood or tech [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  CEO. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  I would agree with that assessment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think as Reed may have said it early in my career here, which is I did not breathe [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  the rarefied air. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about how you came up? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll go give real quickly in the far back, which is that my grandfather came [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=133.32000000000002s)]
*  from Samos, Greece. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=139.52s)]
*  He used to read cowboy novels. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=142.22s)]
*  And he came to America thinking that he could be a trail cook. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=145.72s)]
*  He found out quickly that there was no trail cook jobs in New Jersey. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=149.52s)]
*  He took one vacation in his lifetime, which was to Arizona to see a rodeo. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  And from that day forward, he wore a bolo tie every day. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  He talked about that vacation until he died. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  And in tribute to him, all eight of the kids moved to Arizona after he passed away, including [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  my father. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  My parents had four kids in their 20s. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=170.58s)]
*  So these were kids raising kids really. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=172.8s)]
*  And our house was always chaos. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=175.22000000000003s)]
*  And my only escape from that chaos was that little box and I watched a lot of television. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  And my mom in her own kind of reckless way, when we couldn't afford it, would always buy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=184.0s)]
*  gadgets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=189.08s)]
*  We were the first people I know to have a VCR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=190.8s)]
*  And it was a very unaffordable luxury at that time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  And most of my upbringing, we never had all the utilities on at the same time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=196.68s)]
*  So the gas would be cut off and the foam would be cut off and the electric would come up, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=201.12s)]
*  but never all simultaneously. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=205.0s)]
*  But for some reason, we had a VCR. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  And total happenstance. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=210.08s)]
*  The second video store in the state of Arizona opened up two blocks from my house. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=211.96s)]
*  Do you remember the first thing you ever checked out in the video store? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=216.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was a filmed version of the Willie Nelson Fourth of July picnic. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=220.64s)]
*  For real? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=225.76s)]
*  That was the thing that you... [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=226.76s)]
*  That was the very first thing I rented. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=228.44s)]
*  And you actually end up working at a video store. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  I did at that very video store, Arizona Video Cassettes West. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=235.04s)]
*  By the way, that's a very descriptive name, Arizona Video Cassettes West. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=237.88s)]
*  I told you exactly what we do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  I dropped out of college at a community college and I worked at the video store full time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=244.76s)]
*  The way that I've heard you tell it, there was like 900 titles in the catalog and you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  would have seen all of them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  And people would come in and ask you for recommendations. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=257.68s)]
*  Is that how that would work? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  That's how it worked generally. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  I think people would walk in and roam around the stores aimlessly. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  But actually, they kind of enjoyed that experience. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=266.24s)]
*  It was pretty novel at the beginning. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=268.12s)]
*  But then you really were trying to find something in that sea of boxes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=269.84s)]
*  Eventually, I realized I had this interesting capacity for remembering these movies one [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=274.48s)]
*  after another and the ability to put that one and that one's kind of like that one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=280.56s)]
*  When people would come in, I would remember, oh, hey, remember you liked that movie? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=286.0s)]
*  You're going to love this one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=289.0s)]
*  I got good enough at it that even when the stores were very busy and there was a long [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=290.24s)]
*  line, they would wait for me because they wanted me to suggest something to them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=293.52s)]
*  It told me something very important, which is people really value that choice. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=298.08s)]
*  So cut to now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=303.44s)]
*  And when people talk about how we're entertained, it's all about the streaming wars, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=306.08s)]
*  So we have Peacock and we have Hulu and we have Apple Plus and we have Macs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=314.4s)]
*  And they all spent a fortune to try and catch up with Netflix. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=318.92s)]
*  And the consensus seems to be that you, Netflix, won the war. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=323.4s)]
*  I try not to take those stories too seriously, any more than we did a couple of years ago [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=328.84s)]
*  when they said we were dead. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=332.96s)]
*  So I think we have to really remember this is a long, long journey, lots of battles along [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=334.52s)]
*  the way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=340.32s)]
*  And this is probably a battle more than it is winning a war. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=341.32s)]
*  Early on, I think we were discounted because I think the studios thought these tech guys [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=346.0s)]
*  are never going to figure out programming. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=352.08s)]
*  They're never going to figure out the creative part of the business. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think we largely have proved them wrong. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=357.44s)]
*  And I think it would be crazy for us to think, well, these entertainment companies are never [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=360.68s)]
*  going to figure out the tech. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=364.92s)]
*  I do just want to get your sense of what is happening in Hollywood right now because the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=367.56s)]
*  box office is down, studios are laying off people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=374.16s)]
*  You talk to people there and people feel gloomy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=379.0s)]
*  They feel afraid. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=381.48s)]
*  One of the most storied studios is on the block, Paramount. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=383.26s)]
*  What is your feeling about what's going on if it isn't Netflix's victory? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=388.04s)]
*  Because you have so fundamentally shifted what happens in Hollywood that that has had [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  some knock-on effects. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=399.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=400.92s)]
*  I think if in periods of radical change in any industry, the legacy players generally [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=401.92s)]
*  have a challenge, which is they're trying to protect their legacy businesses. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  We entered into a business in transition when we started mailing DVDs 25 years ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=413.92s)]
*  We knew that physical media was not going to be the future. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=420.26s)]
*  When I met Reed Hastings in 1999, he described the world we live in right now, which is almost [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  all entertainment is going to come into the home on the internet. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  And he told me that at a time when literally no entertainment was coming into the home [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=433.6s)]
*  on the internet. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=437.88s)]
*  And so it's a very big vision to have, and it really helped us navigate this transition [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=439.3s)]
*  from physical to digital because we didn't spend any time trying to protect our DVD business. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=444.14s)]
*  As it started to wane, we started to invest in more and more and more in streaming. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=451.78000000000003s)]
*  And we did that because we knew that that's where the puck was going. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=458.02s)]
*  At one point, our DVD business was driving all the profit of the business and a lot of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  the revenue of the business. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=466.7s)]
*  And we made a conscious decision to stop inviting the DVD employees to the company meeting. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=469.18s)]
*  We were that kind of rigid about where this thing was heading. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=474.18s)]
*  That's harsh. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=477.02s)]
*  It does sound harsh that we did that, but it got the whole company in the mindset is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=478.14s)]
*  that we shouldn't keep investing in the old business. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=482.3s)]
*  It's going to prevent us from investing in the new business. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  And the new business is going to get us to the next place. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=487.1s)]
*  Which leads us to where Netflix is today, where you bring a lot of global content in. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=489.86s)]
*  You have all sorts of different types of things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=494.66s)]
*  In the job you have now, you are probably best positioned to shape what kind of culture [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=497.74s)]
*  people are consuming. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=503.3s)]
*  What have you noticed about shifting tastes in America? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  I think we're entering into a new era now where content and great stories can come from [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  almost anywhere in the world. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=514.66s)]
*  And they can very conveniently sit on the shelf, I'm doing air quotes right now, next [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=516.42s)]
*  show and you will discover an incredible story from Korea or an incredible story from Italy [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=523.02s)]
*  or incredible story from Spain that you would otherwise have no access to and maybe no awareness [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=529.54s)]
*  of before. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=535.02s)]
*  But that it's this kind of storytelling that's very close to the kind of storytelling that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=536.38s)]
*  you like. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=540.6999999999999s)]
*  So the creator of Squid Game, he pitched that show as a movie for 10 years. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  He'd almost completely given up on it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=546.66s)]
*  And our team in Korea had the foresight to advise him that this is a great story, but [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=548.96s)]
*  it's a much bigger world. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  Have you ever thought about going out and trying to break down that world a little more [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=554.96s)]
*  and giving us a little more exposition? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  And he went off and wrote those scripts and made Squid Game. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=560.6s)]
*  And Squid Game became the most watched show in the history of Netflix around the world, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  including in the United States. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Did that surprise you at the time? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=568.36s)]
*  It blew my mind. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=570.2s)]
*  I knew it was great. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=571.76s)]
*  I knew it would do great in Korea, but I had no idea it would be the most watched show [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=573.52s)]
*  on television, maybe in the history of television. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=579.14s)]
*  But when Scott Frank wrote Queen's Gambit, you know, that was a script that he could [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=582.2199999999999s)]
*  not sell as a film for the longest time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=586.62s)]
*  And it was an enormous success on Netflix around the world. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  And it was just one decision away from still sitting on a shelf, you know, gathering dust. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=591.88s)]
*  So you're giving these wonderful examples of the kinds of shows that Netflix has been [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=597.76s)]
*  able to bring to people. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  These are prestige shows. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=603.86s)]
*  I am thinking of this, though, in terms of this broader question of how we consume culture [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=605.86s)]
*  today. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=610.82s)]
*  I'm thinking about my own experience on Netflix. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=611.82s)]
*  So my husband likes horror, and his Netflix account looks very different to mine. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  In fact, we keep it very, very separate. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=621.46s)]
*  His is Lulu Don't Touch, and mine is Lulu Romcom. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=624.02s)]
*  These are your profile names? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=628.1s)]
*  These are our profile names. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=629.1s)]
*  He doesn't want me to muddy his horror algorithm. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=630.9s)]
*  And when you look at them both, he doesn't get rom-coms and I don't get horror. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=635.78s)]
*  And it feels like the cultural curation is more a science than an art. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=641.38s)]
*  That thing that used to be the connection where someone might tell you about something, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=646.26s)]
*  now it's managed in a way that can allow for these serendipitous things like the surprise [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=651.06s)]
*  of Squid Game, but often gives you more of what you already want. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=657.62s)]
*  I guess I'm just asking, has streaming been good for culture? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=661.14s)]
*  Oh, I think it's been great for culture. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=664.9000000000001s)]
*  Not only great for culture in a strange way, I think it's been great to make the world [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=666.3000000000001s)]
*  a safer place. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=669.6600000000001s)]
*  Oh, tell me why. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=671.1s)]
*  I think you're exposed to cultures around the world in a way that makes you more understanding [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=672.5400000000001s)]
*  and empathetic. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=677.1400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen the movie, like A Separation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=678.1400000000001s)]
*  It's a story of a couple getting divorced that I ran, and it's like you realize when [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=683.7800000000001s)]
*  you watch it is how much we have in common with each other around the world. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=687.46s)]
*  I think it's just like all storytelling makes the world a smaller, safer place. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=692.38s)]
*  But doesn't it atomize you too? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=696.06s)]
*  This idea of I'm having my own unique experience, myself, my choices, that I get fed more of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=698.66s)]
*  the same, and this idea of communal culture and communal spaces gets pushed away. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=705.42s)]
*  I think it's happening around when you see something like Baby Reindeer. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=713.58s)]
*  There was a time when something like Baby Reindeer would not even be seen in the United [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=718.3s)]
*  States, and if it did, it'd be seen on PBS once. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=722.42s)]
*  We should say, as we're speaking, Baby Reindeer is the number one show on Netflix. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=724.5799999999999s)]
*  It's about a stalker. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=728.38s)]
*  It has some dark themes of sexual assault, and it's been a hit. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=730.22s)]
*  And written and created and stars the person who's telling their own story about what happened [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=735.86s)]
*  to them. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=739.9s)]
*  It's very, very big in the UK. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=740.9s)]
*  In that way that Netflix does this, it gets picked up in the algorithm and starts getting [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=743.1s)]
*  more and more presented. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=747.62s)]
*  Because when something gets that big in one country, it's likely there's a lot of audience [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=748.98s)]
*  for it outside of that country. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=754.1s)]
*  And it's been an enormous hit around the world. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=756.5s)]
*  And the way that you just described it, I may never watch. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=757.94s)]
*  But I think when you sit down and say, this is somebody who is being stalked by a woman [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=760.98s)]
*  who, and the situation is becoming more and more dangerous, and yet he's oddly likes it [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=766.98s)]
*  enough that he doesn't want to stop it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=772.98s)]
*  And he has to try to figure out what is it about him that makes him not want to stop [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=774.86s)]
*  this incredibly dangerous situation. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=778.58s)]
*  And it impacts over these incredible episodes of this story that people devour. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=781.14s)]
*  And I don't think it's because it's dark and I don't think it's because it's weird. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=787.0200000000001s)]
*  I think it's because it's a really incredible human story. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=789.6600000000001s)]
*  Just to come back to something you said here, are international audiences pushing American [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=793.62s)]
*  audiences to broaden their horizons? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  That's an interesting feedback loop. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=799.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, I mean, what it's pushing is, is that you don't have to adapt your storytelling [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=802.34s)]
*  to America to work. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  If your movie, if your film works, if your TV series works in the home country, it's [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  got to be very authentic. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think what international audiences pick up on is that authenticity. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  So I do think when you try to engineer something to travel, it really appeals to no one. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  I can't think of anything that we've done that has been engineered to travel that actually [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=825.16s)]
*  did travel. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=829.36s)]
*  I'm thinking in particular of, you know, Hollywood studios trying to make global hits, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=830.36s)]
*  That will play in China, that will play in the United States, that will be popular in [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=836.88s)]
*  Argentina. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=842.0s)]
*  That's hard. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=843.0s)]
*  And I do think that globalization of American film has disconnected American film from audiences. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=844.0s)]
*  I think that the love affair with film is lessened because of it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=850.52s)]
*  So we're talking about prestige shows, global hits, but there's also been a lot of discussion [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=855.2s)]
*  about what's been dubbed folding your laundry shows, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=860.52s)]
*  Something that isn't difficult to watch, it's light, it's fun, it's not expensive to make. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=865.32s)]
*  And you know, you've got a lot of examples of that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  Selling Sunset, Jinnion Georgia, Alone, the survivalist show. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=871.48s)]
*  Do you feel like you've cornered the market on that? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=875.5600000000001s)]
*  And is that like a title that you want to own? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=877.08s)]
*  If there's one quote that I could take back, it would have been in 2012, I said, we're [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=880.5200000000001s)]
*  going to become HBO before HBO could become us. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  What I was trying to say is, you know, at that time, HBO was, I think, the gold standard [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=892.6s)]
*  of original programming. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  What I should have said back then is we want to be HBO and CBS and BBC and all those different [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=899.0400000000001s)]
*  networks around the world that entertain people and not narrow it to just HBO. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=905.0s)]
*  Because I do think that prestige of the programming plays a very important role in culture, but [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=909.6s)]
*  it's very small. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=915.2s)]
*  It's a boutique business. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=916.44s)]
*  We're currently programming for about 650 million people around the world. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=918.64s)]
*  We have to have a very broad variety of things that people watch and love. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=923.64s)]
*  So I think we are, again, very consumer centric. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=928.36s)]
*  So we take a consumer view of quality. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=930.96s)]
*  The people who love Jinnion Georgia will tell you, Jinnion Georgia is great. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=933.3000000000001s)]
*  So to me, that's quality television. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=938.2s)]
*  And if that's what you want to watch, we want to make the best version of that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=940.76s)]
*  I want to ask you about the movie side of things, because we've been talking about [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=945.24s)]
*  the series. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=949.44s)]
*  You have a new head of film, Dan Lin, and that suggests to me that you're tweaking [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=951.5200000000001s)]
*  strategy. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  Whenever somebody new comes in, they have an idea of what they want to do differently [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  and they have a different charge. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=961.0s)]
*  And a criticism of Netflix from some corners is that you make too much stuff that isn't [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=963.6400000000001s)]
*  as good as it could be, specifically in movies. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=970.6400000000001s)]
*  So I guess the question is, are you trying to make better movies now? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=974.5s)]
*  Is that the mandate? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=977.28s)]
*  So I will back up and say that I don't agree with the premise that quantity and quality [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=979.42s)]
*  are somehow in conflict with each other. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=985.92s)]
*  We've had eight Best Picture nominees in the last five years on Netflix. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=990.18s)]
*  So I do think we've been making a, like we were talking about earlier about the breadth [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=995.66s)]
*  of things. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1000.06s)]
*  I think our content, our programming and our movie programming has been great, but it's [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1001.4599999999999s)]
*  just not all for you. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1005.18s)]
*  And it's not meant to be all for you. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1006.18s)]
*  I know, but you also have an Irish wish, for example. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  And I was looking at your summer slate, the movies are all pretty mid-tier. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1010.9799999999999s)]
*  Well look, I think, like I said, I think the way that we all talk about films culturally, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1015.8599999999999s)]
*  they tend to wrap around either things that were number one at the box office or won the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1021.2199999999999s)]
*  Oscar for Best Picture and almost nothing in between. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1025.8999999999999s)]
*  And I do think that people's tastes are incredibly broad and diverse. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1029.46s)]
*  Irish wish is great. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1032.82s)]
*  If you love a rom-com, you'd like it? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1033.82s)]
*  I'm giving you a face. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1036.22s)]
*  I saw the face. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1037.74s)]
*  My point is, is that I'm going by the numbers, how many people watch it, how many people [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1038.74s)]
*  watch the whole thing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1043.6200000000001s)]
*  People generally turn off things they don't like in this on-demand world. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1044.78s)]
*  Us rom-com lovers are very committed to watch things to the bitter end. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1047.94s)]
*  But again, I think that Irish wish is at the kind of high end of the hallmark scale. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1053.48s)]
*  Not at the kind of mid-tier of the Fox searchlight scale. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1059.62s)]
*  I don't want to get tied up on Irish wish, but I do want to understand a little bit of [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1065.1s)]
*  what is going to change now, if anything. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1068.6599999999999s)]
*  Because you have made films like The Grey Man. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1071.3s)]
*  It had a budget of 200 million. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1073.74s)]
*  Red Notice was the same. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1075.62s)]
*  They weren't critical successes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  So I guess, how are you thinking about how to make movies at Netflix? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1079.74s)]
*  Look, I would just say that we've never at any point wanted to make bad movies at Netflix. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1084.7800000000002s)]
*  We do acknowledge that it's a creative endeavor and some things don't go as planned. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1089.6200000000001s)]
*  I would tell you though that I'm very pleased with the mix of how things have come out. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1093.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm very pleased that we generally have films in the hunt for the Oscar and we have films [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1099.14s)]
*  that people just really like. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1103.3400000000001s)]
*  Just entertaining. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1104.94s)]
*  And to your point, Red Notice is one of the most successful films we've ever had on Netflix [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1105.94s)]
*  in terms of the audience. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1110.38s)]
*  I guess what I'm asking is, are you going to spend that kind of money going forward? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1112.1s)]
*  I think some of that early big budgets things were mostly around the fact that we had to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1116.3799999999999s)]
*  pay a little bit of a pioneer tax as we entered into that film space where we're competing [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1121.78s)]
*  with movies at the box office. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1126.22s)]
*  So we probably in those early days of the big budgets, things were bigger budgets than [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1127.94s)]
*  they needed to be. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1132.3799999999999s)]
*  Those big giant scale movies, when they deliver, there's nothing better. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1133.78s)]
*  And when they miss, man, it's a sting. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1137.44s)]
*  But I would tell you that what I push our creative teams across the board to do is push [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1140.28s)]
*  on the ambition. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  Push for the audience, not just to make things bigger, but to make them better. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1146.3s)]
*  Always. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1149.8s)]
*  I just want to take a step back here from talk about strategy because it wasn't always [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1152.52s)]
*  certain that Netflix was going to be where it is now. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1157.96s)]
*  In 2022, your stock plunged 70% after you lost subscribers for the first time since [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1160.8s)]
*  2011. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1166.34s)]
*  Can you take me to that moment as a leader? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1167.34s)]
*  What do you do when something like that happens? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1170.04s)]
*  I mean, you'd had this exponential growth and then all of a sudden it was a difficult [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  moment. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1177.84s)]
*  What is the calibration for you? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1179.08s)]
*  On any given day, we can lose or gain 200,000 subscribers, which is what that was, which [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1181.44s)]
*  was the first time we went negative. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  We went negative by 200,000 subscribers. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1188.56s)]
*  And if the quarter had ended a few weeks later, that wouldn't have been the case. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1190.48s)]
*  This is probably the benefit of being around for a long time. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1194.32s)]
*  We had times that were much tougher than that in terms of where we were heading with [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1198.4s)]
*  the business in the earliest days, before we were a public company even. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1202.16s)]
*  And in fact, when you look back at everything, I think you look back at any chart that's [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1207.3200000000002s)]
*  straight up and to the right and you think nothing ever went wrong. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1211.3200000000002s)]
*  That's what it looks like when you look back. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1214.48s)]
*  But in the moment, those little tiny dips in hills and valleys were emotionally very [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1216.3600000000001s)]
*  rocking to a company and to a culture. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1222.0400000000002s)]
*  What you did is you threw out some of the company's longstanding core principles, chief [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1225.3200000000002s)]
*  among them not having advertisers. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  You introduced an ad-supported subscription tier. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1232.68s)]
*  And so I'm just wondering, as someone who had been with Netflix for as long as you had, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1236.16s)]
*  did it feel like that was a real turn betraying the identity of the company? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  You had to make a tough choice. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1247.8000000000002s)]
*  It really wasn't that we were core principles against advertising. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1249.8200000000002s)]
*  Advertising was our counter position to television the way that no late fees was our counter [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  position to video stores in our DVD days. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1258.48s)]
*  What do people don't like about TV? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1261.6399999999999s)]
*  Watching the ads and waiting a week for the next episode. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1264.24s)]
*  We realized, though, in this world of unlimited choice, what we didn't do is give a choice [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  to people who didn't mind advertising at all and wanted a lower price. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1270.6s)]
*  So for us, we thought that it was actually market expanding to give more choice to folks [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1274.52s)]
*  if they wanted a lower price and they didn't mind ads. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1279.2s)]
*  So you got to evolve. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1281.7s)]
*  I want to ask you a little bit more about you as a leader. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1282.7s)]
*  Hollywood celebrities and leaders have always been politically active. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1289.14s)]
*  And you also have been no exception. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1293.78s)]
*  In 2020, you supported Black Lives Matter. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1295.54s)]
*  During the invasion of Ukraine, you pulled Netflix out of Russia. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1298.98s)]
*  It seems though that corporate activism is on its way out. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1302.8600000000001s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1306.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1309.14s)]
*  Look, I don't think it's because of when you think about diversity, diversity should [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1310.14s)]
*  be all things, including diversity of thought, which makes political activism of companies [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  very difficult because people have different opinions and different ideas and different [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1320.72s)]
*  thoughts and you're representing a lot of different constituencies. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1324.64s)]
*  So I think companies should be very, very careful about how they insert themselves into [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1327.3200000000002s)]
*  these discussions. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1332.94s)]
*  Sometimes when it's just a matter of pretty pure black and white right and wrong. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1334.9s)]
*  I think pulling out of Russia was a much clearer decision of anything we've ever done. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1339.8999999999999s)]
*  It's impossible to do business in Russia without being in business with that government. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1344.4799999999998s)]
*  So for me, that was kind of a no brainer decision. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1349.3999999999999s)]
*  I didn't view it as political. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1351.4599999999998s)]
*  I viewed it as quite impractical to do anything but. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1354.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've seen other companies in Hollywood, Disney, among others, but we're seeing Google [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1357.74s)]
*  now sort of crack down on internal activism within their company. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1363.7s)]
*  You say it's a difficult balancing act. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1370.02s)]
*  And so as a company that tries to be all things to all people, how do you navigate that? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1373.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think I really, people have very different sensibilities about things depending on where [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1378.5800000000002s)]
*  they are in the world and different opinions of these things. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1383.46s)]
*  And I do think that it's one of those things where it's very hard to say that our view [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1386.52s)]
*  would represent the views of all of our members and all of our employees. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1390.44s)]
*  I think that would be a very high bar to clear, but that is the clear. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1393.96s)]
*  That is the bar I would like it to clear if we're going to do if we do that as a company. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1397.88s)]
*  And I do think, by the way, just people look for I don't know why that happened over the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1401.6000000000001s)]
*  last couple of years, or people looked for two corporate leaders to do that, to do those [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1405.3200000000002s)]
*  things they didn't used to. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1408.52s)]
*  I want to look ahead to the future because obviously what Netflix decides to do will [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1411.6000000000001s)]
*  impact the way that we all consume culture. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1417.76s)]
*  Do you see Netflix now as sort of middle aged? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1421.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're no longer the upstart business that needs to constantly be proving itself [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1423.3200000000002s)]
*  and now you're a more mature business. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1428.3600000000001s)]
*  Middle age might be the wrong word, I guess. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1430.3600000000001s)]
*  Middle age might be too old. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1431.8400000000001s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1432.8400000000001s)]
*  Speaking for myself here. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1433.8400000000001s)]
*  Speaking as someone like myself who is, I mean, yeah, if I think I'm going to live to [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1436.8400000000001s)]
*  120 I'm middle aged. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1440.92s)]
*  But I think the business is maturing, of course. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1442.8s)]
*  And I think it's taking on different characteristics and again those things that you didn't do [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1445.8s)]
*  before. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1450.36s)]
*  We weren't adamantly against advertising. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1451.36s)]
*  But when you start thinking about it as actually growing the addressable market for Netflix, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1453.8s)]
*  that's a great thing to do advertising. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1457.9199999999998s)]
*  Just do it well and make sure that it works well both for the members and for advertisers. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1459.6s)]
*  So who is your competitor now? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1463.8s)]
*  Look, I think we compete for screen time. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1465.6399999999999s)]
*  That's the easiest way to do it. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1468.24s)]
*  Almost all watching on Netflix is on a big screen on the television. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1469.48s)]
*  When we're in the US, we're about 10% of screen time on connected televisions. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1472.96s)]
*  Outside of the US, we're as little as 3%. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1479.32s)]
*  Ton of room to grow. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  But we compete with everything else that happens on that screen. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1482.88s)]
*  Social media, including YouTube, other streaming apps, and gaming, which takes up a lot of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1486.04s)]
*  screen time. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, YouTube is actually bigger than you. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1492.8400000000001s)]
*  It's mostly free. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1496.8400000000001s)]
*  Free is super popular. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1497.8400000000001s)]
*  Free is super popular and you're not free. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1499.72s)]
*  How do you compete with free? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1503.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think you've got to be worth paying for all the time. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  And we have to be better at them all the time, at the programming, at the choosing of it, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1508.6799999999998s)]
*  at driving the conversation around the world of it, which drives the kind of must-see-ness [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1513.04s)]
*  of the things that we're doing. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1516.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's still a lot of work to do there. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1518.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one thing that YouTube's had for a while that you're just starting to break [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1520.4399999999998s)]
*  into is live TV. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1523.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1525.52s)]
*  This year, WWE announced it was bringing Raw, the weekly live pro wrestling show, to Netflix. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1527.2s)]
*  You've just had live roasts, comedy specials. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1531.8s)]
*  Talk me through the move into live entertainment. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1535.8799999999999s)]
*  What is that doing for you? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1537.9s)]
*  It's really incredible, the conversation that gets driven around the world around a big [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1539.96s)]
*  live event. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1544.0s)]
*  You know, in a world of on-demand and total control, the novelty of a big live event, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1545.0s)]
*  if it's the Super Bowl or the Tom Brady roast, is people get very excited that they're all [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1550.72s)]
*  watching it at the same time. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1555.5s)]
*  And what we saw with the Tom Brady roast was it was driving so much conversation around [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1556.5s)]
*  the world that the audience kept growing and growing and growing minute on minute that [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1561.46s)]
*  people kept coming to it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1565.22s)]
*  And I just look at that as saying, well, there's some real value in people gathering around [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1566.7s)]
*  the TV at the same time and doing that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1570.5800000000002s)]
*  It's a novel. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1572.66s)]
*  It's not the way people watch most things, but it's something we don't want to not be [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1573.66s)]
*  a part of because it's happening on that television screen and that people get very excited about [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1577.14s)]
*  it. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1581.6200000000001s)]
*  You're making me laugh a little because you're like reinventing the live special. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1582.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, live has been around for a long time, it turns out. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1585.78s)]
*  We started that way, as you recall. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1588.62s)]
*  But I do think it's funny, the novelty of it, because I do remember as a kid when Roots [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1590.1399999999999s)]
*  was on every night for the streets were empty and people were in there. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1596.58s)]
*  I remember in the early days of TV, I Love Lucy, when they would go to a commercial break, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1600.6599999999999s)]
*  the water pressure would go down because everyone went to the bathroom at the same time. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1606.1s)]
*  So we don't want to not be part of all of those things that we'd look to that happen [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1609.38s)]
*  on that screen. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1613.66s)]
*  I just want to look ahead in our last few minutes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1614.66s)]
*  I am just wondering, what are you most worried about? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1618.5800000000002s)]
*  Mostly I think a lot about our own internal execution. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1622.8600000000001s)]
*  So I worry a lot about you get big, you move fast, and you miss some big turn because there [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1626.5600000000002s)]
*  was some internal miss where you took your eye off the ball. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1631.7800000000002s)]
*  So I really try to think about that all the time. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1635.5s)]
*  It's a very different company with 270 million subscribers around the world than it was when [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1638.82s)]
*  I joined with 175,000 subscribers getting DVDs in the US. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1642.9399999999998s)]
*  So how you evolve the company, how you don't get too nostalgic, how you don't be too romantic [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1647.86s)]
*  about the past because the future is so exciting. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1653.6599999999999s)]
*  And I do think that movies and games and television and stand-up comedy, all these things are [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1657.6s)]
*  real art forms. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1663.62s)]
*  Otherwise it's just killing an hour. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1665.1799999999998s)]
*  And then I'd be very worried about TikTok. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1666.78s)]
*  This is not just killing an hour. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1669.34s)]
*  This is entertaining, enlightening, expanding, seeding conversation, all those things. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1670.6799999999998s)]
*  Ted Sarandos, we are going to speak again. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1677.3s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1681.86s)]
*  But I really, really thank you for your time. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1683.46s)]
*  This has been really interesting. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1685.56s)]
*  Thank you, Lulu. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1687.34s)]
*  After the break, I called Ted back to talk about a part of the future that people in [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1691.86s)]
*  Hollywood have more mixed feelings about, AI. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1696.06s)]
*  There's not a scenario, I don't believe, that an AI program is going to write a better screenplay [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1701.06s)]
*  than a great writer or going to replace a great performance or we won't be able to tell the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1706.46s)]
*  difference. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1711.98s)]
*  AI is not going to take your job. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1712.98s)]
*  The person who uses AI well might take your job. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1715.1s)]
*  Hello. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1721.82s)]
*  Hello. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1722.82s)]
*  This is the interview. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1723.82s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1745.98s)]
*  So as you know, the premise for this is we call you back a few days later to sort of [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1748.14s)]
*  talk over maybe things that I've been thinking about, maybe things that you've been thinking [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1753.6200000000001s)]
*  about. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1757.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1758.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering if you had any thoughts from our previous conversation. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1759.6200000000001s)]
*  The thing that stuck with me most was our discussion about film because there's so many [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1762.74s)]
*  ways it captures everything we're trying to do. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1769.2800000000002s)]
*  I feel like our discussion about Irish Wish is a great example of how hard it is because [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1773.2s)]
*  we all have these great contradictions even inside of ourselves. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1779.96s)]
*  I love The Crown and I love Is It Cake? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1784.0800000000002s)]
*  I love them both equally, which doesn't make any sense to both. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1787.64s)]
*  When I think about that and think about all of our people, what are we trying to do? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1790.44s)]
*  We're trying to make movies that are great. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1795.52s)]
*  We define quality from the perspective of the audience. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1798.56s)]
*  So if the audience loves the movie, it's great. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  That's quality. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1804.6000000000001s)]
*  For me, Irish Wish maybe didn't scratch the itch for you, but 65 million people watch [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1806.16s)]
*  that movie. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1812.96s)]
*  That's an enormous hit and people love it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1813.96s)]
*  Critics and reviews, it's a great thing. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1818.64s)]
*  You want to please everybody. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1820.5200000000002s)]
*  But sometimes the movies that we make are not made for critics. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1822.5200000000002s)]
*  So it's kind of a no-brainer. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1825.72s)]
*  The movie might get a bad review because it's not really made for that demographic of a [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1829.72s)]
*  film critic. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1833.4s)]
*  But for the audience that loves it, they love it. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1834.4s)]
*  Well this dovetails very nicely in what I was thinking about after our conversation. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1837.68s)]
*  Because when we spoke, I was sort of pressing you on this question of whether your strategy, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1842.64s)]
*  which is everything for everyone, affects the quality of your programming. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1847.0s)]
*  And you argued, as you just argued, that you can have quality and quantity. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1851.44s)]
*  And you make a good case. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1856.6000000000001s)]
*  So it left me wondering this. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1858.34s)]
*  Discernment is part of any entertainment business. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1860.3s)]
*  So what's not right for Netflix? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1863.58s)]
*  Great question. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1868.3s)]
*  I mean, because I don't think that there's a clean answer. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1869.3s)]
*  Because the best version of something may work really well for Netflix, but it just [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1872.3s)]
*  hasn't worked to date. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1876.66s)]
*  There's some obvious ones. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1878.34s)]
*  Like today we don't do breaking news and that kind of thing because I think there's a lot [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1879.34s)]
*  of other outlets for it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1883.74s)]
*  People aren't looking to us for that. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1884.94s)]
*  And to the extent that On Demand and the distribution channel and the recommendation channel brings [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1887.82s)]
*  a lot of value to the storytelling, that's perfectly in our sweet spot. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1893.46s)]
*  I guess I'm thinking of a Barbie, an Oppenheimer. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1898.62s)]
*  Are there things that just don't feel like they're in your wheelhouse right now? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1903.3s)]
*  I think both of those boofies would be great for Netflix. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1910.1s)]
*  They definitely would have enjoyed just as big an audience on Netflix. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1916.06s)]
*  And so I don't think there's any reason to believe that certain kind of movies do or [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1920.22s)]
*  don't work. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1923.7s)]
*  There's no reason to believe that the size of the screen or that the movie itself for [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1924.7s)]
*  all people is better in any size of screen. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1929.34s)]
*  My son's editor is 28 years old and he watched Lords of Arabia on his phone. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1932.98s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1938.22s)]
*  I got everything on that. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1939.22s)]
*  Oh, that's sacrilege. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1940.22s)]
*  I'm going to shift a little bit because there was something else that I was thinking about. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1942.22s)]
*  I'd love to know from your vantage point how you think about the possible creative tradeoffs [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1949.3s)]
*  and consequences of using AI. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1954.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that AI is a natural kind of advancement of things that are happening in the creative [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1958.18s)]
*  space today anyway. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1963.14s)]
*  I think about volume stages, did not displace on location shooting. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1966.42s)]
*  And I actually think about things like AI as being, I don't think of them as a creative [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1972.54s)]
*  tool in the threatening sense. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1976.6200000000001s)]
*  I think of them as a creator's tool in an enabling sense, ways that filmmakers, writers, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1979.18s)]
*  directors, editors will use AI as a tool to do their jobs better and to do things more [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1985.46s)]
*  efficiently and more effectively. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1990.54s)]
*  And even in the best case, to put things on screen that would be impossible to do. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1992.78s)]
*  So I think this is a creator's tool. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=1999.18s)]
*  Nobody's designed to replace creators with AI. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2002.18s)]
*  It's meant to be a creator's tool to enhance the ability to tell stories better than ever. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2006.78s)]
*  Which I think that's the possibility of it. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2012.58s)]
*  And if we get caught up in all the possible downsides of it and we just get stuck, I don't [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2014.22s)]
*  think that's going to help anything. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2020.02s)]
*  It's very difficult to stop the advancement of new technology. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2021.14s)]
*  And in almost every case, new technology in entertainment has been fought tooth and nail. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2024.38s)]
*  And at the end of the day, improves the business. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2030.5800000000002s)]
*  Think about this gigantic leap in from hand drawn animation to computer generated animation. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2033.98s)]
*  And look how many more people animation employs today than it used to. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2039.8600000000001s)]
*  That business has gotten bigger and better because of these advancements in technology. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2043.94s)]
*  Remember how everybody fought home video. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2048.22s)]
*  And for several couple of decades, the studios wouldn't license movies to television. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2051.3799999999997s)]
*  So every advancement in technology entertainment has been fought and ultimately has turned [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2056.98s)]
*  out to grow the business. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2062.2599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know that this will be any different. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2063.2599999999998s)]
*  I guess the difference might be that all those things were tools that were used to open up [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2065.54s)]
*  the creative space. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2074.98s)]
*  What a lot of people feel is that AI might actually supplant the creators. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2077.82s)]
*  I have more faith in humans than that. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2085.5s)]
*  I really do. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2087.9s)]
*  I think that if you go back, there's a great documentary about the making of Apocalypse [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2088.9s)]
*  Now. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2096.58s)]
*  It's a beautiful movie. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2097.58s)]
*  It's one of my favorite documentaries. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2098.58s)]
*  But in that movie, I don't know what year it came out now. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2100.34s)]
*  And Francis Fricoplo is predicting that some kid in the Midwest is going to make the next [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2104.9s)]
*  great movie because cameras are going to be so cheap. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2109.02s)]
*  And it is true that tools have never been more accessible. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2113.1800000000003s)]
*  And telling a great story could be as simple as taking your phone out and shooting it and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2119.14s)]
*  uploading it to YouTube. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2123.82s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2124.82s)]
*  But I do think if you think about that as a thing to be afraid of, what do you think [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2127.2000000000003s)]
*  about that as an opportunity for how do I do this? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2131.62s)]
*  There's not a scenario, I don't believe, that an AI program is going to write a better screenplay [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2135.06s)]
*  than a great writer or going to replace a great performance or we won't be able to tell [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2140.5s)]
*  the difference. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2145.8199999999997s)]
*  AI is not going to take your job. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2146.8199999999997s)]
*  The person who uses AI well might take your job. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2149.14s)]
*  Before we go, we've been talking about all the ways the industry is changing and Netflix [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2152.5s)]
*  is growing. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2161.5s)]
*  I'm wondering, is it possible for Netflix to get too big? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2162.5s)]
*  You know, it's a very broad space. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2168.94s)]
*  So like you said, we're, look how long we've been at this and look how I think I'm very [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2170.98s)]
*  proud of what the teams do. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2175.86s)]
*  And we're 10% of what happens on a connected television today. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2177.9s)]
*  But when I think about how people have how we divide time between video games, social [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2181.48s)]
*  user generated content, all the other studios, all the other television broadcasts, all the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2188.18s)]
*  sporting events. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2192.98s)]
*  So you've got so many things you're competing for that the opportunity to be dominant is [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2194.66s)]
*  almost very difficult. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2199.4199999999996s)]
*  And that's not the goal. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2201.7s)]
*  The goal is to be the best. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o&t=2202.7s)]
