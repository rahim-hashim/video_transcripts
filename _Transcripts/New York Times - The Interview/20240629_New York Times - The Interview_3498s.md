# 'The Interview': Eddie Murphy Is Ready to Look Back
**New York Times - The Interview:** [June 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=6.16s)]
*  Eddie Murphy has been so famous for so long that it can be easy to take for granted or [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=9.36s)]
*  just plain overlook how game-changing a figure he actually is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  As a stand-up, he was a total rock star. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=20.48s)]
*  Eddie Murphy Raw from 1987 is the highest grossing stand-up comedy film ever released. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And he brought that sheer comedic firepower to TV too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=29.4s)]
*  At the risk of overstating it, and I don't think I am, he can take pretty much sole credit [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=32.8s)]
*  for rescuing Saturday Night Live from its early 80s slump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=37.28s)]
*  But he made his greatest mark in movies, where he became one of the biggest stars of all [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=41.12s)]
*  time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=44.72s)]
*  He reached new heights of popularity and bankability, especially for a comedian and especially for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=45.72s)]
*  a black actor. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=50.84s)]
*  He pioneered the action comedy genre with movies like Beverly Hills Cop and 48 Hours. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=52.4s)]
*  And later he made classics out of family-friendly films too, like The Nutty Professor and Shrek [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=57.08s)]
*  movies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=61.08s)]
*  Simply put, there is American pop culture before Eddie Murphy and American pop culture [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=62.8s)]
*  after Eddie Murphy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=67.96s)]
*  And now he's returning to the character that sent his career to overdrive with Beverly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=70.32s)]
*  Hills Cop Axel F. It comes 40 years after the first film in the series, and Murphy is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=73.84s)]
*  back as the wisecracking detective Axel Foley. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=79.48s)]
*  In recent years, Murphy's been a somewhat remote and enigmatic off-screen presence. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=83.02s)]
*  But as I found out over the course of our two conversations, now is a good moment for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=89.1s)]
*  Murphy to reflect on what he's accomplished, spin some Hollywood stories, explain why stand-up [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  doesn't appeal to him anymore, and reveal the dream project he's never been able to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=98.06s)]
*  get off the ground. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=102.42s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Eddie Murphy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=103.42s)]
*  And just a heads up here, big surprise, this episode has some pretty salty language in it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=106.62s)]
*  You've been around working professionally for, it's got to be close to 50 years if you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=114.02s)]
*  include starting at stand-up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=119.58s)]
*  And I think because you've been around for so long and been successful for so long, people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=122.86s)]
*  might take for granted just sort of how unprecedented your success was. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=129.82s)]
*  Like when all that was happening and things were skyrocketing, like around the time of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=134.94s)]
*  the first Beverly Hills Cop, which I guess after 48 hours, you know, did you feel like [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=140.34s)]
*  you as a comedian, as a movie star, as a black movie star, understood what it was about you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=144.86s)]
*  specifically that met the moment so perfectly? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  No, and not even in retrospect. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=157.54s)]
*  I'm 22 when I had to do Beverly Hills Cop. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=160.34s)]
*  And I'm 20 years old when I started doing 48 hours. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=165.54s)]
*  Now I look back on those times and I trip about how young I was. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=170.06s)]
*  Back then, I kind of took it for granted. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=174.2s)]
*  This is just stuff that was happening and one thing had led to another. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  And I wound up on a movie set and I just went with it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=181.2s)]
*  And then when stuff worked and became hit movies, I was like, okay, yeah, that's what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  it's supposed to be, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=191.56s)]
*  I realize now, I was like, wow, that was a trip that it came together like that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=192.88s)]
*  And then I guess I kind of took it for granted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=199.8s)]
*  What do you think it meant for you for stuff to be blowing up the way it did? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=202.24s)]
*  You said you took it for granted, which in retrospect, that's a crazy, it's like you're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=206.56s)]
*  becoming the biggest movie star in the world, the biggest comedian. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=210.24s)]
*  Like, this seems like it's going how it should. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=212.84s)]
*  It seems as if that would be something that could kind of be hard for someone to reconcile [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=215.7s)]
*  with who they are in some ways, because even at that age, you're still figuring out who [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=221.84s)]
*  you are, you know? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=224.98s)]
*  I knew, I started maybe around 13, 14, I started saying that I was going to be famous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=225.98s)]
*  You know, I tell my mother, when I'm famous, yada yada, and I was always, so when I got [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=233.82s)]
*  famous, it was like, I told you I was going to be famous. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=238.38s)]
*  Now, I didn't know how big it was going to get and I knew I was going to get famous. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=241.66s)]
*  I was having, you know, like these famous people that I grew up watching on television [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=245.66s)]
*  wanted to have a meal with me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=251.38s)]
*  After 48 hours, Marlon Brando calls my agent and wants to meet me and I go to Marlon Brando's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=254.78s)]
*  house and have dinner with Marlon Brando. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=260.5s)]
*  I was like, okay, I guess that's what happens. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=263.42s)]
*  Now, at this age, I look back and go, wow, that's fucking crazy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=266.98s)]
*  The whole idea that your first movie, the greatest actor of all times wants to have [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=271.14s)]
*  dinner with you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=276.06s)]
*  I went and hung out with him a few times. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=277.06s)]
*  But back then, I just thought, oh, that's the way it is. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  You make a movie and Marlon Brando calls. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=281.9s)]
*  Do you remember that dinner? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=284.46s)]
*  He sees it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=285.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm fascinated by Marlon Brando. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=286.46s)]
*  The very first time we were supposed to meet was at the L'Hermitage in Los Angeles. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=289.02s)]
*  He came to the hotel and we had dinner at the top place, at the restaurant on the top. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=294.82s)]
*  Then the second time was at his house and he came and picked me up at the hotel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=301.82s)]
*  I thought that it was at eight o'clock. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=306.46s)]
*  It was a time mix up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=307.98s)]
*  I came down like a half hour late and he was waiting for me in the car. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=308.98s)]
*  Brando was just sitting waiting for me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=313.3s)]
*  We went to his house on Mulholland. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=315.34s)]
*  I was just going on and on about the Godfather. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=318.3s)]
*  He didn't even want to talk about the Godfather. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=322.02s)]
*  He was like, Godfather. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=324.9s)]
*  He was like, not just a Godfather, acting. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=326.38s)]
*  He was like, acting is bullshit. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  Everybody can act and so and so. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=332.3s)]
*  This is how long ago this was. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=334.94s)]
*  He was going and that kid, I can't stand that kid with the gun. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=337.34s)]
*  I was like, what kid with the gun? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=341.82s)]
*  He's on the poster. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=343.38s)]
*  He's got the guy that was like, Clint Eastwood? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=344.82s)]
*  Yeah, that guy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  Clint was like, that's how long ago it was. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=349.3s)]
*  He was calling Clint Eastwood that kid. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=350.74s)]
*  Clint Eastwood was 93 years old. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=355.02s)]
*  That's how long ago it was. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=356.78s)]
*  Are there folks that you see coming up and you think, I'm curious about this person? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=359.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm around Brando's age like he was when he wanted me. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=364.86s)]
*  Is there some 20-year-old that's on the scene that I'm like calling my agent going, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=367.74s)]
*  oh, absolutely not. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=372.7s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=377.02s)]
*  I'm so out of touch. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=378.1s)]
*  I used to be so hip. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=379.14s)]
*  I used to know who everybody was. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=380.14s)]
*  And now there's just so much stuff. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=381.82s)]
*  I asked my wife, who's this person? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=384.1s)]
*  They'd be like, oh, that song's the biggest thing in the world. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=385.66s)]
*  I don't even know what's going on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=388.38s)]
*  You know, I just watched, there's a really good conversation with you and Jerry Seinfeld. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=391.78s)]
*  It was for some Netflix event. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=397.9s)]
*  And I think in that, you describe yourself as fundamentally, you think of yourself as a comedian. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=399.94s)]
*  And fundamentally, me personally think of myself as a comedian. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=406.62s)]
*  I said that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=411.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=411.7s)]
*  Does that sound wrong? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=412.98s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't think of myself as a comedian at all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=414.02s)]
*  I think myself as a comedian. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=417.46s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=418.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's one aspect of who I am, that I'm a comedian. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=419.70000000000005s)]
*  I see myself as an artist. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=425.74s)]
*  I'm a super sensitive artist. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=430.62s)]
*  And I can dabble. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  I can express myself creatively in a bunch of different ways. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=435.54s)]
*  Like I play a musician. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=440.62s)]
*  And I write screenplays. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=442.86s)]
*  And I sing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=444.74s)]
*  I'm funny. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=447.38s)]
*  I just do a bunch of stuff. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=448.73999999999995s)]
*  I don't just go, oh, I'm a comedian. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  Comedian is one part of it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean when you say you describe yourself as a super sensitive artist? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=455.82s)]
*  Like I can pick up energy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  I can tell if somebody's got something going on under their skin while I'm talking to them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=464.17999999999995s)]
*  I can feel that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=469.14s)]
*  I'm super sensitive. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  If I walk in a room, I could tell who's getting ready to come over here [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  and say something, and who's trying to act like they don't care that I'm there. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=477.94s)]
*  I feel all of that shit. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  That's why I hate going to award shows. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=485.1s)]
*  The most horrible energy in the world is a room full of famous people going through [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  that whole famous thing, and who's the most famous, and who's cool, and all of that energy [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=493.5s)]
*  going on, everybody acting. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=500.58s)]
*  I hate that feeling. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=503.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=506.38s)]
*  Just to go back to what I was trying to lead towards with the Seinfeld thing, where I understand [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=508.46s)]
*  fundamentally you're an artist and not a comedian, but I think the context was he was nudging [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=514.74s)]
*  you and the moderator was nudging you, like, when are you going to do stand-up? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=519.62s)]
*  Which I think people ask you all the time, when are you going to go back to do stand-up? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=523.38s)]
*  That's a comic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=526.3s)]
*  I'm not a comic. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=527.3s)]
*  I still do funny things and I write funny stuff, but I haven't been a comic since I [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=528.5s)]
*  was 27. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=534.1s)]
*  Is that something that's still appealing to you in any fashion? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=535.94s)]
*  It's a whole different world now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  I used to have little periods where I'd be like, I'm going to do it again. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  Then I'd be like, why? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=547.86s)]
*  The closest I got to doing it again was right before the pandemic. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=549.86s)]
*  I actually was like, I'm going to do stand-up again, because I did Saturday Night Live and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=553.6600000000001s)]
*  I was like, let me go back and since I did SNL, let me go do one stand-up special and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=557.46s)]
*  bring it all full circle. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=563.7s)]
*  Then the pandemic hit and we were stuck in the house for two years. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  I wasn't going, oh, when I get out of here, I want to do stand-up again. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=572.5400000000001s)]
*  It was like, and now it's, here's a good analogy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=575.34s)]
*  It's like somebody that was in the military and they were on the front line in Vietnam [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=580.5s)]
*  or whatever and they got all these medals because they did all this amazing stuff, but [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  then they moved up and they became a general in the army. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=591.9s)]
*  So it's like going to the general and saying, hey, you ever think about going back to the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=595.94s)]
*  front line? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=599.9s)]
*  Will have Buller's Whiz pass your ear again? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=602.9s)]
*  It's like, no, it's much easier just doing this. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=604.98s)]
*  Do you have a dream project? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=611.58s)]
*  Like if you could snap your fingers and knew it was going to happen, what is the movie [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=612.94s)]
*  that Eddie Murphy would want to make? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=618.2s)]
*  Oh gee, I don't know. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=621.02s)]
*  I don't have like a dream project. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't have something that I was sitting around for years. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, actually I do have things like that, but they're not, I don't know if they would [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=628.9s)]
*  ever get made. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=636.02s)]
*  They're like things, crazy ideas that I had. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=637.02s)]
*  This one thing I've been threatening to do through maybe 20 years called Soul, Soul, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=643.62s)]
*  it's like this fake documentary that I love and everybody, whenever I show people a material [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=649.58s)]
*  on it, I'll show people a character. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  We shot like this fake trailer and everything. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=658.7s)]
*  They were like, hey, when are you going to make this movie? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=660.66s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=662.46s)]
*  I want to make it, but I just can't figure out how to do it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=663.78s)]
*  What would the fake documentary be about? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=668.66s)]
*  It's about this guy who it's kind of like zealot kind of thing about it where it's this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=670.62s)]
*  guy who was part of the rock and roll and R&B thing back in the 60s and did all the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=677.3s)]
*  most and the biggest and worked with everybody. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=684.78s)]
*  We never heard of him, but all those great moments in rock and roll and he's attached [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=688.02s)]
*  to all of these things. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=693.06s)]
*  He's this bitter artist. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=693.9799999999999s)]
*  And yeah, where's my phone? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=696.42s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to break in here to explain what exactly is going on. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=702.1s)]
*  So Eddie pulls out his phone and starts looking for something on it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=707.5s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=710.7s)]
*  Where is Soul, Soul, Soul? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=712.9s)]
*  And then for the next three and a half minutes, Eddie Murphy holds the phone up to his computer [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=715.5s)]
*  camera and shows me this trailer for a movie that doesn't exist. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=720.74s)]
*  Okay, so he has 200 gold records sold 35. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=724.78s)]
*  He has 35 Grammys, six lifetime achievement awards. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  You're showing me a video. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=737.78s)]
*  He's been inducted into the Soul Music Hall of Fame twice. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=739.1s)]
*  The world knows him by a single, a double name. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  Murray Murray. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  If you got a record player, you know Murray Murray. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=749.78s)]
*  I can sing before I can talk. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=752.82s)]
*  And the humor here, most of it is delivered in documentary style talking head confessionals. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=754.82s)]
*  And it's classic Eddie Murphy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=760.82s)]
*  I remember the first girl I had intercourse with. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=762.82s)]
*  Oh, who was that? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=764.82s)]
*  It's a little woman named Daisy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=765.82s)]
*  And how old were you? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=767.82s)]
*  I was nine and she was 37. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=769.82s)]
*  I have a dream that one day. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=772.82s)]
*  I coined the phrase I have a dream before Martin Luther King. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=775.82s)]
*  I have a dream. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=779.82s)]
*  It's like this. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=780.82s)]
*  It's gonna be the name of a album I have a dream of. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=781.82s)]
*  He liked the way that flow with a good look. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=783.82s)]
*  Then he took that and run with it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=786.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=788.82s)]
*  How much of this have you made? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=791.82s)]
*  It's almost over. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=793.82s)]
*  I can't cry my mom. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=794.82s)]
*  That's where my soul lies. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=795.82s)]
*  I keep watching. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=796.82s)]
*  He contracted soulitis. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=797.82s)]
*  Soulitis. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=799.82s)]
*  You name it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=800.82s)]
*  I can crack the soulitis. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=801.82s)]
*  And that comes from singing soul for too long. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=802.82s)]
*  My doctor told me if I sang another note I could die. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=805.82s)]
*  He told me I'm one note away from dying. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=807.82s)]
*  It's the worst case of soulitis. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=809.82s)]
*  That's how James Rand died. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=810.82s)]
*  Soulitis. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=812.82s)]
*  Oh, it's written too. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=813.82s)]
*  They say it was a plane crash. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=814.82s)]
*  Soulitis. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=815.82s)]
*  You get the idea. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=818.82s)]
*  And like I said, this went on for a while. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=819.82s)]
*  So let's skip to the end and get back to the interview. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=822.82s)]
*  Soul, soul, soul, the Murray Murray story. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=824.82s)]
*  Pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=828.82s)]
*  Yeah, so that's that's probably about 10 years old now. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=834.82s)]
*  Well, I'd see that movie. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=840.82s)]
*  Yeah, but we haven't been. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=843.82s)]
*  I'm telling you, I almost made this movie a bunch of times. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=844.82s)]
*  I've been right to where I was going to make it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=848.82s)]
*  And then it's, yeah, no, not right now. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=850.82s)]
*  I feel like it's so self-indulgent and I feel like only a few people would go see it, but they would laugh so fucking hard. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=852.82s)]
*  When you're home and not working on stuff, you know, not making music or not writing, what's an ideal day for you? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=859.82s)]
*  Nothing. I like to do nothing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=867.82s)]
*  I like a day where there's nothing and my kids, I can hear my kids, you know, wherever they at, it's just quiet. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=869.82s)]
*  I sit around and play guitar. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=878.82s)]
*  The ideal day for me is nothing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=881.82s)]
*  Was it always like that? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=883.82s)]
*  Yeah, when I was a little boy, when we were getting in trouble, the punishment for my brothers were that they couldn't go outside. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=886.82s)]
*  And when I got in trouble, the punishment was I couldn't watch TV. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=895.82s)]
*  I could go outside, but instead I would be sitting in the house crying because I couldn't watch TV. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=899.82s)]
*  I loved to watch TV. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=904.82s)]
*  My whole life was a TV watcher. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=906.82s)]
*  Cut school and take the blanket and put it over the dining room table and take the TV and put it under the table and have like a little tent under there and have my little junk food and just watch TV. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=908.82s)]
*  It's always been a homebody. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=921.82s)]
*  What do you watch now, anything? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=924.82s)]
*  I'm ashamed to say what I stuff that I watch now. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=926.82s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=929.82s)]
*  It's not hip stuff. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=930.82s)]
*  You know, I watch every night. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=936.82s)]
*  I'm not ashamed to say it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=938.82s)]
*  I watch every night at six o'clock when I eat dinner. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=939.82s)]
*  I watch Steve Harvey and Family Feud. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=944.82s)]
*  And on Tuesdays, I watch The Masked Singer. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=947.82s)]
*  We do. My wife and I, we watch all those shows, the singing competitions and that kind of stuff. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=955.82s)]
*  I'd be like, now you ain't even supposed to be watching no shit like this. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=961.82s)]
*  Then you'd be, you say, I wonder who that turtle is. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=965.82s)]
*  I should pull you in. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=968.82s)]
*  You'd be wondering who it is. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=969.82s)]
*  Last year, I watched All of the Golden Bachelor. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=972.82s)]
*  Hey, they broke up too. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=981.82s)]
*  You know they broke up? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=982.82s)]
*  I know. Just recently. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=983.82s)]
*  Three months later, I watched this shit. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=985.82s)]
*  I was like, this is so nice. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=987.82s)]
*  They found love in the second part of their life. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=989.82s)]
*  This is a nice show. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=991.82s)]
*  Bravo. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=993.82s)]
*  Then they finally broke up three months later. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=994.82s)]
*  The same old shit. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=996.82s)]
*  Wait, I'm thinking of this because it's related to when you described yourself as sensitive. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=998.82s)]
*  You know, I remember this is probably- [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1006.82s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1008.82s)]
*  I'm very sensitive. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1009.82s)]
*  What do you watch? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1010.82s)]
*  Family Feud and The Masked Singer. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1011.82s)]
*  Golden Bachelor. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1014.82s)]
*  That's how sensitive you are. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1015.82s)]
*  As you know, I'm a very sensitive artist. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1017.82s)]
*  Really? So what do you watch? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1019.82s)]
*  Family Feud. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1021.82s)]
*  Wait, let me compose myself. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1029.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay, yes. So you're a sensitive artist. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1030.8200000000002s)]
*  I was thinking about just the other day, it popped into my mind how- [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1032.8200000000002s)]
*  It was around the time of the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary show. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1037.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't know if- [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1041.8200000000002s)]
*  You don't seem like a guy who was on Twitter, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1042.8200000000002s)]
*  but Norm MacDonald posted this big story about how they were trying to get you to be on a Celebrity Jeopardy sketch [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1044.8200000000002s)]
*  for the 40th Anniversary show. You didn't want to do it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1050.82s)]
*  But the thing he said that was interesting to me, or most interesting, was, you know, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1052.82s)]
*  it's like everyone knew it would kill, but you know, for whatever reason, you didn't want to do it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1056.82s)]
*  And the thing that Norm then said was, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1062.82s)]
*  Eddie doesn't need the laughs the way that the rest of us need the laughs. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1064.82s)]
*  What is your relationship to the audience? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1071.82s)]
*  Do you feel like you need something from them on any level? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1073.82s)]
*  No. The audience- I never even take the audience into consideration. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1079.82s)]
*  I'm like, this is what I'm doing, this is what it is, and here. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1085.82s)]
*  And if the audience likes it, great. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1089.82s)]
*  And if they don't like it, you know, I'm onto it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1091.82s)]
*  Everything is it for everybody, and I move on. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1093.82s)]
*  A lot of comedians started out as, you know, kind of like the outsider type person [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1096.82s)]
*  who used their sense of humor to, you know, become an insider, become cool. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1101.82s)]
*  And I was never like, I graduated most popular boy. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1107.82s)]
*  I was a popular kid. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1112.82s)]
*  And because I was funny, I was always like a really popular guy and stuff. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1114.82s)]
*  And I wasn't the, I'm not the needy, needy comic. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1119.82s)]
*  And they were always laughing from the very beginning. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1123.82s)]
*  The very first time I heard a crowd of people laugh was on a bus [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1126.82s)]
*  coming from a Karen Poole in Brooklyn. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1130.82s)]
*  And we're in the back of the bus, I might be like eight, nine years old. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1133.82s)]
*  And when a person would get off a bus, I would do like the voice that that person is saying [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1141.82s)]
*  when they got off the bus. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1147.82s)]
*  And I was in the back doing it loud. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1148.82s)]
*  So if a guy would look like a cop when he got off the bus, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1150.82s)]
*  I would start saying like a cop's voice, and I'm going to do something. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1153.82s)]
*  And the people on the bus were laughing. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1156.82s)]
*  Every time a person got off the bus, people were laughing. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1158.82s)]
*  I was like, okay, what was he going to do now? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1162.82s)]
*  And I did it all. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1164.82s)]
*  And when I got off the bus, the whole bus clapped. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1165.82s)]
*  So, oh, yay. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1168.82s)]
*  I was like eight, nine years old. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1170.82s)]
*  That was the first time I was like, why can't make a crowd of people laugh? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1172.82s)]
*  And then I was just that guy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1175.82s)]
*  So I never went through that period where you're trying to find, you know, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1177.82s)]
*  what's funny about me and trying to get laughs and the bombing and all that shit. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1180.82s)]
*  I didn't go through all of that. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1184.82s)]
*  They were laughing from the beginning. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1186.82s)]
*  So I never, I was never a needy, needy comedian. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1187.82s)]
*  You know, you said you kind of always had the audience's approval. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1191.82s)]
*  You didn't have the needy comic thing. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1195.82s)]
*  But at some point, does the money become like the symbolic thing [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1197.82s)]
*  that shows your status in the world? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1203.82s)]
*  You said the money showed my status? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1206.82s)]
*  Yeah, like the money that you were getting from Hollywood, you know? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1208.82s)]
*  It's like, oh, this other person made this amount of dollars. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1211.82s)]
*  I got to make this or, you know, just the way you were with them. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1215.82s)]
*  No, I didn't have that either. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1218.82s)]
*  After 48 hours, Paramount gave me some five-picture deal. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1220.82s)]
*  And at the time, it was like crazy, like some five-picture deal for, you know, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1226.82s)]
*  I think it was $15 million. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1231.82s)]
*  And to us, that was like, I was set for life. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1233.82s)]
*  So I wasn't, I was never like, I've never been, I've never been competitive. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1237.82s)]
*  I've never been, oh, I got to try to outdo what they did. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1242.82s)]
*  All I wanted to do when I started doing comedy, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1246.82s)]
*  I knew I was going to be famous, but all I wanted to do creatively was meet Richard Pryor [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1249.82s)]
*  and be funny to him. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1254.82s)]
*  When I was on a fucking plane coming from Georgia, Richard Pryor was on the plane. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1257.82s)]
*  That's when I first met him. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1262.82s)]
*  And I gave him my cassette of my first album. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1263.82s)]
*  And I sat like two, three rows on the other side, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1267.82s)]
*  and I was watching the back of his head, and he was laughing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1270.82s)]
*  He was laughing at my stuff. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1273.82s)]
*  And that was, I could have died right there. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1276.82s)]
*  You could have crashed the plane right there. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1279.82s)]
*  I would have been like, that was it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1281.82s)]
*  To make Richard laugh, I made Richard laugh for real. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1283.82s)]
*  You don't see Richard laugh a lot. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1286.82s)]
*  Think about it, you never see Richard's real laugh. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1288.82s)]
*  It was Richard Pryor on the plane laughing. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1291.82s)]
*  He laughed like this. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1295.82s)]
*  That's a Richard Pryor laugh when he really laughs. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1296.82s)]
*  But then he gave you a hard time later on. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1306.82s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1308.82s)]
*  When did Richard Pryor give me a hard time? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1309.82s)]
*  Bill Cosby gave me a hard time. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1311.82s)]
*  I thought Richard Pryor kind of gave you some attitude, because he was competitive. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1313.82s)]
*  What Bill Cosby gave you a hard time about? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1317.82s)]
*  About language and all that shit. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1319.82s)]
*  Richard Pryor was always, that's a myth. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1321.82s)]
*  Because I've heard people say before that Eddie and Richard Pryor didn't get along. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1325.82s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1328.82s)]
*  Richard Pryor was, he didn't become like a mentor or anybody, but he was my idol. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1329.82s)]
*  My idols were Richard Pryor, Muhammad Ali, Bruce Lee, and Elvis Presley. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1336.82s)]
*  And I met Richard Pryor and Muhammad Ali, and they were wonderful to me. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1343.82s)]
*  When we landed from that flight from Atlanta, Richard was like, which way are you going? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1348.82s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to say, oh, he drove me home to the place I was staying. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1353.82s)]
*  He was always cool with me. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1359.82s)]
*  But Richard is old enough to be my dad, and Richard had substance problems and alcohol. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1361.82s)]
*  He had all these demons and stuff. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1368.82s)]
*  We had nothing in common outside of the fact that we were both funny. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1370.82s)]
*  The craziest thing about Bill Cosby giving you a hard time about language? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1375.82s)]
*  Language was a way that he could come at it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1379.82s)]
*  It wasn't so much language, it was the times that we were in. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1381.82s)]
*  This is back when it was, you know, one black person at a time was getting in the mix. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1385.82s)]
*  So when I come on the scene, Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby are like, oh, this is the new shit that's coming on. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1390.82s)]
*  So if there's some new thing coming on, that's a threat to whatever their thing is. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1398.82s)]
*  So that's what Bill Cosby had. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1403.82s)]
*  Richard Pryor could look at me and see I was, oh, well, he's my reflection. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1404.82s)]
*  That kid is trying to be like me. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1409.82s)]
*  So he wasn't threatened. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1411.82s)]
*  Bill Cosby was like, is this the new way it's going to be now? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1413.82s)]
*  They're going to be on stage grabbing their dick and talking crazy and all that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1416.82s)]
*  So he could come at me with all the language, but it was more, you know, it's one at a time. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1420.82s)]
*  And is this the new guy? He's going to knock me out the spot. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1425.82s)]
*  That's what was going on back then. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1428.82s)]
*  So they were competitive in that respect. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1429.82s)]
*  I wasn't even thinking about them like that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1432.82s)]
*  I was puppy dogging both of them when I met them. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1434.82s)]
*  Did you ever see a performer, an artist afterwards that made you think, whoa, this is like I have to wrap my head around this a little bit? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1437.82s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1445.82s)]
*  In the same way that like you just described Cosby and Pryor being like, oh, Eddie Murphy's the new stuff. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1446.82s)]
*  We have to like reckon with that. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1451.82s)]
*  Was there ever anybody that you saw that made you feel like, huh, I got to understand what this person's doing? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1453.82s)]
*  Oh, you mean like someone that came after me, they went to the next level and I was like, oh, no, never. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1460.82s)]
*  No, I haven't seen that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1466.82s)]
*  And that's a lot of people that I think are funny and all that, but I haven't, I haven't witnessed the next level. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1469.82s)]
*  The ceiling of the whole art form, you know, stand up comedy, you know, that's Richard. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1479.82s)]
*  And the ceiling for, you know, with movies and stuff is for me is Chaplin. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1486.82s)]
*  And I haven't seen anyone come along that was better than Chaplin. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1492.82s)]
*  What do you take from him? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1496.82s)]
*  I haven't taken anything from Chaplin. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1499.82s)]
*  The only time I've ever tried to be like somebody on screen was Bruce Lee. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1502.82s)]
*  People forget how big Bruce Lee was when I was a kid. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1511.82s)]
*  To this day, I've never seen anyone have, make the audience have a reaction like Bruce Lee would do. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1516.82s)]
*  When Bruce Lee movies, we would go crazy. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1522.82s)]
*  Bruce Lee is the only time I've been in a movie where they stopped the movie and the projectionists would come out and say, listen, y'all got to shut up and sit down. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1524.82s)]
*  And we can't show the movie. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1533.82s)]
*  They have to tell the audience to sit down and come. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1534.82s)]
*  Bruce Lee would drive us crazy. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1537.82s)]
*  And now to this day, when I pull a gun out, I'm doing a Bruce Lee impression. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1539.82s)]
*  That whole intense, whatever faces I'm making and all that shit is all doing my Bruce Lee looks. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1543.82s)]
*  I always wondered if Elvis was secretly the influence behind some of the onstage stuff you wore when you were doing stand up. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1552.82s)]
*  Elvis had a huge influence on me. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1560.82s)]
*  The leather suits and raw, I come out, I have a scarf. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1562.82s)]
*  And I was rolling like Elvis too. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1566.82s)]
*  When we was on the road, I had a crew and I had the Memphis mafia, but I had my little crew of dudes. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1568.82s)]
*  It was the whole shit. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1574.82s)]
*  And I used to dress the same way you see me dressed in Delirious. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1576.82s)]
*  I used to really dress like that on the streets. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1579.82s)]
*  That was totally in my Elvis trip. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1582.82s)]
*  Then when I got older, I was like, oh my God, Elvis wasn't cool at all. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1587.82s)]
*  Elvis was going through some shit. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1592.82s)]
*  Now, Michael, that whole red jacket thing in Thriller after Delirious went out in a red suit and all that shit. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1595.82s)]
*  I'm not saying he was influenced, but I had on a red jacket before. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1602.82s)]
*  But you're not saying. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1608.82s)]
*  But you know Elvis, you just mentioned Michael Jackson. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1610.82s)]
*  These guys who really achieve the apex of fame. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1614.82s)]
*  Prince is another guy like that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1619.82s)]
*  I think there really was a period where it felt like you were entering that level of phenomenon status. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1622.82s)]
*  Not just a star, but the biggest kind of star. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1629.82s)]
*  Yeah, I went through all of that. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1632.82s)]
*  And those guys I just mentioned, they all kind of came to tragic ends. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1635.82s)]
*  And you realize that fame can't solve anyone's problems, but it can really cause problems. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1640.82s)]
*  Do you feel like you understand the pressures that present themselves to people at that level of fame that leads to their lives getting so kind of warped in a way? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1646.82s)]
*  Do you feel like you have a perspective on that? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1658.82s)]
*  Those guys are all cautionary tales for me. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1663.82s)]
*  I don't drink. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1667.82s)]
*  I smoked a joint for the first time when I was 30 years old. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1669.82s)]
*  That's the extent of drugs is some weed. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1673.82s)]
*  I remember I was 19. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1676.82s)]
*  I went to the blues bar. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1680.82s)]
*  It was me, Belushi and Robin Williams. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1682.82s)]
*  They to coke out, start doing coke. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1684.82s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm cool. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1686.82s)]
*  And every now and then over the years, I trip about that moment because I was really young and it was so easy to try some coke. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1688.82s)]
*  I wasn't taking some moral stance, but I just wasn't interested in it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1697.82s)]
*  And to not have the desire or the curiosity of it, that say that's Providence. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1701.82s)]
*  God was looking over me in that moment where I didn't make a left turn and just everything would have been different. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1706.82s)]
*  So it's really when you get famous really young, especially a black artist, I liken it to it's like living in a minefield. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1715.82s)]
*  At any moment you step on a step on a mine, any moment something could happen that can undo everything. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1728.82s)]
*  And but I was oblivious to the fact that I was in a minefield. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1735.82s)]
*  I did the you ever see Apocalypse Now? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1739.82s)]
*  Of course. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1742.82s)]
*  I remember the Robert Duvall character and bombs are dropping next to him. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1743.82s)]
*  He didn't see it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1748.82s)]
*  That's what my life was like. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1749.82s)]
*  It was like all of this stuff is going on. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1751.82s)]
*  Bomb and it's totally oblivious. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1754.82s)]
*  It's like walking through a minefield and not even realizing you were in one. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1756.82s)]
*  And now this age I can look back and be like, wow, I came through a minefield for 35 years and even. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1761.82s)]
*  Well, how do you make it through a minefield for 35, 40 years? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1768.82s)]
*  Something has to be looking over you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1772.82s)]
*  Why did you say especially for black artists? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1775.82s)]
*  What do you see as the difference there? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1777.82s)]
*  First of all, this business, it's not set up for a black artist. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1779.82s)]
*  You know, it was a new thing when I was like, OK, the black artist is usually the sidekick. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1784.82s)]
*  You know, the black artist has the leading man and it's in a big movie that's watched all around the world. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1790.82s)]
*  So it was like I'm doing this stuff that no one's ever done. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1797.82s)]
*  And it's in a business that's not set up for me. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1800.82s)]
*  It's set up for the white some white dude to be. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1804.82s)]
*  And so you don't have people watching your back and you don't have support groups. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1806.82s)]
*  You have any of that shit. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1811.82s)]
*  You just kind of ended. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1812.82s)]
*  You don't have anybody you can go to and say, hey, what about this? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1813.82s)]
*  Well, you don't have any of that. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1816.82s)]
*  You know, so you kind of was just in it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1817.82s)]
*  And what were the bombs? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1820.82s)]
*  Just everything. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1822.82s)]
*  Imagine just imagine being a young person and having the world placed at your feet. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1823.82s)]
*  Nobody's saying no. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1830.82s)]
*  And everybody wants to be around you. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1831.82s)]
*  You try all types of shit and get caught up in all kinds of stuff. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1834.82s)]
*  That's what destroys people. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1838.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1841.82s)]
*  Well, you tried pot for the first time when you were 30. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1843.82s)]
*  Yeah, I was 30 years old. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1846.82s)]
*  I was in this recording studio and everybody had left. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1848.82s)]
*  And it was some everybody's to smoke all the time. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1852.82s)]
*  It was a joint there. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1855.82s)]
*  Well, a friend of mine, David and his wife, Donna, were there. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1856.82s)]
*  And so you see what it all is. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1860.82s)]
*  And I took a hit on a joint. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1862.82s)]
*  And I said, OK. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1864.82s)]
*  And then with some jelly belly jelly beans, those gourmet jelly beans. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1868.82s)]
*  And I remember taking the jelly beans and eating one and trying to guess with my eyes closed which flavor it was. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1872.82s)]
*  And we were just screaming with laughter and was like, oh, now I see. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1877.82s)]
*  Now I get it. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1881.82s)]
*  There's all of that shit. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1883.82s)]
*  So it was it was it was cool in the beginning. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1884.82s)]
*  This is sort of a random question. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1888.82s)]
*  But, you know, I just rewatched Bowfinger, which is the Hollywood, you know, the Hollywood satire you made late night. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1891.82s)]
*  Which for my money is your best performance in a movie. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1897.82s)]
*  And better than Nutty Professor. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1902.82s)]
*  Well, I like I like Bowfinger more. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1906.82s)]
*  Yes. But for me, there's no comparison. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1908.82s)]
*  But I like Bowfinger. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1911.82s)]
*  But Nutty Professor, the mother and that stuff is real. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1912.82s)]
*  Those make ups that Rick Baker did and they turn you into another person. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1918.82s)]
*  You told there's no sign of me. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1923.82s)]
*  I could walk in a room and person wouldn't even know I was me. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1925.82s)]
*  I think that's my best acting. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1929.82s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1931.82s)]
*  I like Bowfinger, but I could think of 20 other actors that could have played that role. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1933.82s)]
*  I can't think of another person that could do Nutty Professor. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1939.82s)]
*  But Bowfinger, you do the multiple roles, too. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1943.82s)]
*  Not quite the same. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1946.82s)]
*  But a lot of people could do that. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1948.82s)]
*  But the question I had about it was, you know, it's to do with the idea of the challenge of the material. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1951.82s)]
*  I thought watching Bowfinger, you know, you're doing the nerdy character, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1958.82s)]
*  then you're doing the action film character, and you're playing opposite Steve Martin. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1962.82s)]
*  And it just seemed like that role was probably, you know, presented a particular challenge. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1967.82s)]
*  And Nutty Professor, too, what you just described, having to inhabit all these different characters. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1972.82s)]
*  When you say challenge, what do you mean challenge? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1977.82s)]
*  Like, both the challenge of playing the different roles and playing them credibly, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1980.82s)]
*  and the tonal challenge of doing the comedy that, you know, it's also sort of a pretty dark satire in some ways. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1987.82s)]
*  And then also, I imagine just the sort of like the competitive challenge of then acting opposite another sort of comedy legend like Steve Martin. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=1995.82s)]
*  But then, you know, the challenges... [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2007.82s)]
*  I don't see them as... I don't gravitate towards things that I think would be challenging. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2009.82s)]
*  This is my question. Yes. Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2014.82s)]
*  I don't think if something feels challenging, I'm like, I want to do something that I know works and something I know I could be funny doing. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2015.82s)]
*  And something like working with Steve Martin, that somebody that you admire and think is funny, that's not challenging. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2024.82s)]
*  That's exciting to get to work with Steve Martin. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2032.82s)]
*  Anytime I'm working with somebody that I really, really like, it's not challenging. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2036.82s)]
*  Why are you more interested in the thing that you know is going to work? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2041.82s)]
*  Because first and foremost, I'm trying to be funny for my audience. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2044.82s)]
*  So you want to do stuff that you know is going to be funny for them. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2048.8199999999997s)]
*  I still do all different types of things, even though I don't want to be challenged. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2052.8199999999997s)]
*  I still do all types of things. I've done all types of things. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2057.8199999999997s)]
*  You even thought that some of them was challenging. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2060.82s)]
*  I'm like, it wasn't challenging. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2063.82s)]
*  What's challenging is when you're in a movie and the movie ain't your shit. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2065.82s)]
*  That's challenging. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2069.82s)]
*  That's challenging when you're sitting in the screening room and you see the first print of Pluto Nash. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2073.82s)]
*  That's challenging. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2078.82s)]
*  I remember the first time we watched Pluto Nash, I had my son Miles with me. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2080.82s)]
*  My son Miles was probably about eight. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2084.82s)]
*  Just the director, my lawyer was sitting there and Miles was sitting there with me. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2088.82s)]
*  The whole movie goes, the movie's all soft and shit. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2093.82s)]
*  Then at the end, the very last music sting. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2097.82s)]
*  It all goes to silence and my little baby son says, corny. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2102.82s)]
*  Corny. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2109.82s)]
*  That was challenging. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2110.82s)]
*  Your little baby, even the baby knows it's corny. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2113.82s)]
*  We were just watching, the other day we were just watching the new Beverly Hills Cop movie. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2116.82s)]
*  We were all watching it. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2121.82s)]
*  One of my kids, while he was watching it, he knows for the first time he's on his phone looking at shit. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2122.82s)]
*  He ain't barely paying it no mind. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2128.82s)]
*  You have to ask him if he liked the movie. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2130.82s)]
*  I was like, he ain't even watching this shit. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2133.82s)]
*  He was doing some kind of math equation too. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2135.82s)]
*  He stopped watching the movie. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2138.82s)]
*  He was like, six times, 27. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2139.82s)]
*  I was like, wow, he's doing math, doing the movie. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2142.82s)]
*  I actually told my son, don't do math right now. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2145.82s)]
*  Watch the movie. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2148.82s)]
*  I just saw Axel F a couple days ago. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2151.82s)]
*  It's coming out 40 years after the first Beverly Hills Cop movie. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2155.82s)]
*  What made you want to go back to that franchise now? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2159.82s)]
*  We've been trying to develop another Beverly Hills Cop since 96. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2163.82s)]
*  The one we did in 94, I didn't think the movie came out good. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2169.82s)]
*  There's been 10 different scripts and a bunch of different producers. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2174.82s)]
*  We tried for years and years and it just wouldn't come together. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2178.82s)]
*  Until we got Jerry back involved, the original producer. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2182.82s)]
*  Jerry Bruckheimer. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2185.82s)]
*  Jerry Bruckheimer, yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2186.82s)]
*  Jerry, he understood it the most because it's his movie. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2187.82s)]
*  It all came together. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2192.82s)]
*  Why was it so hard to figure out what the next Axel Foley movie should be? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2195.82s)]
*  If you look at the third Beverly Hills Cop, it just didn't have the emotional hook that the other ones have. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2200.82s)]
*  Axel has to be fueled by having one of his friends or somebody close to him is in danger or died or something. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2208.82s)]
*  That's what's fueling the first two movies. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2215.82s)]
*  The movie needs a great villain. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2218.82s)]
*  That's what Jerry brought all the elements back to. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2220.82s)]
*  It was his recipe. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2224.82s)]
*  Because Beverly Hills Cop, this whole action comedy genre kind of starts with Beverly Hills Cop. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2226.82s)]
*  Before Beverly Hills Cop, cops were really serious. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2233.82s)]
*  Dirty hat, go ahead and make my day. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2237.82s)]
*  It was no comedy with the cops. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2240.82s)]
*  Beverly Hills Cop kind of pioneered that. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2243.82s)]
*  Then all those movies that came out afterwards, Lethal Weapon and Die Hard and all those movies, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2246.82s)]
*  all the cops then are being funny and having one-liners and Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, and all that stuff. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2252.82s)]
*  That kind of starts after Beverly Hills Cop. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2259.82s)]
*  But what you were saying about how it just took so long for the right elements to come together for the new film [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2263.82s)]
*  and also how Beverly Hills Cop 3 didn't really work, it was reminding me. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2270.82s)]
*  I was just reading this book that Steve Martin did. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2274.82s)]
*  He said he basically doesn't want to make movies anymore. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2276.82s)]
*  He made 40 movies and he had to make 40 movies to get five good ones. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2279.82s)]
*  He kind of just didn't, sort of lost his juice for it. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2285.82s)]
*  Does that sort of resonate for you? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2289.82s)]
*  It actually is really hard to make things more good. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2291.82s)]
*  Yeah, but I have more than five good ones. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2295.82s)]
*  I feel like I have maybe five or six bad ones. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2299.82s)]
*  You know, Pluto Nash and... [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2303.82s)]
*  Pluto Nash might be the only shitty movie. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2307.82s)]
*  I have a couple of movies that are soft. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2309.82s)]
*  Movies that's like, okay, this movie is just okay, but it's not something that you're going to go see over and over again. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2311.82s)]
*  It's just... [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2316.82s)]
*  But no flops. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2318.82s)]
*  I used to call movies flop. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2319.82s)]
*  Oh, this movie's a flop and that movie's a flop. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2320.82s)]
*  I'm like, there's no such thing as flop. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2322.82s)]
*  I remember, because I've been in this business long enough to know that when I got in this business, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2325.82s)]
*  there was no Black Hollywood and there was just a handful of Black people that were working in films. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2330.82s)]
*  And just to get in a movie is an accomplishment. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2336.82s)]
*  And you feel like you still have the... [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2342.82s)]
*  Like the joy has never diminished or the pleasure in the actual process of making the stuff? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2345.82s)]
*  I never had joy. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2349.82s)]
*  There never was joy in the process of making a movie. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2350.82s)]
*  The process of making a movie is it's work. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2353.82s)]
*  You have to get up early in the morning and then the actual being in the scene, that's like a small part of the day. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2356.82s)]
*  I love that when we're on the set and we're trying to make it work and it's coming, you feel it clicking. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2363.82s)]
*  I love that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2367.82s)]
*  But hurry up and wait. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2368.82s)]
*  That's the movie business and it is not fun. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2370.82s)]
*  There's joy when the movie is finished and the movie worked. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2374.82s)]
*  Then there's joy. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2377.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2379.82s)]
*  As far as the process goes. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2380.82s)]
*  And I never lose sight of the fact that there's no flops because this is a blessing. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2381.82s)]
*  Just to be able to do this for a living is a blessing. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2387.82s)]
*  You referred to the term providence earlier in the conversation. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2393.82s)]
*  And also when we were talking about sort of avoiding the bombs, you said somebody's looking out for me. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2399.82s)]
*  Do you ever wonder why you? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2404.82s)]
*  I asked that question to Richard Pryor when I first met him in the car. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2408.82s)]
*  And he said, you can't think like that, Eddie. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2414.82s)]
*  He said, look at that bum over there. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2416.82s)]
*  There was a bum walking down the street. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2418.82s)]
*  He said, he's wondering why him? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2419.82s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you can't think like that. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2421.82s)]
*  Just being here, the chances of being born, one in 400 trillion. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2425.82s)]
*  Then when you add nuance to it, meet somebody and where you wind up working and what you wind up doing, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2431.82s)]
*  and whether you win the lottery, all the stuff that you add to it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2437.82s)]
*  You know, what my life has become and the life that I've had on paper wouldn't even happen. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2442.82s)]
*  So I can't question it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2448.82s)]
*  I have to go, this is all the way it's supposed to be. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2450.82s)]
*  After the break, I give Eddie a call back for some more stories about Hollywood and why his early days there weren't always easy. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2455.82s)]
*  I was the only one out there. I'm this young, rich, black one. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2465.82s)]
*  Everybody wasn't happy about that in 1983. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2469.82s)]
*  Even black folks. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2474.82s)]
*  Hi, Eddie. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2485.82s)]
*  Hey, what's up, man? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2493.82s)]
*  You sound mellow. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2495.82s)]
*  I'm a mellow guy. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2496.82s)]
*  All right, good. Good. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2498.82s)]
*  You know, I want to ask you this. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2502.82s)]
*  So, you know, I think I first got in touch with your publicist about trying to interview you four years ago during the pandemic. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2503.82s)]
*  And I think we got close and then it fell apart because we couldn't figure out how to do the photo. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2511.82s)]
*  And then this past February, I got in touch and he's like, you know, it might work out this time. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2514.82s)]
*  You know, when he finally wrote me back and said, OK, Eddie is up for this. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2518.82s)]
*  And then he put in quotation marks, which I assume meant it came from you, as long as there are no cheap shots. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2522.82s)]
*  And I was thinking, what kind of cheap shot would you be worried about? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2527.82s)]
*  Well, I wasn't worried about anything. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2532.82s)]
*  I say that before I do any interview. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2534.82s)]
*  No cheap shots. It's kind of tongue in cheek thing that I say. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2537.82s)]
*  Do you feel like you've taken a lot of cheap shots from the press over the years? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2541.82s)]
*  Oh, wow. Back in the old days, they used to be relentless on me. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2546.82s)]
*  And a lot of it was racist stuff, you know, it was a whole different. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2550.82s)]
*  There was no Black Hollywood. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2555.82s)]
*  There was no rappers and there was hip hop. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2557.82s)]
*  It was the 80s. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2560.82s)]
*  And it was, you know, just a whole different world. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2561.82s)]
*  Can you remember any examples? In what way was it racist? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2566.82s)]
*  Just think about it. It was the you know, Ronald Reagan was the president and it was that America. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2569.82s)]
*  You would do interviews and be like, I didn't say that. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2575.82s)]
*  I don't talk that way. They would be writing it in this weird ghetto. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2579.82s)]
*  I don't know what it is. I would have really weird shit that would go on. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2586.82s)]
*  Then I got really popular and then there was this negative backlash that comes with it. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2591.82s)]
*  It's like I was the only one out there. I'm this young, rich, Black one. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2596.82s)]
*  Everybody wasn't happy about that in 1983. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2601.82s)]
*  Even Black folks, you get cheap shots from your people. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2608.82s)]
*  Did it hurt? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2612.82s)]
*  You know, I remember when Nutty Professor came out. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2614.82s)]
*  This shows you how that is not even that long ago. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2617.82s)]
*  I got a cheap shot from my people. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2619.82s)]
*  And for the most part, everybody, you know, loves Nutty Professor. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2622.82s)]
*  But when it came out, I remember Ebony magazine, instead of talking about the movie, my performance and all that thing, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2626.82s)]
*  they said, maybe there'll come a day when a Black man can play a professor and he doesn't have to be Nutty. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2634.82s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2643.82s)]
*  That's the review of my movie. That's the review of that. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2645.82s)]
*  I play all these different characters and that's what you say about me. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2648.82s)]
*  And it's us and it's me. Yeah, that hurt my feelings. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2652.82s)]
*  That hurt my feelings. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2654.82s)]
*  Like, you know, when David Spade said that shit about my career on SNL, it was like, yo, it's in-house. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2655.82s)]
*  I'm one of the family and you fuck with me like that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2662.82s)]
*  It hurt my feelings like that. Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2665.82s)]
*  Yeah. I'm trying to remember. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2667.82s)]
*  He made some comment like about your, a couple of movies of yours flopped or something like that. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2669.82s)]
*  No, no, one movie. No, no, no, no, no. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2674.82s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2677.82s)]
*  Vampire Brooklyn came out and it was, and had it flopped. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2678.82s)]
*  He showed a picture of me up on the news and he said, hey, everybody, catch a falling star. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2681.82s)]
*  And it was like, wait, hold on, hold on. This is Saturday Night Live. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2687.82s)]
*  I'm the biggest thing that ever came off that show. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2692.82s)]
*  The show would have been off the air if I didn't go back on the show. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2695.82s)]
*  And now you got somebody from the cast making a crack about my career. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2698.82s)]
*  And I know that he can't just say that a joke has to go through these channels. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2703.82s)]
*  So the producers thought it was okay to say that. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2707.82s)]
*  And you've never, all the people that have been on that show, you never heard nobody make no joke about anybody's career. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2710.82s)]
*  And most people that get off that show, they don't go on to have these amazing careers. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2716.82s)]
*  So I took it, it was personal. It was like, yo, how could you do that? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2721.82s)]
*  What? My career? Really? A joke about my career? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2726.82s)]
*  So yeah, I thought that was, you know, that was a cheap shot. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2730.82s)]
*  And it was kind of racist. I thought I felt it was racist. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2733.82s)]
*  And then you stayed away from the show for a long time after that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2737.82s)]
*  30 years or some shit. In the long run, it's all good. Worked out great. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2741.82s)]
*  I'm cool with David Spade, cool with Lorne Michaels. I went back to SNL. I'm cool with everybody. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2747.82s)]
*  It's all love. But I had a couple of cheap shots. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2754.82s)]
*  You know, one thing I wanted to ask you, when we were discussing sort of how you think about your relationship with your audience, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2761.82s)]
*  and you said that, you know, you kind of just approach it from the perspective of, you know, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2768.82s)]
*  you're going to make what you think is good and what you think is funny, and hopefully the audience likes it. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2772.82s)]
*  And you also said that, you know, you don't really think about work in terms of seeking out challenges. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2778.82s)]
*  Like you're looking to do the projects that you're confident will succeed. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2784.82s)]
*  And I'm wondering if you can help me understand that a little bit more. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2789.82s)]
*  Did I say succeed? Did I say succeed or work? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2793.82s)]
*  Well, I think the word you used was stuff that will work. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2796.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2799.82s)]
*  Yeah. But don't you have to think about the audience's needs in order to have a sense if something is going to work or not? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2800.82s)]
*  How could you think about the audience's needs? Eight billion people on the planet and no two people having the same experience. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2808.82s)]
*  And they don't know. The audience doesn't. That's a better way of putting it. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2815.82s)]
*  The audience has no clue what's funny. You got to show them what's funny. They don't know. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2819.82s)]
*  And if something is funny to me, I've never, ever, ever had anything that made me laugh. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2825.82s)]
*  That when I said it to an audience, the audience just sat there and looked at me. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2831.82s)]
*  If I think it's funny, if I get that little feeling, like that silly little feeling like this is funny, it's always funny. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2835.82s)]
*  So why can't you get soul, soul, soul made then? You obviously think it's funny. Probably other people will think it's funny. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2843.82s)]
*  I've almost made soul, soul, soul a bunch of times. But I'll get right up to it and then I'll be like, this is too self-indulgent. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2849.82s)]
*  Nobody's going to go see this. I put a whole lot of work into it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2857.82s)]
*  And then people will be laughing real hard. I have some other movie to come up and I will go do it. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2861.82s)]
*  That's the way it's been going for 30 years almost. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2868.82s)]
*  I just recently had that experience with Donald Glover. I showed him that little clip, the soul, soul, soul thing. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2873.82s)]
*  And he was like, yo, you got to make this movie. How do we make this movie? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2882.82s)]
*  I was like, hey, yeah, you could figure out a way. And I don't know. But he was like, he wanted to do it. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2885.82s)]
*  How many people have seen that trailer? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2892.82s)]
*  Not a lot of people. It's like an inside thing. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2895.82s)]
*  I'm privileged. I think it's very telling though. Like surely you of all comedians and comic entertainers have earned the right to make a self-indulgent project. Why not just do it? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2898.82s)]
*  Because it's so much work. That's what's been the deterrent. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2911.82s)]
*  It's like, wow, you got to come up with all of this stuff and shoot all of this stuff, do all of this. A lot of work. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2918.82s)]
*  It's like doing a Nutty Professor movie. You got to go get all these famous people. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2924.82s)]
*  A lot of the people that I wanted to get in there passed away over these. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2929.82s)]
*  You want to get anybody that's alive that was a soul artist. You got to get them in it. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2933.82s)]
*  You got any old rockers, you got to get all of them in it to make it seem like this. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2938.82s)]
*  Murray is a real guy. Just a lot, a lot of work. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2942.82s)]
*  But I tell you one day I'll do it. I'm going to do it one day. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2947.82s)]
*  You also described an ideal day for you. And you said that an ideal day is a day where you basically do nothing. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2954.82s)]
*  You said you don't really read newspapers, you kind of just like to hang out at home, play music and stuff. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2962.82s)]
*  But you're obviously an intellectually curious guy. You're a sensitive artist who observes and feels things deeply. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2970.82s)]
*  So what is interesting to you in the wider world? I don't know, science, climate change, politics. Are you interested in any of that stuff? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2981.82s)]
*  No, no, no. I'll turn on CNN. I have like a week where I'll get up on everything and I'll turn it off and watch. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=2989.82s)]
*  You get totally detached from it. If you watch that shit every day, you go fucking crazy. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3001.82s)]
*  You go crazy and you can't be in the moment. You can't be in the moment. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3009.82s)]
*  I'm not going to be in the present moment. I'm off in that shit. I'm off in the computer. I'm off doing it. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3014.82s)]
*  I'm reading about all the other shit. I'm trying to be right here all the time. This moment. This is the only moment that's real. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3021.82s)]
*  Do you spend any time on the Internet other than reading news now and then? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3030.82s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know. I [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3034.82s)]
*  Choke Leg Bates is uh, you ever heard the expression taking your lemons and turning them into lemonade? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3064.82s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Peg leg Bates is the personification of that. Peg leg bates is a one leg tap dancer from the 40s I think. And you just Google peg leg after you finish. He was on the Ed Sullivan's show a lot. But he's amazing. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3072.1200000000003s)]
*  This is gonna date the interview a little [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3094.76s)]
*  It'll be old news by the time this runs, but Trump was just found guilty in the hush money case. No [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3097.36s)]
*  Guilty [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3105.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Wow. I did not see that. I did not think that was gonna happen [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3107.5600000000004s)]

*  There's an old [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3147.16s)]
*  Interview that you did with Spike Lee in spin magazine [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3148.6s)]
*  I want to say from like early 90s late 80s something like that and in there you say that you believed the government [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3151.3799999999997s)]
*  Bugged your house at one point. Why did you believe that? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3158.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, we found a little microphone in my house in my bedroom [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3163.8799999999997s)]
*  Did I say the government I am somebody put up somebody put a microphone in there? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3168.7999999999997s)]
*  Why would they have done that? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3174.08s)]
*  Who even knows in the 80s all they heard in my room was serious fucking going [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3176.44s)]
*  Boy, you know, it's hard to segue from that one [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3196.4s)]
*  If they had a bug in my room in the 80s they had no shit they could play over [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3198.8s)]
*  Let me go let me go here [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3211.52s)]
*  You know, I heard a [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3215.44s)]
*  Kevin Hart tell a story on Howard Stern show. He talked about a dinner that I think [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3217.52s)]
*  Maybe Dave Chappelle organized was [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3223.32s)]
*  Kevin Hart you Chris Rock Chris Tucker Dave Chappelle and in Kevin Hart's recollection of it. It's kind of this lovely [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3225.88s)]
*  moment where [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3234.92s)]
*  You know, you're all sharing stories and I guess trading jokes [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3236.04s)]
*  But really it was kind of about sort of showing their respect for you. Do you do you remember that dinner? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3239.32s)]
*  Yeah, I remember but I don't remember being the focal point of [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3245.76s)]
*  Table [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3251.88s)]
*  Well, but he he really put it in terms of [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3253.4s)]
*  you [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3256.6s)]
*  Laid down the path for those other guys, you know, and maybe it didn't feel like that's how [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3257.76s)]
*  you know that was kind of the vibe in the moment, but [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you understand what you mean to? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3266.92s)]
*  Comedians like Kevin Hart and Chappelle and Chris Rock and Chris Tucker. Well, I didn't lay down [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3270.56s)]
*  I didn't lay down a path. They took their own path. What happened with me was that the comic used to be [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3275.6s)]
*  You know the sidekick and the opening act and I changed it to where you know, the comic can be the main attraction [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3282.6400000000003s)]
*  They thought of comics one way and it was like no [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3290.28s)]
*  Comic could be this and the comic could sell out the arena and the comic could be in 100 million dollar movies [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3293.2400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't have to be you know, black exploitation movie [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3299.0400000000004s)]
*  It could be a movie that's accessible to everyone and all around the world people to go see it [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3302.1600000000003s)]
*  black star [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3307.88s)]
*  And you know it it one of the other things that that's stuck with me from our first conversation was you know, you you described [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3309.88s)]
*  just the the plain fact of getting to do what you do for a living as a blessing and [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3319.0s)]
*  I was thinking about that sort of in the context of [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3324.32s)]
*  You know also how you said you knew you were gonna be famous you knew you didn't think it you knew it and then also [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3330.1600000000003s)]
*  You got so [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3336.44s)]
*  Successful and so famous so quickly [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3339.4s)]
*  That I think you had said, you know, you took the success a little bit for granted [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3343.0s)]
*  I'm curious. When did you stop taking success for granted and start seeing [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3347.2000000000003s)]
*  Your career in your life as a blessing [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3352.56s)]
*  Wow, I think I knew it was a blessing from the beginning [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3357.2400000000002s)]
*  I took you know, how fast everything was moving for granted like oh, yeah, I guess it happened for everybody [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3361.08s)]
*  Happens like this and yeah, and I did say I was gonna be so this is what happens when you get famous [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3368.6s)]
*  So I took all of that for granted, but I was never like, oh, yeah, you know [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3373.28s)]
*  I'm the shit. This is this just happened to me. I always felt like it was a blessing [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3378.92s)]
*  There's no higher blessing you make people laugh. That's [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3383.52s)]
*  That's more than anything. It's more than making them dance and then without making them feel drama or whatever you can make people laugh [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3387.16s)]
*  That's the best shit ever and to know we look around and see that all the good things that came in my life that came [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3394.08s)]
*  To me all came from making somebody laugh [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuaJwOS8k&t=3401.12s)]
