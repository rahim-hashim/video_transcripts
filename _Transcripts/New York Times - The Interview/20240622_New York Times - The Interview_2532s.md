# 'The Interview': Gretchen Whitmer Wants a Gen X President — in 2028
**New York Times - The Interview:** [June 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA)
*  From the New York Times, this is the Interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=0.0s)]
*  There is one thing that's certain about this year's election. Whatever the result, it will [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=10.08s)]
*  be the end of an era, opening the door to a new generation of political leaders. And for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=14.8s)]
*  Democrats, there are few politicians busier than Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=21.12s)]
*  After serving in the Michigan State Legislature, Whitmer was elected to the governorship in 2018. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=27.88s)]
*  And when COVID hit, she became a national lightning rod for some of the restrictions [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=33.48s)]
*  she put in place, taking hits from Trump, whose rhetoric she blames for inspiring an [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=37.48s)]
*  assassination attempt against her. But it was what Whitmer achieved in 2022 that really [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=42.76s)]
*  cemented her as a political force. That year, she was reelected on the back of a reproductive [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  rights ballot referendum. She also achieved something that hadn't happened in nearly 40 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=53.56s)]
*  years in Michigan. With the help of redistricting, she gave Democrats a trifecta, with both the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  state house and the Senate flipping to blue. In the past few years, Whitmer has leveraged [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=64.68s)]
*  that majority to enact a progressive wish list of policies, including basic but meaningful [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=70.16s)]
*  gun control legislation, a new clean energy plan, and she's also been pushing for educational [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=75.56s)]
*  reforms like universal pre-K and free community college. Whitmer is term limited, though. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=81.24s)]
*  Her governorship will end in 2026. And there's a lot of speculation about what's next for her. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=87.24s)]
*  Like many politicians with national ambitions, she's written a new book about her life and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=93.56s)]
*  vision for the country. It's called True Grudge. She's also raising her profile as co-chair of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  President Biden's reelection campaign. We talk about Biden's challenges in the second half of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=103.96s)]
*  our conversation and about whether she can deliver the must-win state of Michigan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=109.0s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Governor Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=114.12s)]
*  I want to get the elephant out of the room, which is you're releasing this memoir in the middle of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=124.92s)]
*  the 2024 election cycle. So why now? So it's less of a memoir and more of like a handbook. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=130.52s)]
*  The question I get whenever I'm traveling, even within Michigan, but certainly outside of Michigan [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=137.8s)]
*  as well, is how do I stay positive in all the ugliness and craziness that I've had to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=143.08s)]
*  lead the state of Michigan through? How do I stay positive? Why do I want to keep doing this work? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=149.72s)]
*  And I thought, you know, this is going to be another heavy year. 2024? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=155.08s)]
*  Sure is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  It's going to feel very dark at times with the political rhetoric and this important election [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  coming up. And I thought, if I can put some light out into the world right now, maybe you can laugh [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=164.36s)]
*  at my expense. Or maybe there's a little inspiration here that'll help you get through whatever you were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=169.24s)]
*  navigating. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  Were you worried about how it was going to be perceived, though, putting it there at this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=176.28s)]
*  moment? Because you can put light into the dark at any time. But this is, as you mentioned, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=180.28s)]
*  just a very important election and you are a very prominent Democrat. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=184.44000000000003s)]
*  You know what? I can't worry about how everything's going to be perceived. That's one lesson I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  certainly have learned in the last six years. No matter what I do or say, people are going to have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=192.2s)]
*  their own take on it. So you got to do what you know the right thing to do is. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  This book did help me understand you as a person. It is a book that talks a lot about your own [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  personal story, how you view the world. You write in the book about how you partied in high school [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=208.2s)]
*  and college and that you didn't really become ambitious until you got into law school. You [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=214.92s)]
*  talk about how you actually threw up on your principal who found you passed out in the parking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=221.32s)]
*  lot from drinking. And first of all, like mortifying. But you didn't include this in your [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  book for no reason. So I'm curious, what were you hoping to show? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, every one of us has our flaws, right? That was a period of time when I was not particularly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=236.68s)]
*  disciplined and was focused more on having fun and that's okay, too. I learned a lot during that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=244.84s)]
*  period of time. But it was that real big screw up that taught me each phase in life. You learn [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=250.76s)]
*  things, you've got opportunities. And my mom and I, we had a very tough relationship during [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=259.0s)]
*  that period of time, as I would have had with my daughters if they'd been as wild as I was at that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=264.36s)]
*  age. But I also was the moment where I really learned who I was. And when I went to law school, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=269.48s)]
*  it's when it all started to click for me. So I was a little bit more of a late bloomer than my [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  sister was. But by the same token, I think these are lessons that help keep me humble. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=279.64s)]
*  And fortunately, when I was a teenager, we didn't all have phones where we could film one another, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=285.8s)]
*  making, you know, not the greatest judgments. Yeah, for sure. And in fact, you make a point [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=290.44s)]
*  that humor and being able to not take yourself so seriously is part of what you think makes you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=298.44s)]
*  a powerful politician in a way. You actually put a picture of yourself in the book missing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=306.92s)]
*  a front tooth because you had an accident growing up. So first of all, it's funny that you married [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=311.88s)]
*  a dentist. Right. As a woman, though, we're always so attuned to the way we look, how we're perceived. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=317.8s)]
*  I mean, women we know and specifically in politics get judged a lot more harshly. Do you worry about [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=327.32s)]
*  that? I do, you know, especially at the beginning of my career as a young woman in going into [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=333.24s)]
*  politics. Women, of course, you know, we can't just switch out ties every day. We've got to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=339.56s)]
*  be mindful of what we wear on top of how we look, etc. And so I get expensive. Most of the things [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=347.0s)]
*  that I wear and buy are actually secondhand. And I rented a dress from Rent the Runway to give my [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=354.12s)]
*  first state of the state speech and the predominantly Republican legislature to whom I was addressing at [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=361.64s)]
*  the time. I knew that there were a lot of things that they weren't going to share as terms of values [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  and vision for the state. And when I laid out the vision, but I wanted to feel confident going in, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=373.64s)]
*  I wore this I thought attractive blue dress. Oh my God, the fashion police showed up the next day. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=378.2s)]
*  The critique was not about what I said or the important message that I shared. It was about [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=384.76s)]
*  what I was wearing. And they actually interviewed people about how they thought I looked in that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=390.52s)]
*  dress. And, you know, as the mother of two young women, it was just crushing, not because it hurt [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=395.0s)]
*  my feelings, but because here I am laying out a vision for a state after just getting elected [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=401.56s)]
*  the chief executive officer of a state of 10 million people, or we have serious issues to tackle. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=406.68s)]
*  And that's what I was talking about. And the focus was what I was on what I was wearing. And I think [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=412.76s)]
*  that we deal with a lot more of that than men ever do. And I am mindful of it because I want [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=417.16s)]
*  people to focus on what I'm saying, not anything else. When you say you're mindful of it, do you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=422.44s)]
*  forefront your gender or do you pretend that it's not there? I'm not going to talk about it. I'm a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  person in a suit and my gender doesn't matter. Or do you feel that there is a different thing that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=433.24s)]
*  as a female politician you bring to the table? I go back and forth, to be honest, Lulu. I think [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  that there are moments where you might take a situation as a learning opportunity to educate [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=444.68s)]
*  someone. There are moments where when you're talking about something that is inherently [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=452.92s)]
*  gender-based, reproductive rights, for instance, talk about my experience as a woman, as a sexual [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=458.12s)]
*  assault survivor. There are moments where I ignore the noise and just muster through. It's, I think, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  a calculation. A calculation maybe sounds too, you know, planning. It's an assessment that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=473.24s)]
*  women have to make at all times. A colleague when I was in the Senate came up to me and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  said something totally out of bounds and very over the line. And I remember sitting there thinking, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=485.8s)]
*  I've got to figure out how to respond to this. Can I educate him? Why what he just said is totally [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=492.44s)]
*  inappropriate. Do I ignore it? Do I laugh and brush it off and tell him that he's foolish? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=496.68s)]
*  Do I take it on in a very serious way? And it's sometimes exhausting to figure out how do I have [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=503.24s)]
*  to respond to someone else's bad behavior. But I'm mindful because I think about the women who come [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=509.16s)]
*  after me or my own daughters. And what did you decide? Well, in that one, I responded with some [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=515.8s)]
*  very colorful language and put him in his place and he never bothered me again. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=521.88s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about you as a political leader because one of the reasons [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=527.8s)]
*  you are viewed as this rising star for Democrats is that you are a popular governor in a battleground [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=535.48s)]
*  state. In 2022, you got a trifecta for the Democrats. You won the House, you won the Senate, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=541.96s)]
*  and you won the governorship. I guess my question is there's two ways that you can move when [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=547.0s)]
*  something like that happens, especially in a state that is so closely divided. You can decide to do [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=555.56s)]
*  what some governors in red states and purple states have done, which is to say, I'm going to be [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=562.76s)]
*  a centrist, I'm going to move more incrementally, or you can enact what is a very partisan agenda, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=569.0s)]
*  right? You took that second route. What was the calculation there? Why did you decide [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=577.4s)]
*  I'm going to really try and run with the ball? Well, we ran on an agenda and people elected [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=582.2s)]
*  us on that agenda. And so my philosophy is if people have elected you to do something, do it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=587.0s)]
*  Don't waste time. Don't make excuses. Deliver. And I'm grateful that I've got this second term. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=593.8s)]
*  A lot of folks are writing my political obituary going into the re-elect in 2022. I ended up [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  winning by almost 11 points. And that, for me, made me feel very confident that people expected me to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=607.16s)]
*  lead on the issues on which I was running. I also, though, want to make sure to recognize, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=614.12s)]
*  I think you can't win an election in Michigan by double digits if you're not also drawing over [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=619.56s)]
*  people who are not traditional Democrats. And I'm proud of that. One of the stories in the book I [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=625.4799999999999s)]
*  tell is about my friend Randy Richardville, the Republican leader. And we had a lot of knockdown [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=631.64s)]
*  dragouts. When I was the Democratic leader in the Senate, he was the Republican leader, he was in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=637.24s)]
*  the majority. We did battle. We'd often, though, also end the day going and grabbing a beer together. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  Because I think that it's important to not take things personally, but to stay focused on doing [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=648.36s)]
*  the job and also trying to continue to build relationships with diverse sets of interests [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=654.28s)]
*  and people. That's what our system is supposed to be about. It's supposed to be about that. But, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=661.16s)]
*  one of the things that I know other Democrats have pointed to is that the Republican Party [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=665.8s)]
*  under Donald Trump has gone in a particular direction that makes that they feel very, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=671.16s)]
*  very difficult. So, that sounds great to sit and have a beer with your political adversary, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=676.36s)]
*  but at the same time, there are huge ideological chasms at the moment. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=682.36s)]
*  There's no question. I mean, it's challenging. I don't ever want to imply that it's easy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=687.48s)]
*  It takes work. It takes thick skin and a short memory. And that's a good thing in politics, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=692.28s)]
*  that's for sure. During the pandemic, when things were really at their hottest, when [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=697.9599999999999s)]
*  the former president singled me out and called me that woman from Michigan, and I was getting a lot [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=704.28s)]
*  of threats at the time, my Republican-led legislature, who'd worked with me pretty well [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=709.4s)]
*  up until that moment, really turned on me. That was the moment when everything kind of changed. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=714.76s)]
*  I share a picture in the book from the window that I took on my phone when they had a demonstration. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=720.04s)]
*  People showed up in their cars and shut down the capital city. And they were holding up signs, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=726.52s)]
*  calling me a Nazi. We saw Confederate flags, saw a Barbie that was dressed like me and hanging [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=732.6s)]
*  from a noose. And it was shocking. I also had a Republican leader who took to calling me names [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=741.16s)]
*  and shared a stage with some of the folks that ultimately were tried for the plot to kidnap and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  kill me. And yet, I had to keep negotiating with that guy because I had to get a budget done. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=755.24s)]
*  And so, I think that that short memory and thick skin is really important if we're going to try to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=760.84s)]
*  bridge these gaps, because I got a job to do at the end of the day. Let's talk about that era, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=769.0s)]
*  because it was the period when you became a national figure. Very early on, you and then [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=774.36s)]
*  President Trump were at odds, to put it mildly. And you became a symbol of what Republicans saw [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=780.52s)]
*  as draconian pandemic restrictions. You faced protests, death threats. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=788.04s)]
*  You write that you were shocked at how virulent the reaction was. Looking back, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=795.64s)]
*  why do you think people reacted the way they did so quickly? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=801.88s)]
*  One of the things that I did during the pandemic was talk to my colleagues a lot, especially my [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=806.12s)]
*  Midwestern group of governors, bipartisan group, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=812.36s)]
*  Minnesota, and even Kentucky. And it was really helpful for perspective. Every one of us was [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=819.08s)]
*  dealing with some level of that animosity. In swing states, it was even more heightened because of the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=825.72s)]
*  political dynamic and I think some intentional efforts to really gin it up. But every one of us [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=832.92s)]
*  was dealing with it. When I chatted with Mike DeWine, who is in a Republican controlled [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=839.56s)]
*  state of Ohio, and he's dealing with threats or dealing with anger from his legislature, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=844.68s)]
*  trying to scale back his executive powers. That was really good for perspective for me. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  I will say, though, that it was uniquely worse in Michigan. One of my colleagues on our group call [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  said, you know, Gretchen, you're doing a lot of the same things the rest of us are, but why do you [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=862.4399999999999s)]
*  take so much more crap for it? And he said, as soon as that last word landed, he said, wait, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=866.76s)]
*  don't answer that question. I know you're the one woman that's doing it of this group of governors. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=872.2s)]
*  And I think it was sexism. Well, that was his theory. And I'm not going to combat that. I do [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=877.64s)]
*  think that that was maybe what made our situation in Michigan stand out. Things went off the rails [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=882.84s)]
*  in Michigan. In October 2020, 14 men ended up being arrested for plotting to kidnap you [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=890.2s)]
*  and overthrow the Michigan government. You write in the book that this was referred to in the press [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=896.76s)]
*  as a kidnapping plot, but you say that's not accurate. Can you tell me why not? What do you [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=901.4000000000001s)]
*  see it as? I'll tell you in context of another situation that was covered as a assassination [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=908.9200000000001s)]
*  attempt. Not long ago, there was a single person that showed up on Justice Kavanaugh's lawn, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=915.96s)]
*  and it's been covered as an assassination attempt. It was one person. He was apprehended well before [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=924.12s)]
*  any threat really became real to Justice Kavanaugh. And I'm grateful for that. I recognize a threat [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  against anyone, no matter who they are, what their political views is, undermines our system of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=937.64s)]
*  democracy. And I think that's really important that we all call it out when it happens. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=942.36s)]
*  The way that was covered versus how 12 to 14 people who were plotting over the series of months [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=946.6800000000001s)]
*  who were doing exercises, they had what they called a kill house, running through scenarios about how [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=955.48s)]
*  to kidnap me and kill me. And let's be clear, they weren't going to keep me for ransom. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=962.2s)]
*  Their intention was to, like a terrorist organization, have a sham trial and then [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=968.76s)]
*  execute me. It was very clear in a lot of their communications that was the plan, and it was over [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=974.68s)]
*  the series of months they staked out vacation property that my husband and I have on more than [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=979.88s)]
*  one occasion. They had plots to blow up bridges and kill police officers as well, to even burn [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=985.88s)]
*  down the Capitol, locking the legislature inside. All of that has been labeled a kidnapping plot. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=991.8s)]
*  And it does feel like it is to discount the seriousness. It was over such a longer period [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=999.16s)]
*  of time, so many more people involved, so many weapons involved. And yet the discrepancy of how [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1005.4s)]
*  that was covered versus how this one person on Justice Kavanaugh's lawn was covered, it was really [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1010.36s)]
*  shocking when you think about it. You write in the book that you want to meet with one of the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  plotters who pleaded guilty who is in prison now. What do you want to know? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1023.0s)]
*  I'd like to understand what drove this group of people to take this extreme position and to try to [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1028.84s)]
*  undergo this exercise, to try to kidnap me and kill me. I want to understand it. What is happening? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1040.6s)]
*  You think there's something to understand? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1045.8s)]
*  Maybe. Maybe there's not. But I'd like to see. I'd like to know, is it because there wasn't, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1047.48s)]
*  for that person, economic opportunity? Was it because they got laid off during the pandemic [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1054.76s)]
*  and they were really worried about how they were going to make their house payment? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1060.2s)]
*  What was it that set them off? It can't just be the fact that we wanted people to wear a mask, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1064.44s)]
*  because they showed up in masks to be not identified. So it wasn't the act of wearing a [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  mask. But what was it? What was happening that is there a lesson to learn from this? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1075.4s)]
*  That's what I always want to know. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1080.92s)]
*  Do you forgive the plotters? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1082.28s)]
*  I do. And eight of them are doing hard time now. So I think that's important to point out. Some [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1085.9599999999998s)]
*  were acquitted. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1091.32s)]
*  And you write in the book that you think that that was unfair. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1092.36s)]
*  I do think that it was very sad to see such a disparate treatment of people that were a part [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1096.28s)]
*  of the same undertaking. And I think it does us all a disfavor if there's not accountability. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1103.08s)]
*  But for the ones who took accountability and who shared their remorse and participated with the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1109.72s)]
*  prosecution, I did ask the judge to take that into account and to recognize that that is a [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1116.04s)]
*  positive outcome. And hopefully that that was reflected in the sentencing. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1122.76s)]
*  Separate from what happened to you during this period of the pandemic, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1128.68s)]
*  I do want to ask you about some of the lessons that you may have learned. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  Michigan's stay at home order did last longer than other states. You closed all the schools in March [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1136.6s)]
*  2020. And you didn't urge them to be reopened until a year later. Do you think now that we sort of [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1142.36s)]
*  have the fullness of hindsight? Schools should have reopened earlier because we know now how [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1151.24s)]
*  profoundly it impacted kids to be out of the classroom? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1157.8799999999999s)]
*  I have said many times that if I could go back in time with the knowledge we've accumulated now, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1162.28s)]
*  there certainly are things that I would have done differently. I also want to remind everyone [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1168.28s)]
*  that during that period of time, Michigan was so hot compared to the rest of the country. It was [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1175.0s)]
*  New York, Detroit, it was Chicago, and it was New Orleans that were having massive impact from [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1182.36s)]
*  COVID. Our hospitals were at real brink. Of course, you were dealing with the situation, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1191.08s)]
*  and no one really knew how to deal with this. It's less about what you were facing, but more [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1196.52s)]
*  specifically about the impacts of schools. You're seeing it in Michigan, chronic absenteeism, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1202.1999999999998s)]
*  students performing below pre-pandemic levels in reading and math. Just applying that as [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1207.32s)]
*  the current governor, what do you see maybe the lessons are of that period, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1212.76s)]
*  particularly when it comes to kids in schools? We have to remember that we were looking at [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1216.52s)]
*  lessons from the Spanish flu and recognizing that we hadn't dealt with a global pandemic in [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1222.28s)]
*  100 years, that that particular virus absolutely was devastating to younger people. As a person [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1228.44s)]
*  taking in as much information as I could from our epidemiologists and our public health experts, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1237.64s)]
*  the thought that we might have a lot of school-age kids that were going to die from this [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1242.76s)]
*  virus I think was really what motivated our actions and the actions of lots of governors [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1247.3200000000002s)]
*  when we stopped kids going to school. It has carried a long, hard price tag with it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1253.72s)]
*  We've made massive investments in early childhood and in free breakfast and lunch for all 1.4 [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1261.32s)]
*  million Michigan kids and literacy coaches. We're working to help get our kids back on track. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1267.96s)]
*  But absolutely, if I could go back in time with the knowledge we have now and knowing this virus [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1273.72s)]
*  didn't disproportionately kill children, would I have done some things differently? Yes. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1279.0s)]
*  Staying in Michigan, one of the more recent issues, it's fair to say, that you struggled [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1285.8s)]
*  with is a conflict in Gaza. Michigan has the second largest population of Arab Americans in [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1290.92s)]
*  the country. There was a huge movement to vote uncommitted to protest the Biden administration's [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1296.84s)]
*  handling of the conflict. In some Arab American communities, up to three quarters of Democrats [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1303.88s)]
*  cast their votes as uncommitted. Do you worry that the protest vote will translate into meaningful [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1311.16s)]
*  erosion of Biden's support? I think one of the really important lessons right now is everyone's [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1316.68s)]
*  hurting. The only universal truth here in the states is that everyone's hurting. We're watching [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1324.68s)]
*  what's happening, the loss of life. It's profound. The hostages that are still in captivity, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1331.8s)]
*  the remains of hostages who've not survived. So I do think that it was important for people who [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1340.6s)]
*  disagree with the policy to be able to make an outward statement of that through that vote. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1347.72s)]
*  I also think it's important to recognize we've got a high stakes election coming up. We know that this [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1354.12s)]
*  is a very stark choice in front of us. There are going to be generational impacts from the outcome [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1361.32s)]
*  of this election. So I'm doing everything I can to make sure that Michiganders and all of these [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1368.76s)]
*  communities feel seen, heard, respected, and reflected in the policies of President Biden. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1375.1599999999999s)]
*  What does that look like? Recent polling has shown that among Muslim and Arab American voters, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1382.84s)]
*  Trump is leading Biden by 32 points. That's a huge defection from 2020. So how are you addressing [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1388.92s)]
*  that? What we have seen, at least in so many of the conversations that I've had on the ground in [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1395.8000000000002s)]
*  Michigan, is this is a community that takes umbrage with the, to put it lightly, with the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1401.0s)]
*  president's policies. That being said, I hear routinely that they also recognize that a vote [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1407.88s)]
*  for Donald Trump is a vote for someone who pushed a Muslim ban, who talks about countries with [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1415.0s)]
*  people of color in incredibly harsh and cruel terms. I think that making sure that people [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1422.36s)]
*  come out and vote is going to be the important focus of our work going into the fall election. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1429.08s)]
*  I don't take any vote for granted and I don't think that the Biden administration does either. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1436.04s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Last question about Gaza, which is a bit of a personal one. We've seen a lot of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1440.84s)]
*  college activism. You have two college-age daughters. One just graduated from Michigan [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1446.52s)]
*  and one is still a student there. What have they been telling you about what's going on in campus? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1452.76s)]
*  KATE BOWEN Well, I'm glad that I've got a 22-year-old and a 20-year-old who are very [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1458.84s)]
*  confident and invested and vocal and I learn as much from my kids as I do anybody and I'm grateful. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1465.16s)]
*  You know, my daughter, my oldest, called me early on, probably late last fall, and she was really [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1474.04s)]
*  upset about the deaths in Gaza and the escalating loss of innocent lives, jarred by what happened [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1481.0800000000002s)]
*  October 7th without question, and then the ongoing loss. I've asked her questions. She's got a [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1489.8s)]
*  wonderful diverse group of friends. This generation sees, I think, the humanitarian need and is very [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1496.92s)]
*  motivated to call on our leaders to address the crisis that is playing out every single day. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1506.2s)]
*  So I am very appreciative of their advocacy and activity and I think it's [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1514.1200000000001s)]
*  emblematic of what we're seeing across our younger generation. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1521.0800000000002s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So you think the protests on campuses [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1523.88s)]
*  were a legitimate expression of that? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1528.2800000000002s)]
*  KATE BOWEN Some of them were. Some of them crossed the line. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1529.72s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK You know, it's funny, as we've been talking, it strikes me that we've been talking [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1532.3600000000001s)]
*  about issues in Michigan, but they're all so resonant to the national stage, right? Your [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1537.88s)]
*  state is such a microcosm of what is happening in different parts of this country. And you know, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1543.16s)]
*  you are one of the co-chairs of the Biden re-election campaign. As we're speaking today, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1550.0400000000002s)]
*  you just came from the White House. And obviously, the president's age has been an issue for voters, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1556.7600000000002s)]
*  and there's been a lot of questions about his mental fitness. He's 81 years old. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1562.2s)]
*  Pretending that this isn't an issue hasn't really been working for Democrats. I mean, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1567.88s)]
*  it is an issue for voters. Do you see it as a legitimate concern? And how should [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1571.96s)]
*  Democrats be talking about it? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1577.96s)]
*  KATE BOWEN Well, one of the things I know is you can't tell people how to feel, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1579.4s)]
*  and you can't tell people to ignore something they are questioning or they're interested in. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1582.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's important to recognize, yes, the two leading standard bearers for the two big [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1587.24s)]
*  political parties in this country are both, you know, 80-ish, right? That's an inescapable fact. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1593.4s)]
*  One has got a record of delivering incredibly for the people of our country. The CHIPS Act, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1601.64s)]
*  the IRA, the investment that's happening on shoring supply chains, and the investment on [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1608.92s)]
*  bridges and roads all across this country. President Biden has a record of delivering, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1614.8400000000001s)]
*  and that's the kind of leadership, I think, that we will see for the next four years if he's [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1620.36s)]
*  re-elected. On the contrary, the other 80-ish year old is someone who has not articulated any [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  sort of vision for our country, someone who has been more about dividing us, someone who, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1633.0s)]
*  when they don't like someone, will attack them and mobilize their supporters to threaten them, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1638.6s)]
*  someone who has only talked about grievance and vengeance. And I think people want a leader who [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1644.44s)]
*  is going to make their lives better, who is going to work at it every single day. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1651.32s)]
*  President Biden has shown that he is that person, and he's the only person that falls into that [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1655.48s)]
*  category in this race for president. So I'm hearing the message there. It does make me think, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1660.6799999999998s)]
*  though, something you do write a lot about in the book is the power of messaging, the power of how [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1666.52s)]
*  you articulate a vision. It's something that you were very proud of in 2017 and 2018. Your slogan [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1671.32s)]
*  was, Fix the damn roads. I learned a lot about Michigan roads reading your book. I want to say [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1678.12s)]
*  that I didn't know. But my editor had to Google to find out what Biden's slogan this year was, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1683.32s)]
*  and it is, Finish the job, which I have to say is not much of a humdinger. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1690.84s)]
*  I'm curious if you have sharper ideas, because you seem to be good at this. And right now, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1695.08s)]
*  Democrats nationally are really struggling with messaging about where the party stands. When I [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1699.88s)]
*  talk to voters, they really have trouble articulating what Democrats are going to do for them. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1704.92s)]
*  I think that, I talk to a lot of my colleagues. Governors, I think, know what's going on in their [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1714.6000000000001s)]
*  states better than anybody. And we all get asked, what about the national messaging? And I think a [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1719.0800000000002s)]
*  national message is always a challenge. Washington, D.C. is so far away from the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1723.4s)]
*  average person's life that to conceptualize what a $3 trillion investment in onshore and supply [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1729.0s)]
*  chains means to your everyday life is darn near impossible to discern. And that's why [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1735.64s)]
*  I've always learned when you show up and ask people, they're going to tell you what they want. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1741.88s)]
*  They're going to tell you what they need, and they're going to use the language that they use. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1746.1200000000001s)]
*  Fix the damn roads was not something that we poll tested or focus group. It was just conversation [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1750.28s)]
*  after conversation. What do you need me to do if I'm elected? Fix the damn roads. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1756.68s)]
*  But Governor Whitmer, it's ironic because President Biden passed an infrastructure bill. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1760.92s)]
*  He is fixing the damn roads. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1764.92s)]
*  That's right. And bridges and internet. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1766.6s)]
*  Right. But he's not getting credit for it. I mean, why do you think that is? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1768.44s)]
*  For that same reason, right? I think the pandemic's taken a toll. People are stressed [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1772.28s)]
*  out. They're just trying to pay the grocery bill, get the kids off to school, show up at their job, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1777.0s)]
*  and maybe get a little bit of sleep at night. They're not consuming everything. They can't [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1782.76s)]
*  discern what the CHIPS Act has meant. And so we got to tell that story better. There's no question [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1787.08s)]
*  that that's maybe one of the most important, biggest challenges for us going into this election. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1793.0s)]
*  But in many ways, this is a kind of vibes election. I mean, when you poll people and you ask them, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1798.36s)]
*  what is the economy doing? They think it's in recession. How is the stock market doing? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1804.12s)]
*  They think it's down. There isn't a real understanding of even where the country is at. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1808.76s)]
*  So then how do you reach those people? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1813.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, and an interesting thing too is in some of the most recent research, individuals feel like [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1815.9599999999998s)]
*  their situation is pretty good, but the rest of the economy is not good. And that's the absolute [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1822.28s)]
*  inverse of what generally you see. People feel like, okay, I'm not doing good, but everyone [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1830.68s)]
*  else seems to be getting ahead. It's the inverse. It's a strange phenomenon. I don't know how to [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1835.24s)]
*  explain it, but I do know we've got to make sure that people appreciate all the different things [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1840.2s)]
*  that are happening in their communities because of the work that President Biden has done. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1845.8s)]
*  So last question. Biden is behind in many polls, and certainly it is close in swing states like [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1850.04s)]
*  yours. He is losing ground to young people, black and brown voters. As we record this, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1860.92s)]
*  the polls are pretty tight in Michigan. It's a must-win state. Do you feel pressure to deliver [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1867.16s)]
*  the state? Can you? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1874.04s)]
*  Well, in 2022, we absolutely ran up our numbers, one by 11 points, and flipped the legislature in [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1875.16s)]
*  the process. We showed up everywhere. That is going to be even more important now than ever. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1884.44s)]
*  I do always know that there's a path to victory through Michigan. It's going to be a little more [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1891.0800000000002s)]
*  challenging this cycle, but we've rolled up our sleeves. We're not going to get distracted. We [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1896.8400000000001s)]
*  don't celebrate small leads in polls. We don't fall apart when there's a small lead on the other [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1901.72s)]
*  side in a poll. It's Michigan. It's going to be tight all the way through the election. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1909.0s)]
*  We're going to do the work, and I feel confident we're going to be able to win this race. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1913.64s)]
*  Rich Whitmer, thank you so much. I look forward to our next conversation. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1919.16s)]
*  Me too. Thank you. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1922.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1923.24s)]
*  After the break, I call the governor back to get her take on a few specific issues, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1927.48s)]
*  including reproductive rights. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1932.44s)]
*  Every American woman and her family and health care providers deserve to know that this fundamental [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1935.0s)]
*  question around health care is vested solely in the individual, and that's going to have to happen [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1941.8000000000002s)]
*  at the federal level. So I do believe we've got to continue. And I do believe that's why this [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1947.0s)]
*  upcoming election is such high stakes. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1952.12s)]
*  Hi, Governor Whitmer. It's Lulu. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1973.7199999999998s)]
*  Hi. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  Where are you right now? Where am I catching you? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1976.6s)]
*  Right now, I am in Detroit. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1978.76s)]
*  The great city of Detroit. Governor, we only have a little bit of time, so I want to jump right in. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1980.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1988.2s)]
*  So I'm guessing that you're not going to tell me if you're running for president in 2028, right? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1989.4s)]
*  I don't know what the heck I'm going to do in 2028. So you can ask, but that's the honest answer. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=1995.72s)]
*  That's fair. But you're clearly preparing for a bigger role on the national stage. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2000.92s)]
*  You are term limited. Your term ends in 2026. So I do want to sort of understand how you think [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2006.28s)]
*  about some key issues. And after our last conversation, I was thinking about how we [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2012.76s)]
*  really didn't get to dig into reproductive rights. And I wanted to ask you on a national level, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2020.2s)]
*  Roe isn't coming back. Congress has been unable to pass legislation protecting contraception, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2027.56s)]
*  much less abortion. Do you see any way to protect abortion at the national level? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2034.2s)]
*  Well, I do. And I think ultimately that's got to be the goal. Right now, we've seen it all across [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2040.76s)]
*  the country. When people get an opportunity to weigh in, they overwhelmingly vote to enshrine [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2047.64s)]
*  abortion rights. We saw it in Ohio. We saw it in Wisconsin with their Supreme Court election. We [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2054.28s)]
*  saw it in Michigan, a 10 year quest to undo legislation that made it more difficult for [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2061.56s)]
*  women to access abortion and health care. I got to sign the repeal of that into law in the wake of [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2070.76s)]
*  us amending our constitution to protect abortion rights. And talk about that in the book, how [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2077.88s)]
*  personally gutted I was when I shared my story of being a sexual assault survivor. Didn't make a [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2082.2s)]
*  damn difference on the debate. But 10 years later as governor, we flipped the legislature, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2089.64s)]
*  we stayed at it. And ultimately I got to sign the repeal. These are overarching issues. We don't [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2095.96s)]
*  solve them overnight, but the fight is worth having. What I'm hearing you say is that the only way to [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2102.68s)]
*  really resolve this now is going state by state. And as you know, that's going to lead to basically [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2108.68s)]
*  a patchwork situation where some women will be able to have the right to reproductive freedom [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2115.96s)]
*  and some women won't because of where they live. Which is why, you know, at this point, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2122.76s)]
*  this is where we can make progress in this moment by enshrining it where we have those tools. But at [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2128.44s)]
*  the end of the day, every American woman and her family and health care providers deserve to know [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2134.92s)]
*  that this fundamental question around health care is vested solely in the individual. And that's [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2141.08s)]
*  going to have to happen at the federal level. So I do believe that's why this upcoming election [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2147.4s)]
*  has such high stakes, not just for abortion rights, but certainly abortion rights are at the heart of [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2152.2s)]
*  a lot of what we're talking about, individual freedoms. Speaking of that, you know, the Supreme [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2159.0s)]
*  Court has been mired in controversy, especially around Justices Alito and Thomas. Do you think [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2165.48s)]
*  they need to recuse themselves from rulings on anything to do with the 2020 election and President [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2171.08s)]
*  Trump? Well, you know, as a lawyer, my understanding is that, you know, that would be appropriate. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2175.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court operates under their own rules. I think it's really something that gives me great [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2183.72s)]
*  anxiety is this distrust in institutions that have sustained this democracy for so long. And [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2192.12s)]
*  we sadly have seen so many Americans get persuaded by, I think, false information and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2199.72s)]
*  undermine our institutions. And then when you see justices that appear to have real conflict, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2208.2799999999997s)]
*  not recuse themselves, it further erodes our confidence in these institutions that sustain [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2215.16s)]
*  this democracy. And it's very concerning. Yes. Do you think the court needs to be expanded then? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2220.36s)]
*  I mean, because it's a 6-3 majority. And if things like abortion rights, for example, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2226.28s)]
*  are ever going to be reconsidered, the current makeup of the court isn't one that is favorable [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2230.76s)]
*  to Democrats. You know, Lilloo, we're stepping way outside of, you know, my expertise as a legal [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2236.84s)]
*  mind. But I would just say this, whether or not the court gets expanded or whether or not, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2246.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, we just ensure that President Biden is the one in that office who makes [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2251.7999999999997s)]
*  the next handful of appointments. All of these things work toward the same end of [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2255.8799999999997s)]
*  restoring some integrity into our government, which is desperately needed. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2260.9199999999996s)]
*  Moving to another subject, it does seem that 2028 is going to necessarily see a changing of the [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2267.4799999999996s)]
*  Guard. What do you hope your generation of politicians can do for the country? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2273.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm 52, almost 53. And, you know, as I talk to my fellow Gen Xers. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2278.12s)]
*  Best generation. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2287.08s)]
*  Yeah. We recognize that, you know, our parents' generation has had a lot of excess. And certainly, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2288.6s)]
*  I worry about so many of the decisions that were made prior to my kids' generation and [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2296.2s)]
*  what they are worried about. And so I'm hopeful that we can really move the needle, whether it's [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2301.64s)]
*  around bringing down our nation's debt or ensuring that we are active when it comes to climate and [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2307.08s)]
*  solidifying and protecting individual rights. These are really the existential issues that [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2314.68s)]
*  my kids' generation is worried about, gun violence, et cetera. And so I'm hopeful that in 2028, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2320.84s)]
*  we see Gen Xers running for the White House and let someone from my generation is ready to take [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2328.12s)]
*  the mantle. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2334.7599999999998s)]
*  My last question is about Trump. You know, he is a convicted felon now. And even if he doesn't win [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2337.16s)]
*  the election, Trumpism as a political movement seems like it's here to stay. Do you agree with [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2345.24s)]
*  that? Do you think his ideas and his vision will outlast him? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2351.08s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not sure, to be honest, Lulu. I think that there are still a lot of Republicans [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2355.24s)]
*  out there who would not identify as Trump supporters but are not willing to relinquish [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2362.6s)]
*  their party. They're fighting to bring back some common sense and more traditional viewpoints [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2368.12s)]
*  and values to the party. And I'm hopeful that they're successful because I do think it's [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2375.56s)]
*  important for our system of governance to have robust debates with people of different perspectives. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2379.96s)]
*  I miss having pro-choice Republicans in Michigan in government. I miss being able to have thoughtful [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2386.36s)]
*  debates and then ultimately find common ground. I'm always striving for it, but it's a lot more [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2394.44s)]
*  challenging. And you know, I think the average person in this country expects that of us. And so [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2399.96s)]
*  I'm hopeful that this is a chapter, but not a trajectory. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2406.1200000000003s)]
*  Governor Whitmer, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lm8nAxR3xA&t=2411.16s)]
