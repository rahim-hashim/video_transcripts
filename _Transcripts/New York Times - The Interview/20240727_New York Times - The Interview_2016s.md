# Pete Buttigieg Thinks the Trump Fever Could Break
**New York Times - The Interview:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=6.32s)]
*  It has been, no exaggeration, one of the most consequential and dizzying periods in modern [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=10.76s)]
*  American politics. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=17.06s)]
*  It began with President Biden's disastrous debate, then came an assassination attempt [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=19.02s)]
*  against former President Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=23.18s)]
*  A week later, President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=24.66s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=29.06s)]
*  And now Harris is the de facto Democratic nominee. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=30.06s)]
*  At warp speed, the dynamics of this entire election have changed, not just for voters, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=34.1s)]
*  but for party leaders like Pete Buttigieg, who went from being a top Biden surrogate [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=39.7s)]
*  to a top Harris surrogate in hours. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=44.42s)]
*  Buttigieg is one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=47.66s)]
*  Nicknamed Mayor Pete, he shot into the limelight when he ran for president in 2020 as the mayor [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=51.82s)]
*  of South Bend, Indiana. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=57.1s)]
*  He then joined the Biden administration as Secretary of Transportation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=58.94s)]
*  But he's also frequently on TV as one of the Democrats' top messengers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  Reportedly, he's under consideration to become Harris's running mate. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=67.62s)]
*  If it happened and they won, he'd be the first openly gay VP. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  On Thursday, I sat down with Buttigieg to talk about how Biden's decision to drop out [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=76.22s)]
*  changed the race, what took so long, and what's next. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=80.78s)]
*  And if you noticed that I'm not calling him Secretary Buttigieg or asking anything about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=84.7s)]
*  his work in the cabinet, it's because there's a law, the Hatch Act, that prevents him from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=88.66s)]
*  mixing his day job with campaigning. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=93.06s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Pete Buttigieg. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=95.94s)]
*  This has been a shocker of a week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=108.62s)]
*  And now Democrats find themselves having to kind of build the plane while they're flying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=110.9s)]
*  it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  They're not just campaigning the race, they're having to introduce a new candidate, they're [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=117.3s)]
*  building momentum in the electorate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=119.34s)]
*  What have you found most surprising as you've been out campaigning for Vice President Harris? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=121.58s)]
*  Well, yeah, we've certainly had one surprise after another these last few weeks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  But what's been really interesting is to watch how she has built her campaign so quickly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=131.38s)]
*  Now, of course, part of that is that she was already part of the ticket. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=137.22s)]
*  She's already part of this administration. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=140.26s)]
*  The overall values are the same. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=142.58s)]
*  The themes are the same. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=144.5s)]
*  And yet, she did a lot more than just create a campaign organization or rebrand a campaign [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=145.7s)]
*  organization a day or two. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  You see her sounding themes that are distinctively hers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  And I think seeing that happen so quickly has been really impressive. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  And it is remarkable that there's been this sudden vibe shift, if you will, in the Democratic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=162.06s)]
*  Party since Biden dropped out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=167.38s)]
*  What do you ascribe that level of enthusiasm to? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=169.78s)]
*  Well, I think they're excited about what she represents as a messenger. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=173.26s)]
*  And it's been exciting to have a new focus on the things that we care about. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=177.02s)]
*  Part of what President Biden did with his very just extraordinary historic selfless [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=183.58s)]
*  choice was he tore down some obstacles that stood between voters and the media and commentators [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=188.02s)]
*  and all of us and focusing on a lot of the issues and the values that I think can propel [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  Democrats to victory. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=200.36s)]
*  And what I mean by that is all of the things that the election is really about. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=201.4s)]
*  The chance to have an election that is not just about two candidates, but is about us [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=204.8s)]
*  and how the choices that are going to be made by the next president affect our lives. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  That's something that is coming through with a new clarity right now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=216.8s)]
*  And that, as you described, vibe shift is really extraordinary. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=221.96s)]
*  There's been kind of a level of joy to the campaign that I think is welcome, not that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  it won't have incredibly tough moments in the weeks ahead, I'm sure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  But it's become yet another point of contrast, I think, between our ticket and the Republican [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  ticket, which seems to really lean into this death match conception of what politics is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  Tear down obstacles. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the obstacle many would say was President Biden himself to this moment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  A New Times poll shows that over 80% of voters are happy that Biden dropped out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=255.36s)]
*  Clearly voters were hungering for something different. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=262.64s)]
*  I mean, why did the party ignore that desire for change for so long? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=264.88s)]
*  Well, I think this is something the party was wrestling with for a long time. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=269.16s)]
*  And then the president wrestled with it personally. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=273.4s)]
*  And then he did something that is, it is world historically rare for not just the leader [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=275.52s)]
*  but the most powerful person in the world to lay power aside. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=281.6s)]
*  And it was really moving to watch in his speech the way he explained his thinking and said [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=285.56s)]
*  that this is not about me, it's about you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=291.76s)]
*  But at the same time, I also think his choice consolidated his standing, his presidency, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=295.2s)]
*  and his legacy in a way that makes me proud of him. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=299.88s)]
*  I want to talk about that decision, but I first want to just ask you about how the decision [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  came about because, you know, CNN reported that there haven't been any full cabinet meetings [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  since late last year. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  And so I don't know how often you were meeting with President Biden himself, but as a surrogate, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=316.6s)]
*  did you not have any questions or doubts about his abilities? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=321.24s)]
*  You know, last time I was working with President Biden really closely was during a disaster [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  a few months ago. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=331.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm reminding myself I'm not supposed to appear in my official capacity, so I won't delve [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  into that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=336.12s)]
*  But look, nobody's denying that he's 10 years older than he was 10 years ago. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=337.48s)]
*  And unlike what you see in the Trump personality cult, we're not going around saying that he [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=341.6s)]
*  leaps tall buildings in a single bound and as strong as an ox. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=346.16s)]
*  The point is that he's really good at being president and in my view still is. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  Hearing you, you have framed it as he sacrificed for his country, that this was a noble act. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  But the reality was that he was facing sliding polling numbers. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=362.52s)]
*  He saw a defection of donors and members of his party. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  He could have made that choice weeks ago, giving Vice President Harris or any eventual [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=370.4s)]
*  nominee a much longer runway and time to defeat Donald Trump. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=375.52s)]
*  And he didn't do it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=380.2s)]
*  Did he wait too long? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=381.2s)]
*  One of the things you sign up for when you go into politics and certainly when you're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=382.68s)]
*  in high office is everybody else telling you what you should have done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=386.28s)]
*  We can all say he should have done this or he should have done the same thing but a different [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  time or should have done it in a different way. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=394.24s)]
*  But the fact stands that he did an extraordinary thing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=396.72s)]
*  In my view, a selfless thing and in my view, the right thing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=400.66s)]
*  You know, we in the media were raising legitimate questions about Biden's age and his ability [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=404.92s)]
*  to run. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=411.36s)]
*  And yet reporters were being excoriated by the campaign for asking those questions and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  by Biden in public. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=418.06s)]
*  How do those attacks on the press sit with you now knowing what we know? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=420.04s)]
*  Well, look, I've never participated in an attack on the press. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=424.28s)]
*  I think that it is natural to feel strong, passionate, defensive even about the person [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=429.4s)]
*  you believe in when you feel like they're being attacked, especially when you feel like [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=435.28s)]
*  they're being attacked unfairly. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=438.32s)]
*  And there are a lot of moments where there's a sense... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=440.1s)]
*  But it wasn't unfair. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=441.84s)]
*  Well, certain dimensions I think were unfair. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=442.84s)]
*  For example, the fact that in a given day you might have almost identical flubbing of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=444.68s)]
*  names by the two major candidates, but only one of them would have that be kind of plastered [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=449.64s)]
*  in certain people's commentary. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=456.32s)]
*  So there was a sense and look, again, it's the nature of being passionate about the person [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=457.92s)]
*  you believe in to come to their defense. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=462.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, what happened was one of the most extraordinary and rare things [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=465.06s)]
*  ever. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=469.56s)]
*  And look, I say this as somebody who has, I have launched campaigns. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=470.56s)]
*  I know what it's like to end the campaign. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=473.84s)]
*  And I also know that he did what he feels like is the right thing and what I think is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=476.56s)]
*  a decision that will allow him to concentrate on the presidency and allow the campaign and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=483.36s)]
*  the party to concentrate on the campaign. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=490.08s)]
*  We've seen just Democrats rallying around the VP and we started this conversation by [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=493.8s)]
*  talking about how quickly everything has coalesced. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=499.24s)]
*  There was a lot of discussion in the weeks after Biden's disappointing debate about what [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=503.28s)]
*  another nomination process could look like. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=511.0s)]
*  And at the end, it just doesn't seem like there has been any appetite for an open convention, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=514.38s)]
*  a more competitive process among Democrats. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=519.36s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=521.8s)]
*  I think a lot of people looked at her, looked at what she brought, looked at the importance [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=524.12s)]
*  of quickly bringing the party together and reach that conclusion that backing her was [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=528.6s)]
*  the best way to do that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=535.28s)]
*  And again, I know a little bit about this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=536.28s)]
*  I remember making the toughest decision of my personal political career, which was the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=538.68s)]
*  decision to end my presidential campaign and realizing that even though I wasn't a candidate [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=543.36s)]
*  anymore, what I did mattered. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=548.64s)]
*  And I had a responsibility to try to do what I could to lead to a good outcome. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=550.0s)]
*  That led me to decide very quickly to back President Biden's campaign. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=554.92s)]
*  And this felt like a similar moment where, you know, whether it was by dint of being [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=561.0s)]
*  in office or just being somebody with a platform, there were a lot of people who had a lot of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  influence and therefore a lot of responsibility. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=569.68s)]
*  And just about everybody decided the best way to use that influence and responsibility [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  was to help bring the party together quickly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=576.36s)]
*  I mean, it's good politics. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you think people actually came to these conclusions individually? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=580.12s)]
*  Was there a sense from the party leadership that everyone needed to fall in line? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=584.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, Democrats are not exactly famous for falling in line when we do something like [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=591.0s)]
*  coalesce that quickly. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=598.0s)]
*  I think it's because there's a real sense up and down and throughout the party that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=599.0s)]
*  it's the right thing to do. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=602.9200000000001s)]
*  I've actually, I'm not sure I've ever seen us this quickly unify around anything. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, switching up the ticket has offered Democrats this chance to reset not just on [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  the person, but on the message and the policies. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=615.28s)]
*  President Biden, for example, has taken a lot of heat for his handling of the war in [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=618.04s)]
*  Gaza, inflation, the border. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  Would you like to see the Harris campaign differentiating itself on those particular [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=625.4799999999999s)]
*  issues? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=630.04s)]
*  Well, I'll leave it to her to indicate where there will be continuity and where she might [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=631.04s)]
*  have a different approach or maybe just a different emphasis. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=635.32s)]
*  What would you like to see? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=637.84s)]
*  Well, I'd like to see her reach those concerns that Americans have. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=640.96s)]
*  So on something like inflation, for example, I think she's well positioned not just to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=646.16s)]
*  explain how she's contributed to the work that brought inflation back down to 3% in [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=650.72s)]
*  this country, but also the difference between her economic proposals and the clearly inflationary [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=655.36s)]
*  proposals of Donald Trump. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is really important because it's actually an example of any of the issues you [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=662.92s)]
*  just mentioned, where even if there is impatience among the American people or the American [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=666.28s)]
*  people don't think we got it perfectly right, even on these issues, they disagree with Donald [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=671.08s)]
*  Trump's approach and on terms of what to do next would generally favor what we propose [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=677.2s)]
*  more than what he proposes to do next. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=683.12s)]
*  What you're saying, I mean, nothing has fundamentally changed about the Democratic message here, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=685.56s)]
*  which is that things are getting better, that inflation has gone down under President [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=689.64s)]
*  Biden. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=695.0s)]
*  I mean, that's been something that the Democratic Party has been trying to run on and push over [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=696.0s)]
*  and over and over again. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=699.36s)]
*  And yet, poll after poll shows that more people trust former President Trump on these issues [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=701.52s)]
*  than President Biden. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=707.04s)]
*  Are you suggesting that now because it's a new candidate, Kamala Harris can reset and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=709.0s)]
*  people will just forget that she was part of the administration? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=713.52s)]
*  What I'm saying is that part of what a candidate does, part of what a messenger does is convince [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=718.04s)]
*  people of things. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=723.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think she's a very convincing leader. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  There's been this discussion about how to define Kamala Harris now, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=728.64s)]
*  And so part of what Democrats like yourself and others are trying to do is show her for [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  who she wants to be as the next president of the United States. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  And the right, meanwhile, is trying to portray Kamala Harris as this far left extension of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=745.16s)]
*  the failures of the Biden administration. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=750.08s)]
*  And they're also using a lot of sexist and racist attacks. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=753.16s)]
*  They're calling her a DEI hire and worse stuff that I don't want to repeat. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=757.6s)]
*  And I just wonder as a surrogate, how you combat that? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=762.72s)]
*  Well, I do think that those attacks have been a bad look for Republicans. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=766.76s)]
*  And you can tell because when you got somebody like Mike Johnson, who is a very, very conservative [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=771.04s)]
*  figure, right? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=777.12s)]
*  The Speaker of the House telling his own caucus, like, hey, cool it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=778.12s)]
*  He's basically saying that they are embarrassing the party. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=783.24s)]
*  And I think acknowledging that they are diminishing the party's chances by indulging in that kind [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=786.2s)]
*  of rhetoric. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=791.56s)]
*  The fact that they can't think of what else to do besides go right to race and gender [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=792.56s)]
*  isn't just revealing about some of the ugliest undercurrents in today's Republican Party. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=802.5999999999999s)]
*  It's also just profoundly unimaginative because it means that they can't speak to how any [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=807.7199999999999s)]
*  of this is going to make people's lives better. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=813.68s)]
*  In other words, certainly not Trump's campaign or Trump's party. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=817.28s)]
*  They can't conceive a politics that isn't just about the personalities. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=821.48s)]
*  So everything he does is he beats his chest about his own persona and he tears down his [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=824.96s)]
*  opponent. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=830.72s)]
*  None of that is about us. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=832.38s)]
*  None of it's about you. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=833.96s)]
*  And that's again why their inability to do that, their inability to explain how your [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=834.96s)]
*  life as an American every day will be any different, certainly any better, is revealed [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=838.96s)]
*  in the fact that they immediately reach for one of two things. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=843.6800000000001s)]
*  The same she's too far left, which is what literally every Republican says about literally [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=847.16s)]
*  any Democrat who is running against the Republicans. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=851.4s)]
*  If Joe Manchin were the nominee, they'd say the same thing about him. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=853.68s)]
*  It's just standard and therefore boring. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=856.72s)]
*  Or these really ugly attacks, which maybe are meant to get attention, but they are very [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=859.52s)]
*  much telling on themselves when they go there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=866.28s)]
*  Okay, Pete, you are clearly one of the party's best communicators. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  You can deliver a message. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=874.4s)]
*  You have been very on message while we've been talking. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=875.48s)]
*  I am thinking about how you see your role right now because, you know, while Biden rarely [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=879.5799999999999s)]
*  talked to the press, you not only engage with people like me, but you also go to Fox News. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=886.54s)]
*  And I am wondering why you do that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=894.56s)]
*  What is it about taking the message there that you find could move the needle? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=897.26s)]
*  Well, the reason I think it's so important to take the message there is because I know [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=903.02s)]
*  that there are so many people who tune in in good faith. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=907.5s)]
*  I don't always feel that the corporation that runs Fox News is acting in good faith, but [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=913.26s)]
*  I know that the viewers, because they're people I know, I mean, my neighbors in Michigan, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=918.02s)]
*  might be tuning in in good faith and getting their information from this news source. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=922.8199999999999s)]
*  So I, as a political figure, can hardly blame a voter for not being responsive to our message [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=927.78s)]
*  if they literally have never heard it. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=940.06s)]
*  And we're in a very fragmented environment. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=943.12s)]
*  Honestly, we're lucky if we can get to somebody through TV versus just even more fragmented [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=944.74s)]
*  Internet sources. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=950.3s)]
*  And I know that if I'm on that network, I'm one of relatively few voices with our message. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=952.22s)]
*  So if I didn't go there to give that message, somebody might literally never hear it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=957.02s)]
*  I also know that you cannot assume who somebody is or how they're going to vote just based [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=960.78s)]
*  on what network they watch. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=965.58s)]
*  Of course, there's a lot of strong patterns, but there's a lot of people who can be moved. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=967.02s)]
*  And sometimes the person who picked the channel is not the same as the other person who's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=974.3000000000001s)]
*  also in the house who's listening to what's being said. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=978.26s)]
*  And so I think there's a responsibility to take this message into those spaces. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=980.88s)]
*  When I was running for president, I did it geographically too. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=986.84s)]
*  And in Iowa, I really kind of specialized in counties that had voted for Barack Obama, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=989.52s)]
*  but then had turned around and voted for Donald Trump. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=995.0s)]
*  And those counties were ones where I did well in because they were ready to listen. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=997.56s)]
*  Because they suddenly became more progressive or because I pretended to be a full-throated [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1000.88s)]
*  conservative. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1006.76s)]
*  But just because sometimes when you explain what you believe to somebody, even if they [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1007.76s)]
*  don't completely agree with you, they respect you more and are inclined to maybe trust you [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1010.0799999999999s)]
*  and give you the benefit of the doubt. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  So that's why I'm there. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1016.28s)]
*  Do you think the vice president should go on Fox? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1018.12s)]
*  Do you think she should debate on Fox? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1021.0s)]
*  I would be skeptical of the fairness of a debate hosted by Fox, but that's a decision [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1023.1999999999999s)]
*  that I'm sure she and the campaign will think through. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  I do want to ask you about a specific shift in messaging I've noticed this week from the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1034.48s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1040.72s)]
*  The Harris campaign is leaning into the idea that Trump is, quote, weird. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1041.72s)]
*  I've seen this weird word floating around. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1045.3200000000002s)]
*  It's very different from the way Democrats had framed him before, which is that he's [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1048.88s)]
*  an existential threat to democracy, this terrifying figure that is going to take away people's [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1054.28s)]
*  rights. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1059.48s)]
*  Weird seems a different tact than that. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1060.8000000000002s)]
*  What do you think of that strategy of basically laughing at him? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1064.2s)]
*  Well, to be clear, I think we're doing both. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1068.48s)]
*  We're talking about the implications for democracy and noting that he is obviously [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1071.36s)]
*  a strange person who's getting stranger. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  I think one of the things that, especially now that we have a generational difference [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1079.1999999999998s)]
*  between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, who's a generation older, is that we're watching [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1083.9599999999998s)]
*  his trajectory. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1090.32s)]
*  Not that he was ever the most disciplined and straightforward person, but four years [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  ago, even I would be still taken aback if he was rambling about electrocuting sharks [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1097.4s)]
*  and all these other things you see him doing that really are weird. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1104.48s)]
*  You got to ask yourself, is that the kind of person you want in charge of the country? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  Especially because we saw how not just weird, but chaotic it was last time. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1113.44s)]
*  Part of the promise of a Kamala Harris presidency is actually the prospect of a comparatively [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1118.1200000000001s)]
*  normal Republican party. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1125.56s)]
*  What I mean by that is beating Donald Trump the first time in 2020 ended his term, but [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1128.48s)]
*  it did not end his grip on the GOP. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1136.08s)]
*  Beating him twice would, I think, have a different effect on a lot of people in the GOP who know [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1139.96s)]
*  better than to be on board with him. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1144.96s)]
*  He goes against their values too, not just my values, but they've gone along with it [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1146.24s)]
*  because they think it's the path to power. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1149.58s)]
*  It would become abundantly clear that that is not true if we beat him not just the way [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1152.2s)]
*  we beat him in 2020, not just the way we indirectly beat him in 2022 in the midterms, but beat [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1156.52s)]
*  him a second or so to speak, third time. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1161.72s)]
*  We will always have fierce and meaningful disagreements between Democrats and Republicans, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1167.16s)]
*  but there's a chance of that difference, those debates being a little less ugly, or to put [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1171.28s)]
*  it another way, a little less weird. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1179.48s)]
*  What I'm hearing you say, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that if Donald Trump is [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1183.64s)]
*  defeated in this election, then perhaps the Republican party can be freed from his grip? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1188.04s)]
*  I think so. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1195.32s)]
*  I think so. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1196.72s)]
*  Look, I made myself watch the first couple Republican presidential debates, and we still [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1197.72s)]
*  had a lot of Republican candidates this cycle. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1202.08s)]
*  There were still some things that I thought were pretty fringe, and just about everything [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1207.52s)]
*  I heard I disagreed with. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1212.4s)]
*  But apart from some of the darkness of Vivek's populism, most of what you saw on there, you [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1214.28s)]
*  could be forgiven for thinking you were looking at a more normal Republican party, were it [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1222.16s)]
*  not for the fact that the entire thing was an undercard because Donald Trump wasn't there [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1226.56s)]
*  and he was and is dominating the party. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1230.16s)]
*  Look, we have fooled ourselves many times before into thinking that the fever would [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  break. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1237.44s)]
*  We thought it would happen before he was elected, when the Access Hollywood tape revealed that [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1238.56s)]
*  he had boasted about sexual assault. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1242.2s)]
*  We thought it would happen when he was defeated, but he wasn't in 2016. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1245.2s)]
*  We thought it might happen after January 6, and it very, very nearly did. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1250.66s)]
*  So many of the people who are now kissing up to him basically turned their back on him [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  and we got so close to the fever breaking, but it didn't quite break because Republicans [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1261.84s)]
*  found that their access to power still depended on their standing with Donald Trump. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1267.72s)]
*  If he leads this party to defeat a third time after his defeat in 2020 and his party's defeat [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1275.78s)]
*  in 2022, I believe that the self-interest, just the internal power dynamics of the GOP, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1281.8799999999999s)]
*  the very power dynamics that have kept them enthralled to him, even though so many of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1287.92s)]
*  them know better, notably including, by the way, JD Vance, who back when he was speaking [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1292.04s)]
*  truthfully and for himself, referred to Donald Trump as an idiot and compared him to an opioid, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1297.44s)]
*  which is an exceptionally dark thing to say about somebody if you are from or connected [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1302.68s)]
*  to Appalachia as JD Vance is. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1307.3200000000002s)]
*  That was in public and private comparing him to Hitler and now turning around and supporting. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1309.96s)]
*  My point is all of that finally breaks loose if they realize that attaching yourself to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1313.28s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't just destroy your character, it destroys your access to power. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1320.16s)]
*  You know, you've talked about this fever breaking that you have an appetite for, but we just [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1329.48s)]
*  had an assassination attempt against former President Trump and he got off off the floor [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1334.3999999999999s)]
*  and he raised his fist in the air with the American flag waving in the background and [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1340.0400000000002s)]
*  he said, fight, fight, fight. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1344.88s)]
*  And his popularity now in more recent polls has gone up. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1346.5200000000002s)]
*  People see him as someone who takes his licks and keeps on ticking. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1351.8200000000002s)]
*  And that speaks to, for some people, real fundamental American values about being tough [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1356.8000000000002s)]
*  and not caving into intimidation. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1363.72s)]
*  And so I'm just wondering if you think that a moment like that, you know, really breaks [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1367.04s)]
*  through to people and makes him seem fundamentally different than the way that you're describing [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1373.1599999999999s)]
*  him, which is weird and aging and vindictive, et cetera. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1378.2s)]
*  Well, I think lots of things can be true at the same time. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1381.1599999999999s)]
*  That was an extraordinary image and it is true that he was injured in an attempt on [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1384.48s)]
*  his life and he got right back up. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1389.8s)]
*  And that's why that image is so powerful. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1392.86s)]
*  But it doesn't change the fact that he has shown himself to be vindictive and backward [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1396.58s)]
*  looking and more interested in his past than in our future. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1403.06s)]
*  And I would add there was a moment in the wake of that horrifying moment. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1407.9399999999998s)]
*  There was a sense that he would follow that up by taking the stage at the RNC in Milwaukee [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1413.4199999999998s)]
*  demonstrating his capacity to help bring this country together. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1420.02s)]
*  And for a few minutes, he stuck to the script and it looked like that was going to happen. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1423.4s)]
*  And then the next hour and a half happened. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1427.74s)]
*  And it was as backward looking and rage filled and self-obsessed as anything he would have [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1430.94s)]
*  been saying one year or three years or five years ago. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1436.5s)]
*  We are with Pete Buttigieg after the break. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1446.46s)]
*  You mentioned JD Vance and I do want to also ask you about him. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1468.22s)]
*  Even though your politics are very far apart, you do share a lot on paper. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1473.82s)]
*  You're both Midwesterners, you both served in the military, you ended up in elite places [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1479.6599999999999s)]
*  for school, and then you spent time in the business world before becoming politicians. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1483.82s)]
*  Does that give you any special perspective on him as a person? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1489.98s)]
*  Well, I've certainly encountered a lot of people like him. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1492.86s)]
*  I think he and I both or each emerged at a time when a lot of people in the Midwest began [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1498.06s)]
*  to find that commentators and figures from the coasts were kind of approaching our part [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1504.82s)]
*  of the country almost like we were these kind of almost with exotic fascination. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1515.94s)]
*  And at least in my case, I sought to engage that attention as a way to bring support to [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1523.38s)]
*  the city that I was leading as mayor, that I was trying to inspire people to believe [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1529.5s)]
*  in because there's actually a lot of creativity and innovation. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1533.1000000000001s)]
*  I think in a different way, he chased that same vibe. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1536.5s)]
*  It seems to have led him to Silicon Valley. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1540.46s)]
*  But then it led him to this place where he's advancing a vision that is terrible for places [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1543.5400000000002s)]
*  like where I come from, and I would argue where he comes from. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1551.22s)]
*  But the other thing I would say is he has traded on fascination about Midwestern stories [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1555.46s)]
*  and Midwestern values. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1560.78s)]
*  But the most important Midwestern value I know of is to be straightforward, to be true [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1563.06s)]
*  to yourself, to be true to your core. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1569.58s)]
*  And because he spoke unequivocally about how sinister and unfit Donald Trump was just a [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1573.78s)]
*  few years ago, only to flip around, embrace him and be on his ticket so that he can have [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1580.82s)]
*  more power. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1586.82s)]
*  People are wondering if he has any core at all. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1588.7s)]
*  Have you read Hillbilly Elegy? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1591.8999999999999s)]
*  It's one of those books that I own but haven't read. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1594.7s)]
*  Just to be honest, I've dipped into it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1599.4199999999998s)]
*  I haven't read it cover to cover. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1603.22s)]
*  Speaking of vice presidents, the next big decision of course for Harris is who her own [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1606.1399999999999s)]
*  VP is going to be. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1612.1s)]
*  And in a recent NPR-PBS Marist poll, I'm sure you know this, you are tied with Michigan [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1613.78s)]
*  Governor Gretchen Whitmer as the most popular person for the VP pick. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1618.9399999999998s)]
*  I know you're not going to tell me if you want the job or not, but do you think you'd [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1623.4199999999998s)]
*  be a good vice president? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1627.58s)]
*  I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk like that knowing that the person who needs [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1629.1399999999999s)]
*  to make that decision is the person who's going to make it and that's her, not me. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1634.98s)]
*  What I will say is I'm going to do everything I can to help her become the next president. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1640.5800000000002s)]
*  Would you like to be vice president? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1645.8600000000001s)]
*  Again, I don't think it's appropriate for me to wander down that path with you right now. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1648.18s)]
*  What would it mean though to have an openly gay vice president? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1655.7800000000002s)]
*  I think just as it does in the job I'm in now, just as it did as mayor or to run for [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1660.26s)]
*  president as someone who's openly gay, it means that what used to be an indomitable [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1665.46s)]
*  barrier isn't anymore. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1672.02s)]
*  As recently as 10 years ago, I think any knowledgeable person would have said that the idea of openly [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1674.82s)]
*  gay person pursuing a presidential campaign and getting anywhere was not just uphill, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1681.74s)]
*  it was preposterous. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1686.26s)]
*  15 years ago when I took the oath of commission to join the military, it wasn't just some [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1687.26s)]
*  unfortunate prejudicial norm, it was the law of this country that I would be fired for [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1693.94s)]
*  being gay. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1698.7s)]
*  That's changed and like anybody who is a first, I'm mindful of what that means and I try to [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1700.3s)]
*  live up to what that might mean to others. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1708.14s)]
*  It's not why I'm doing this work, but it's one more reason to take it seriously. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1711.06s)]
*  Whoever the VP is, identity is going to play a huge part in the race. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1716.22s)]
*  Harris would be the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1722.1799999999998s)]
*  I will say that many of the black and brown women friends that I have have said to me, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1726.34s)]
*  you know what, there's no way that you'll be elected. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1732.7s)]
*  There's like a fatalism there, a cynicism about just how far we've actually come as [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1736.1s)]
*  a country. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1742.98s)]
*  What would you say about that? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1746.02s)]
*  I completely get where that comes from and yet even in my short career and life, I have [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1752.94s)]
*  seen these impossibilities turn into realities. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1763.1399999999999s)]
*  Things that were again, not just unlikely, but would have been considered ridiculous [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1767.54s)]
*  have become the norm again and again and again. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1772.42s)]
*  And not the easy way, I mean, through struggle and persistence. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1776.18s)]
*  These things can happen, but if that isn't true, then why does she have to choose a white [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1779.98s)]
*  guy as a VP? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1785.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's who's being vetted. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1786.98s)]
*  Look, she's going to choose. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1789.3400000000001s)]
*  Nobody knows more other than maybe Joe Biden. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1790.94s)]
*  Nobody knows more about the vice presidency than she does. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1794.22s)]
*  Nobody knows more about the job of running women than she does. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1797.22s)]
*  That's not the question. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1798.8200000000002s)]
*  The question is about why does she choose if it isn't true that there is a concern. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1800.3400000000001s)]
*  But this is my answer. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1804.82s)]
*  What I'm saying is for very good reasons. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1806.06s)]
*  She knows what she's doing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1810.58s)]
*  She knows the job. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1811.8999999999999s)]
*  She knows what she wants and she knows the people out there who she's going to want to [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1813.02s)]
*  consider. But again, the other thing I would say and certainly about her future presidency, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1818.02s)]
*  which will be historic, is that before something like that happens, people always think it's [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1823.46s)]
*  impossible. So many people thought that in 2008. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1829.06s)]
*  Anybody who is going to be a first has to overcome that skepticism. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1832.7s)]
*  Last question. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1837.6200000000001s)]
*  I assume at this point, you know Kamala Harris very well. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1838.98s)]
*  Do you have any specific story about working with her or something about her as a person [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1843.82s)]
*  that you think voters should know? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1847.78s)]
*  I think people do know this, but she is not just impressive. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1850.82s)]
*  She's smart and funny. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1854.7s)]
*  And the best chances I had to see this were when I was very involved in debate prep. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1857.14s)]
*  I was asked to effectively play Mike Pence, which is a very strange psychological thing [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1862.98s)]
*  for me to do. But I'm so glad I got to do it because I got to see her in action. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1868.98s)]
*  And what I love is that that is coming through. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1873.18s)]
*  You know, so often you hear about politicians. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1876.5800000000002s)]
*  I really it is true sometimes I say, oh, this person's like really funny and loose, but it [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1879.3400000000001s)]
*  just doesn't just doesn't come through on TV. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1883.06s)]
*  Or, you know, this person's smarter than you would think just watching on TV. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1885.78s)]
*  Actually, what's interesting, not just TV, but the Internet has picked up on the fact [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1889.18s)]
*  that she has this great sense of humor. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1893.66s)]
*  And I think it's, by the way, also revealing that the GOP has tried to attack her for it [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1896.34s)]
*  and that's fallen flat. I mean, even just this idea of, you know, sending around images [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1899.86s)]
*  of her laughing as if her joy is something that, you know, looks bad when actually what [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1903.98s)]
*  looks bad is to be the the doom and death march Republican Party against [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1909.3799999999999s)]
*  a Democratic Party that on one hand is very clear eyed about the enormous stakes of this [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1915.1s)]
*  election and on the other hand is visibly enjoying ourselves right now. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1918.58s)]
*  Pete Buddha, Judge, thank you so much. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK87A_M9A0k&t=1924.9399999999998s)]
