# Megyn Kelly on 'Owning' Her Bias, Endorsing Trump and Her Lane in the MAGA Podcast Universe
**New York Times - The Interview:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760)
*  Last year on the night before the election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=0.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly did something she'd never done before. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=5.28s)]
*  Hi everybody. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=8.0s)]
*  She got up on stage at Donald Trump's final campaign rally and she endorsed him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=9.44s)]
*  Vote Trump and get 10 friends to vote Trump too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=14.64s)]
*  Megyn Kelly built her career in the mainstream media. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=21.12s)]
*  She spent nearly 15 years at Fox News. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=23.84s)]
*  Welcome to the very first broadcast of The Kelly File. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=26.16s)]
*  Where she earned a reputation as one of the channel's sharpest interviewers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=28.96s)]
*  What do you say to those who say you were so wrong about so much at the expense of so many? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=32.8s)]
*  Before she moved briefly to NBC. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  But that Trump rally speech was the clearest sign yet [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=43.52s)]
*  that Kelly has moved on to her next chapter. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Over the past few years, she's found a new lane for herself in podcasting and on YouTube, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=50.24s)]
*  where she has a daily talk show that fits squarely into the MAGA loving media universe. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  That's fake news. It's not reality. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  That was a bad question. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=62.72s)]
*  That was a great question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  That was a nasty question. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=64.88s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=66.0s)]
*  He will close the border. He will keep boys out of girls sports. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=66.8s)]
*  It's just one of the reasons why I was so interested to talk to her [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  about her professional evolution. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=72.88s)]
*  I had been rendered entirely toxic. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=74.8s)]
*  Her volatile relationship with President Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=78.08s)]
*  It was useful to him to have me as a foil. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=80.32s)]
*  And what she thinks some people, myself included, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=83.28s)]
*  don't understand about how the media has changed forever. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  I just think that mode of journalism is dying, if not dead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=90.08s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro, and here's my interview with Megyn Kelly. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Megyn, one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is because you're really forging this new path [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  and I think to fully sort of understand your career, I wanted to start early. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=113.12s)]
*  Before you were a journalist, you were a lawyer at Jones Day, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=117.12s)]
*  which is one of the toughest, you know, kind of notorious firms out there for being just like a big [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=120.64s)]
*  international law firm that only takes the best of the best. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=127.28s)]
*  When you walked through that door, were you a tough person? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=130.64s)]
*  Well, the practice of law definitely toughened me up, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=133.52s)]
*  because while I was always comfortable with public speaking, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=136.16s)]
*  I wasn't necessarily comfortable arguing and standing up for myself and coming under attack [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=138.96s)]
*  and being able to hold my own. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=145.44s)]
*  And so law school helped with that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=146.96s)]
*  And then before I went to Jones Day, I did two years at Bickle and Brewer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=149.12s)]
*  Same mentality, which is kill or be killed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=152.72s)]
*  And it was known for its quote Rambo litigation tactics. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  So when I was very young, 24, that was very sexy to me. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=160.4s)]
*  I thought that was extremely cool. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=164.16s)]
*  And I love the thought of what that could do to me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=166.32s)]
*  I thought that those guys would toughen me up, would take what I had learned in law school [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=169.28s)]
*  and bring it next level. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=173.12s)]
*  And they did. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=174.8s)]
*  I know there was a time when you were working days as a lawyer [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=175.84s)]
*  and then nights and weekends learning TV journalism. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=179.28s)]
*  What did you feel that you could do as a journalist that you couldn't do as a litigator? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=183.76s)]
*  I mean, have fun. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=189.68s)]
*  It was one thing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=190.96s)]
*  What did you like about it? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=193.04s)]
*  Oh, God, everything, everything. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=194.32s)]
*  I loved the storytelling. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=196.16s)]
*  I loved getting a story. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=197.52s)]
*  I loved having that extra nugget that nobody else had. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  I loved the excitement and the pressure, the EU stress, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=203.44s)]
*  which is the more positive stress you can invite into your life, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=207.28s)]
*  of having to be on, you know, of like the fight or flight instinct coming on, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=210.08s)]
*  you know, behind your neck, like the tiny hairs being up because you've got to go. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=215.44s)]
*  And there's not a second go at it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  You're live. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=221.52s)]
*  Go. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=222.4s)]
*  So I just felt completely alive. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  And I also felt that what I was doing mattered. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=224.96s)]
*  You know, one of the reasons I chose journalism [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=228.56s)]
*  when I was considering a second career was 9-11 hit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=231.12s)]
*  And I was 30. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  And I was watching TV that day having an unfamiliar emotion [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  watching some of the reporters, in addition to all the other horrible emotions [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=242.72s)]
*  that we were watching in the event. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=246.16s)]
*  And that was envy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=248.16s)]
*  I remember watching Ashley Banfield. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  She was so cool under enormous pressure and thinking, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=252.0s)]
*  she's doing us such a service right now, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  and you can't see her sweat under the scariest possible circumstances. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=259.12s)]
*  You could put a reporter. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=263.44s)]
*  And I thought, I want to do that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  In 2004, you get to Fox. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=266.64s)]
*  What were your politics then? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=269.84s)]
*  Did you feel attracted to the news organization because it was conservative [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=271.76s)]
*  or were you just thinking this is my way in? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=276.8s)]
*  It's the big time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=280.24s)]
*  The latter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=281.28s)]
*  I really wasn't political. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  I was raised a Democrat, sort of. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=284.32s)]
*  We never talked about politics in my household, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=286.4s)]
*  but I knew my parents were Democrats. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=288.08s)]
*  And my nana, God bless her, she lived to 101. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=290.32s)]
*  She used to say, Republicans are for rich people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=293.44s)]
*  We're not rich. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  She's from New Jersey. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  That's her New Jersey accent. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  So I just always thought of myself as a Democrat. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=300.96s)]
*  And then when I started practicing law, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  saw what was happening to my paycheck, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=304.55999999999995s)]
*  I started to get a little bit more fiscally conservative. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  And Jones Day had some more Republicans, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  more than I'd ever been exposed to anyway. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=312.88s)]
*  And so I started to be more open-minded to the right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  And then when I was getting into journalism, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  I met Bill Salmon, who was working in the DC office of Fox News. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=320.32s)]
*  I think at that time he was still a contributor. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=324.8s)]
*  And he said, you've got to get your tape to Kim Hume. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  I said, oh, I think maybe I'm too green. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=330.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=332.16s)]
*  I knew Fox was like a thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=333.04s)]
*  And he said, you're not too green. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=335.36s)]
*  And if you are, she'll tell you you are. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=336.8s)]
*  But I hadn't even given a thought to their politics. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  And Roger Ailes was the first one to say to me, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=342.72s)]
*  how did a daughter of two Democrats, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=346.16s)]
*  a nurse and a college professor, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=348.88s)]
*  wind up a fair and balanced person? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=350.72s)]
*  And he was not saying I want a Republican [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=354.0s)]
*  who does news the Republican way. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  And even when I was starting to anchor on Fox, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  he loved it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=362.24s)]
*  If I had a contentious interview with a Republican, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=362.88s)]
*  he never said, like, don't do that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=366.0s)]
*  And in fact, he told other anchors, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=367.92s)]
*  you should watch Megan. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=370.32s)]
*  Do more of that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=371.36s)]
*  Why do you think that was? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=372.8s)]
*  Because it was good TV or because he thought [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=373.92s)]
*  they should be challenged? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=377.12s)]
*  It's probably because it was good TV. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=378.88s)]
*  Roger loved Republicans and wasn't too keen on the Democrats. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  But he would say to me, make sure you smile a lot. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=384.88s)]
*  And he wasn't wrong about that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  because if you're all sharp elbows, it's off-putting. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=390.8s)]
*  And someone doesn't see anything in you to connect with. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=394.56s)]
*  But when I went out in the air for contentious interviews, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=398.16s)]
*  I always approached them with some much somewhat more [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=402.0s)]
*  of a prosecutorial approach. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  Even though I never was a prosecutor, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  people mistake that about me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=407.76s)]
*  It's just more how I am, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=409.76s)]
*  especially if there's somebody who I think is a villain. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=411.92s)]
*  And every time I did it, I only got rewarded. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=414.88s)]
*  I never got my hand slapped by Roger. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=418.16s)]
*  He did think it made good TV. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=420.8s)]
*  And that's the nature of broadcast journalism. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  It's helpful if you're dynamic on the air. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=426.0s)]
*  And if you have a knack for making electric moments, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=428.0s)]
*  ask Donald Trump. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=431.92s)]
*  This is something he knows instinctively. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=433.36s)]
*  But I would just follow my instincts. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=435.76s)]
*  If somebody was making me irritated [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=438.08s)]
*  and I felt that thing in the back of my throat, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=439.52s)]
*  across from an Anthony Weiner or as the case was, Dick Cheney, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=443.04s)]
*  I'd know it's time to double barrel it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=447.2s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So that approach became one of your hallmarks. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=449.36s)]
*  This thing of being able to call balls and strikes, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=452.8s)]
*  specifically on a conservative network against conservatives, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=455.68s)]
*  that was unusual. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  And in 2015, there was the very famous Republican primary debate. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=461.76s)]
*  And you had a question for Donald Trump, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=467.2s)]
*  where you asked him to explain why he had called women fat pigs, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=471.68s)]
*  dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=475.2s)]
*  And then he retaliated against you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=478.16s)]
*  His attacks were relentless after that year. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=480.72s)]
*  You've talked about this a lot. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=483.44s)]
*  But what I would like to understand in hindsight now, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=484.48s)]
*  why do you think he came after you? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=488.64s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Well, initially he was annoyed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=490.16s)]
*  I think it was sincere anger that night. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=494.08s)]
*  He did not appreciate that question. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=496.48s)]
*  And I think he thought we were friends. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=498.64s)]
*  So he was even more annoyed by it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=501.6s)]
*  He felt betrayed. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=503.6s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Why did he think you were friends? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=504.56s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK We'd been friendly, just through Fox. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=506.48s)]
*  He had invited me to a couple of the apprentice extravaganza. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=509.04s)]
*  I'd interviewed him quite a few times on Fox in my younger years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=514.32s)]
*  There was a very funny exchange, I think, in 2010, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=518.88s)]
*  where he let me feel his hair to see whether it was real. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=521.36s)]
*  I think he thought I was a fan. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think he thought I should be a fan. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=527.84s)]
*  You know, that I was at Fox, and I kind of looked like somebody [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=530.24s)]
*  who he would typically do well with. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=534.4s)]
*  And he kind of put me in this category of, she's on my team. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=536.8s)]
*  And while I had nothing against him, and I wasn't not on his team [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=541.6s)]
*  prior to that moment, as you know, as soon as they throw their hat [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=545.92s)]
*  in the political ring, when you're a straight news journalist, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=548.56s)]
*  it becomes somewhat adversarial. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  You're not on their team. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=555.6s)]
*  And in fact, you get paid to be somewhat abrasive toward them. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=556.88s)]
*  And so the relationship does change, just given the nature of what news people do. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=560.16s)]
*  So the week before that debate, I had been discussing not with him, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=564.8s)]
*  but with somebody else, the Michael Cohen statement that you can't rape your wife. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=568.56s)]
*  Michael Cohen had said this in defense of Trump, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=573.76s)]
*  who had been accused by his first wife, Ivana, of having raped her [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=576.56s)]
*  in the course of their first marriage or divorce, or in some explosive argument, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=581.04s)]
*  an allegation she later recanted. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  And I was knocking Michael Cohen for the ridiculous assertion [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=588.88s)]
*  that one cannot rape one's wife. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=593.12s)]
*  Well, he did not like that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=595.6s)]
*  Trump was watching, and he called me up, and he told me something to the effect of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=597.28s)]
*  he didn't want to see any more segments like that on the Kelly File. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=601.92s)]
*  And I told him he doesn't control the editorial on the Kelly File. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=604.64s)]
*  And he screamed at me and hung up on me. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=607.92s)]
*  This is the week before the debate. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=610.08s)]
*  And then he kept calling Fox executives and complaining about me. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=613.04s)]
*  I think his spidey senses were up that, you know, maybe I'm not in the friend camp anymore, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  and something could happen at this debate that might not be good for him. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=622.32s)]
*  Here's the second thing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  So in the beginning, I think he was genuinely angry. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think it quickly turned to he liked it as a storyline. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=630.24s)]
*  He wasn't wrong that it was good for him to show the world, and in particular, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=635.44s)]
*  Republican voters who felt disaffected or abandoned by the party, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  that there were no sacred cows for Trump, even in the Republican Party, even at Fox News, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  even in the primetime and Roger's chosen favorite anchors. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=650.8s)]
*  No one. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=655.52s)]
*  That he would fight anyone. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  You've talked a lot about what a terrible year that was, and having to go with armed guards and, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=658.88s)]
*  you know, having his supporters come after you. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=665.04s)]
*  Do you have sort of residue from that period? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  No. It was such an annoying nine months. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=672.64s)]
*  You know, I did not want to take an armed guard to Disney World. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=675.76s)]
*  I did not want this to go on and on. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=679.76s)]
*  I knew it wasn't good for me as a journalist, as a Fox News host, or as a person, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=682.24s)]
*  to have this level of acrimony constantly at me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=689.2s)]
*  And I desperately wanted him to just lay off. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=692.72s)]
*  So it was just a stressful time when you're just kind of waiting for somebody who's very angry [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=696.24s)]
*  with you and toying with you to, I don't know, get focused on something else, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=701.12s)]
*  or have those feelings wane enough that they're reachable. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=707.36s)]
*  In 2016, you and other female Fox employees accused Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=711.92s)]
*  And again, this is a pretty well-documented time in your life. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=717.6s)]
*  There was a movie about it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=720.0s)]
*  And ultimately, you were instrumental in getting him fired. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=721.04s)]
*  Did you feel at Fox that people were angry at you because of what you'd done, certain people? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=725.84s)]
*  Very much so, yes. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=730.64s)]
*  They weren't really angry about the Trump stuff. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=732.4s)]
*  They were angry about me not supporting Roger. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=734.88s)]
*  And they never got past it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=738.64s)]
*  I mean, in a way, I feel like my career there ended when I called Lachlan Murdoch to tell him [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=741.68s)]
*  the truth about how my relationship with Roger was when I was a first-year reporter at Fox. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=748.16s)]
*  They just, you have to understand, it's almost cult-like over there. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=754.96s)]
*  At least it was back then. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=761.2s)]
*  And he was the cult leader. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=762.8s)]
*  And you don't turn on the cult leader. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=764.64s)]
*  And so much more so than with the Trump thing, which I think everybody understood [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=767.36s)]
*  Trump, what he was doing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=772.4s)]
*  And there were some who took it personally. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=775.04s)]
*  Hannity and I fought publicly over what he perceived as my non-supportive Trump. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=776.64s)]
*  So that's not a surprise to anybody. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=781.36s)]
*  But for the most part, no one cared about that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=783.76s)]
*  It was the Roger thing that turned my relationships at Fox and just made it an impossible place for me to stay. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=785.92s)]
*  And so I knew I couldn't stay. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=791.44s)]
*  And I left. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=793.28s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK What was that call with Lachlan like, though, when you called him up and told him? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=794.16s)]
*  TAMARA KEITH When you asked me that question, I got a chill through my body. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  That's how big that moment was for me. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=804.56s)]
*  It's like one of the hardest, most complicated things I've ever done. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=808.16s)]
*  Because I really cared about Roger. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=812.48s)]
*  And we had gotten past his harassment of me. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=817.12s)]
*  Which, for the record, never led anywhere. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=821.76s)]
*  I did not submit to any of his advances. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=823.92s)]
*  And I had forgiven him. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  And he had done so much for me. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=828.48s)]
*  And I did not want to hurt him. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=830.16s)]
*  And I didn't like Gretchen Carlson, who was kind of looking for help, you know, in a way. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=832.24s)]
*  It was the whole question was, could he be this thing that she's alleged he is? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=838.0s)]
*  And I was really not inclined to help her and stick a knife in him. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=843.76s)]
*  So I did wrestle. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=849.12s)]
*  There was a long period where I wasn't saying anything about it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=850.32s)]
*  And people were saying, what's she going to do? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=852.4s)]
*  And I was under a lot of pressure from Roger's team and Roger and his wife to come out and say, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=854.0s)]
*  he's not this thing, and he's incapable of being this thing, which is what everyone was saying. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=860.0s)]
*  And I knew I did not have it in me to lie. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=866.0s)]
*  The real question was whether I should just stay silent and keep it to myself. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=870.08s)]
*  And I wrote about this in my book. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=874.72s)]
*  I was on the porch swing at the place we go to at the Jersey Shore. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=876.0s)]
*  And I was looking at a picture of my daughter who had fallen off the jungle gym. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=881.28s)]
*  And she had had something like 11 stitches in her head. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=884.88s)]
*  But she got back up to the same jungle gym she had fallen off of. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=887.76s)]
*  And I saw that picture. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=890.96s)]
*  And I said, I have got to call Lachlan Murdoch. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=892.4s)]
*  I have to call him. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=896.0s)]
*  It still makes me emotional because I have to call him. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  It still makes me emotional because it was something that I think changed lives in a lot of ways. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=901.84s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=907.76s)]
*  But including my own in a way that was not positive, mostly. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=911.6s)]
*  In some ways positive, but mostly negative. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=916.48s)]
*  I'm curious to know, in hindsight, what do you think changed? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=918.88s)]
*  Well, I think it blew up almost every friendship I had at Fox, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  which those friendships were important to me. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  I loved most of those people and didn't quite realize how strong the backlash would be. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, virtually everyone. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  There may be a couple of close friends stood by me and were 100% with me. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=942.0s)]
*  But it just was a before and after moment there. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  Anyway, the whole thing on the heels of that year of the Trump stuff, it was just a lot. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=950.4s)]
*  And I'm not generally a stressed out person. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=955.76s)]
*  I probably couldn't be in news if I were anxiety ridden. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=959.12s)]
*  But I was stressed out. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=962.4000000000001s)]
*  And I left for NBC as an escape. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=964.72s)]
*  I just thought it was going to be a kinder, gentler, my god, I sound like an idiot. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=968.88s)]
*  It's like I did no homework about anything. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=976.1600000000001s)]
*  Place to be. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=980.08s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=981.44s)]
*  It ended disastrously. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=982.64s)]
*  It was an even more stressful year. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=984.4000000000001s)]
*  So look, all those relationships at Fox have since repaired. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=987.28s)]
*  And I'm in a good place with my old Fox colleagues. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=992.0s)]
*  But it took a while. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=995.12s)]
*  I don't want to spend too much time here because I do want to get to today. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=997.28s)]
*  But you mentioned this in 2017, you went to NBC to host a daytime show, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1000.88s)]
*  that time at NBC, which was, as you say, so stressful and ended so disastrously [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  because of your comments about Blackface and Halloween. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1012.24s)]
*  Ostensibly, there was a lot of other things going on at that moment. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1016.48s)]
*  But ostensibly, that was the reason that you were. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1021.12s)]
*  Correct. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1024.32s)]
*  Bravo, which is owned by NBC, had a real housewife in Blackface Halloween costume. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1026.48s)]
*  She dressed up like Diana Ross and tinted her skin. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1031.44s)]
*  And there was a push to not cancel her, but get her in trouble. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1034.08s)]
*  And so we had a discussion on my show where I asked, when did that become unacceptable? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1037.76s)]
*  Because when I grew up in the 70s and the 80s, people used to do it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1041.76s)]
*  And it was considered OK. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1045.12s)]
*  And at the time I knew that, I knew that had been my experience. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1047.28s)]
*  I just didn't know that NBC had been airing shows with people doing it, like Scrubs. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1050.0s)]
*  There were so many examples. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1055.28s)]
*  But I didn't have it at the ready because I wasn't expecting like a huge controversy over it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1057.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1063.36s)]
*  At the time, I just thought- [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  Everyone understands that Blackface is racist. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1066.8s)]
*  Now they do. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  But when did it go from something that people used to do, you know, with impunity, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1071.44s)]
*  hello, Justin Trudeau, to something that will get you canceled? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1077.04s)]
*  And for me, you know, we talked about the two sort of joint traumas during the Fox years, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1081.44s)]
*  the late Fox years. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1085.92s)]
*  For me personally, that NBC, it dwarfed those. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1087.92s)]
*  So by the time that ended, I was like, this industry is a disgusting, toxic stew of hatred [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1092.24s)]
*  and darkness. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1099.92s)]
*  And why would I want to go back into it? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1101.28s)]
*  You know, now I have some money. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1103.28s)]
*  Now I'm with my kids. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I can raise my family. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1107.2s)]
*  Maybe this is the time I ride into the sunset and find a third version of me professionally. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1109.1200000000001s)]
*  Did you feel during that period that people were turning their back on you? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1116.16s)]
*  Like that, you know, because there had been this big flame out at NBC that just all that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1118.64s)]
*  world that you had inhabited had sort of rejected you? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1128.48s)]
*  Oh, well, I mean, I had been rendered entirely toxic. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1132.0s)]
*  So I guess I never really tested it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1136.08s)]
*  I wasn't out seeking jobs at that time, right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1139.2s)]
*  It wasn't like, gee, will anyone still have me? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  But I understood that I had been rendered toxic. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1144.24s)]
*  This was the moment when you've talked about this on your new show, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1147.76s)]
*  when you sort of decided the mainstream media is not for me. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1152.08s)]
*  I don't do well with bosses, as it turns out. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1157.92s)]
*  I'm not that easy to control as an employee. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1161.52s)]
*  I'm just kind of past the bullshit. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1164.4s)]
*  And also that the landscape had changed back in 20. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, I was on my couch, figuratively, all of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1172.0s)]
*  And the country was losing its mind. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1177.52s)]
*  That was peak wokeism. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1179.92s)]
*  You know, where when it came to race, when it came to gender, when it came to any LGBTQ, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  it was like we were going nuts. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1186.8s)]
*  And I am not a woke person. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1189.52s)]
*  It's my one of my core missions in life to defeat wokeism. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1191.52s)]
*  Anyway, there was no way I could go work for another broadcast news outlet [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1195.76s)]
*  that was going to be like NBC was. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1201.84s)]
*  I definitely couldn't go back to Fox. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1204.24s)]
*  That bridge had already been burned on my way out. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1206.24s)]
*  And I wasn't in a great place with the executives or the owners. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1209.2s)]
*  So it was like, what could I possibly do? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1213.6s)]
*  Like, what's an avenue available to me? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1216.24s)]
*  And that's when Ben Shapiro called me, who I think he would tell you, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1217.92s)]
*  I helped him make his name. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1222.56s)]
*  I put him on the Kelly file regularly and helped make him a star. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1224.8s)]
*  And he saw me down and out and he said, MK, this is a real lane for you. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1228.96s)]
*  And he was just saying it as a friend. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1234.0s)]
*  And I wasn't quite ready at first, but then he called me again and said, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  you got to get back out there. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1240.88s)]
*  And he said, why don't you come out here to the Daily Wire and just see what we're doing? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1242.8000000000002s)]
*  And I kicked the tires on this new lane and thought, this is what I want to do. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1247.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1254.16s)]
*  Because I was my own boss. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1255.52s)]
*  I could be in charge of all my own editorial. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1256.72s)]
*  No one could tell me what to do, what to say, what not to say. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  I could have long-form conversations about [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1264.8000000000002s)]
*  really tough issues that were bubbling up in the country at the time. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1267.68s)]
*  I didn't have to do it in a seven-minute segment or a three-minute segment, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1270.96s)]
*  like I used to have to do on linear television. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1274.72s)]
*  It was just a whole new world to me. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1278.32s)]
*  It was the Wild West to me. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  And I loved that feeling. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1282.56s)]
*  I mean, you've talked about finding a third version of Megyn Kelly [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1283.84s)]
*  with your new show, which is on YouTube. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1287.36s)]
*  Looking at the early days of your show, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1289.84s)]
*  it was very much like you were an anchor on television and now you look a lot looser. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1291.6799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1297.2s)]
*  I feel looser in the anchor sense. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1297.8400000000001s)]
*  But if you really want to make it as an individual in this lane [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1302.0s)]
*  without a platform supporting you, where they're tuning in because it's Fox News, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1307.92s)]
*  you just follow the person before you who they really liked, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1314.3200000000002s)]
*  there has to be a connection between your audience and you. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, what's the point? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1320.24s)]
*  And so I did start to share more of my own opinions. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1322.3200000000002s)]
*  And frankly, I started to form more of my own opinions. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1325.7600000000002s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1328.96s)]
*  Form your own opinions. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1330.0s)]
*  Well, because I was never really that political, as I said growing up. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1331.2800000000002s)]
*  One of the reasons I think I did well at Fox in the news division was [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1335.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't really feel the need to choose a side. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1338.48s)]
*  I just felt the need to learn everything I could about both of the sides [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1340.3200000000002s)]
*  and then mediate a good debate. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1343.44s)]
*  Then it wasn't until really I got on this show that it was a different job. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1346.3200000000002s)]
*  It was more like they wanted to know what I thought. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1350.64s)]
*  That was clear. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1352.88s)]
*  The audience wanted to know my opinion. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1353.76s)]
*  And so on a lot of subjects, I had to really start thinking about them. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1356.8s)]
*  Even today, we're having a debate about tariffs. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1360.48s)]
*  I don't know how I feel about tariffs. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1363.6s)]
*  I've never really given it a lot of thought. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1365.12s)]
*  So I'm working on my opinion on tariffs. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1367.36s)]
*  But there have been a million subjects like that over the past four or five years [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1369.52s)]
*  that I've really just had to question where I stand. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1372.32s)]
*  One of the things that you just did, which is a red line for most journalists, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1375.28s)]
*  is that you showed up at one of Donald Trump's rallies right before the election [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1380.08s)]
*  and you formally endorsed him. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1387.36s)]
*  Once you endorse a politician on stage at a rally, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1390.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can reasonably be called independent anymore. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1394.48s)]
*  Or do you see it differently? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1397.6s)]
*  I think I can. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1400.96s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1402.24s)]
*  Because I can still hit Trump and do. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1405.12s)]
*  There's no question that I owned my bias on Trump and crossed a line [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1410.08s)]
*  that I had never crossed before and never would have crossed when I was still straight news, ever. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1414.24s)]
*  It's just this weird new hybrid lane I'm in that even made it a possibility in my mind, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1419.1999999999998s)]
*  that I even allowed myself to consider saying yes to the invitation. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1424.08s)]
*  And it was another before and after moment because for sure you're crossing a line. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1427.6s)]
*  But I had crossed it prior to then. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1434.0s)]
*  I had crossed it the day Biden handed down his Title IX revisions. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1436.0s)]
*  And I was so angry about what he did that I went on my show that day and said, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1440.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm voting for Donald Trump. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1443.9199999999998s)]
*  I've never done that. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1446.08s)]
*  But then going and actively campaigning, standing on stage and giving him a hug and a kiss, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1447.76s)]
*  it is different. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1454.08s)]
*  And I think a lot of people saw you endorsing Trump as caving, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1454.96s)]
*  as essentially going to where the power is. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1460.48s)]
*  I don't think it was me caving. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1463.04s)]
*  It was me rising. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  It was me answering something I truly felt called to do. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1465.76s)]
*  I'm thrilled Trump won. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1472.56s)]
*  I shudder to think of what the country would be right now if Kamala Harris had won. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1474.4s)]
*  And in the end, I had no qualms about going there, out there for him whatsoever. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1479.76s)]
*  And I accept and agree with you that there are different gradations. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1484.8s)]
*  It is a different level. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1488.4s)]
*  You know the symbolism of it, of course, which is someone who so famously had been at odds with [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1489.52s)]
*  him that he had done so much to publicly stand up and embrace him was significant to a lot of people. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1494.96s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1504.24s)]
*  I mean, that was my goal in helping him, especially with women. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1505.28s)]
*  And I wanted to look them in the eyes figuratively and say, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1509.2s)]
*  trust me, you know I'm pro-woman. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1514.32s)]
*  And you know I've expressed doubts about him in the past, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1517.44s)]
*  about some of the choices he's made when it came to dealing with women. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1521.2s)]
*  But there is no other choice for women in this election. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1525.04s)]
*  And I stand by that wholeheartedly for all the reasons I listed that night. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1528.32s)]
*  I knew that I could be of help to him. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  I knew, given the relationship with him, that I would be a different kind of endorser that actually [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1535.8400000000001s)]
*  might potentially make a difference for him with a certain set of people who were looking for [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1541.44s)]
*  permission to vote for him because they'd been told universally that he was bad, that he was Hitler, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1547.04s)]
*  that he was a rapist, that all these things that people have been saying. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1551.3600000000001s)]
*  And I felt the obligation to go tell them how I really feel about him and why I feel that way. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1555.2s)]
*  I understand the fervor within which you embrace some of his policies. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1562.08s)]
*  But what you were talking about there was the person, you know, himself, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1568.4s)]
*  the things that he has been accused of, credibly accused of, and what you yourself experienced. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1574.8s)]
*  I'll give you the perspective on it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1583.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1585.2800000000002s)]
*  So I don't agree with you on the credibly accused. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1585.6000000000001s)]
*  I actually don't believe that. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1587.68s)]
*  But with respect to my own situation, you have to zoom out and look what was happening at the time, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1589.68s)]
*  which was not easy for me when I was going through it. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1596.64s)]
*  But Trump was trying to win a presidential election. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1599.68s)]
*  And so, as I pointed out earlier, it was useful to him to have me as a foil. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1604.0800000000002s)]
*  Look, you have to separate when you're in this business, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1609.6s)]
*  you the person and you the professional. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1612.8s)]
*  Megyn Kelly the woman and Megyn Kelly the brand. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1615.6s)]
*  And they were attacking Megyn Kelly the brand, which is fair game. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1619.12s)]
*  I had thrown a very tough ball right at Trump's face in that debate. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1623.04s)]
*  Do you really think it's fair game that you as a journalist ask a fair question based on things [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1626.3999999999999s)]
*  that he'd said and he put you through that for a whole year? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1631.52s)]
*  You think that's fair? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1634.8s)]
*  Look, I've been very public about thinking he went too far. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1635.76s)]
*  That's how I felt at the time. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1639.3600000000001s)]
*  And if I could go back and undo it, I would. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1640.48s)]
*  But I have a better perspective on why it happened now. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1643.0400000000002s)]
*  It was actually an important piece of his rise within the Republican Party in the primary. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1646.88s)]
*  And it just showed people what a fighter he was. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  The same guy who got up bloodied in Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1656.0s)]
*  was the guy who was like a dog with a bone with me, who wouldn't let it go. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1660.48s)]
*  He's got this fighter instinct. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1666.5600000000002s)]
*  And if you cross him or if you do something he finds unjust, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1668.96s)]
*  he will stay on you until he's satisfied the things been resolved to his satisfaction. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1673.2800000000002s)]
*  I just want to understand something clearly. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1681.2s)]
*  Donald Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil court. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1684.0s)]
*  He's been accused by many women. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1687.8400000000001s)]
*  You don't believe any of that? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1691.44s)]
*  I think the most serious thing I've heard about him has been the E. Jean Caroll allegation [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1692.96s)]
*  that he sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf dressing room. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1697.2s)]
*  And I don't believe one word of that. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1700.64s)]
*  There are other women who have said. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1703.44s)]
*  I've interviewed some of them. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1704.96s)]
*  But look, the things I heard were included things like he got handsy on an airplane. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1707.2s)]
*  Now, I don't know whether that happened or it didn't. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1712.0800000000002s)]
*  But do I find that a deal breaker for a possible politician? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1714.56s)]
*  Not really. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1718.0800000000002s)]
*  At least I reported on their stories and did them the courtesy of bringing them to air [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  in front of millions of people and let the audience make up its mind. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1724.64s)]
*  My problem is more with these Democrats who will bury these allegations against their candidates [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1728.0s)]
*  or their candidate spouses and then play holier than thou when they're looking at Donald Trump. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1732.96s)]
*  Do you see yourself as a journalist still? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1738.16s)]
*  Or would you not describe yourself like that anymore? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1740.48s)]
*  No, I'm still a journalist. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1742.16s)]
*  I break news all the time. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1743.2800000000002s)]
*  And when I sit with Trump or anybody else in the administration, I ask tough questions. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1744.48s)]
*  As recently as September of 23, I interviewed Trump and he got so mad at me. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1748.72s)]
*  He didn't talk to me for six or seven months. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1752.96s)]
*  So it's not look, it's a tough job to do. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1755.68s)]
*  You have to be able to hit the people you admire. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1759.68s)]
*  And I do. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1763.04s)]
*  I've hit them all right before the election. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1764.32s)]
*  I ripped on Trump's Madison Square Garden rally as too bro-tastic and got specific about why. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1766.4s)]
*  You have to understand, if you haven't sold your soul, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1772.16s)]
*  you have to be willing to criticize the people even you that you admire on your, quote, side. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1776.88s)]
*  And my owning my bias by going out there on stage with Donald Trump and saying, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1782.56s)]
*  I'm voting for him and you should too, is a bonus when it comes to my credibility. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1786.8s)]
*  Now, everybody has zero doubt about where I stand and they can filter everything I say [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1791.6799999999998s)]
*  through the appropriate lens. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1795.84s)]
*  What typically happens in journalism is they say they have no bias and then they just work it out [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1797.36s)]
*  in the printed word or on their shows without owning it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1802.8799999999999s)]
*  But the audience knows it and it creates a distrust and a divide. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1806.1599999999999s)]
*  When it comes to Trump and me, no, my own personal opinion is most of the allegations against him [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1810.96s)]
*  are much more complicated than the mainstream media would have you believe. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1817.76s)]
*  And I don't think Donald Trump is a rapist or a sexual assaulter. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1821.1200000000001s)]
*  I do think he's taken inappropriate liberties with women and gotten handsy with them in a way [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1825.44s)]
*  he's owned himself. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1831.36s)]
*  Years ago when he was a celebrity, and it is what it is, that's the past. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1833.6s)]
*  But it's just about so much more than that. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1838.24s)]
*  We are talking about how many people dying at the southern border because of the invasion [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1840.72s)]
*  that we've suffered under Joe Biden. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1848.0s)]
*  We're talking about Laken Reilly, whose killer was let in under Biden. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1850.0s)]
*  We put him on a taxpayer flight down to Georgia where he murdered her. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1853.04s)]
*  I don't give a shit about Trump getting handsy with somebody 20 years ago. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1856.64s)]
*  I want someone who will close the border, which he has. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1861.92s)]
*  I want someone who will keep boys out of my daughter's sports, which he has. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1865.28s)]
*  I want someone who will stand up to the insane DEI policies so that white kids will stop [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1870.96s)]
*  hearing in school that they're born with some original sin from which they cannot recover, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1876.72s)]
*  which he has. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1881.52s)]
*  Do you think you could be at Fox now in the way that you were before? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1882.6399999999999s)]
*  Can I rein back in the opinion me and do what I used to do without sharing it as much and just [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  be straight down the middle? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1894.16s)]
*  If sometimes opinionated, I could, but I don't have any interest in that. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  I actually don't think that's the model for the future either. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1899.52s)]
*  Tell me what you mean by that. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1902.48s)]
*  I just think that mode of journalism is dying, if not dead. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1903.92s)]
*  I think the future involves direct relationships between individual journalists and their audience, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1908.64s)]
*  or personalities. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1915.28s)]
*  They don't all have to consider themselves journalists and their audience. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1916.72s)]
*  What's left of that happens? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1920.4s)]
*  The way that the algorithms work now is that, I agree with you, they elevate individuals, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1922.48s)]
*  that you have a personal relationship with them, but you're given more of the same thing that you [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1929.12s)]
*  want. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1934.64s)]
*  If I like Megyn Kelly, I might get Megyn Kelly adjacent materials. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1935.28s)]
*  So however great Megyn Kelly may or may not be, that is a very narrow slice of what's out there. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1939.28s)]
*  The reality right now, or the way it's been for the past three decades prior to the last couple [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1946.4s)]
*  of years, is everyone is siloed and they're all getting only leftist information. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1953.2s)]
*  There's the people who watch Fox and then everybody else. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1959.2s)]
*  There is a monopoly on opinion and political bias, mostly by the left in media. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1963.0400000000002s)]
*  A couple have popped up that have done all right. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1968.8000000000002s)]
*  Fox, they do very well. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1970.96s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is doing okay. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1972.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1974.5600000000002s)]
*  You've had talk radio, which was the only place conservatives could go to hear their ideas debated [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1975.36s)]
*  in a way that wasn't disdainful. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1980.9599999999998s)]
*  Now that lane has been broadened out to more radio and digital, where you have more conservative [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1983.76s)]
*  personalities dominating because necessity is the mother of all invention. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1989.04s)]
*  Because there are more conservatives in the country now than there are liberals. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1994.8s)]
*  The country's more right-leaning than it is left. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  Why wouldn't they be the dominant forces in media, in mainstream so-called media? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  There's a monopoly. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2005.2s)]
*  There's control. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2006.3999999999999s)]
*  There's control over sports. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2007.12s)]
*  There's control over corporate America. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2008.6399999999999s)]
*  There's control over media. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2010.24s)]
*  Republicans have had this one strain, and Fox News has been very important, but they [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2012.32s)]
*  needed to invent a new area of thought because even Fox wasn't enough and actually didn't [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2016.96s)]
*  represent all Republican voices. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2025.12s)]
*  I do think now that this other thing has been invented, the old thing is a dinosaur. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2027.9199999999998s)]
*  It's dying a slow and painful death. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2032.88s)]
*  Part of it is tragic because we do need reporters. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2035.44s)]
*  We need news gatherers. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2039.68s)]
*  And I am not somebody who says the time should go out of business. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2042.0800000000002s)]
*  I still subscribe to the Times. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2045.44s)]
*  I also subscribe to the Journal and I subscribe to the New York Post. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2047.0400000000002s)]
*  I think it's important to have news gatherers out there getting news. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2050.64s)]
*  And people like me cannot exist without that. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2054.88s)]
*  You know, I need content. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2058.48s)]
*  I need news to talk about and report on. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2060.64s)]
*  But the model for how that news is presented is deeply, deeply flawed. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2063.52s)]
*  And it led to me and it's going to lead to a much different future for those organizations. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2069.04s)]
*  After the break, I called Megan back. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2076.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us again today. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2082.7999999999997s)]
*  When we spoke yesterday, I was thinking a lot about our conversation. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2086.0s)]
*  And you were talking about how you still consider yourself a journalist, even though the way you [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2091.84s)]
*  do the work has sort of changed over time. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2095.2s)]
*  And so I did want to ask you as someone who supports the president, what you make of the [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2098.48s)]
*  various ways that he attacks the press from calling reporters the enemy of the people to sort of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2104.16s)]
*  popularizing the term fake news, sometimes calling out individual reporters. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2110.24s)]
*  What do you make of that dynamic? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2115.84s)]
*  I'm in favor of it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  I share his feelings. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2123.2s)]
*  Like most people on the right, I have a healthy amount of loathing for a large portion of the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2126.16s)]
*  media. And they are fake news. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2133.68s)]
*  And Trump did a very effective job of pointing that out. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2136.4s)]
*  And he had to because they were all against him. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2140.56s)]
*  So what was his choice other than to try to demonize them as a group? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2143.68s)]
*  And rather than proving him wrong, they leaned in and tried extra hard to really convince people [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2148.0s)]
*  of what he was saying. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2153.9199999999996s)]
*  That's what happened, especially over Trump 1.0. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2155.2s)]
*  He played a role, but it was really their decision. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2158.3199999999997s)]
*  But they needed a little bit of help. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2160.72s)]
*  And he provided it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2162.16s)]
*  President Trump has chosen a lot of people who are in the media, especially on Fox for [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2163.2799999999997s)]
*  his administration. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2168.48s)]
*  The most high profile, of course, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, whom you worked with, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2170.4s)]
*  Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2174.8s)]
*  There are many others. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2177.28s)]
*  As someone who spent so much time in that world, I'm curious what you make of that. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2179.28s)]
*  I'm excited about it. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2184.8s)]
*  Pete Hegseth is an interesting one. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2186.88s)]
*  And I would just say, like, he's a good example of what I was saying to you yesterday about how [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2188.56s)]
*  we have an approach that irrespective of who I voted for, we try to make it [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2193.52s)]
*  relentlessly factual. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2198.88s)]
*  When the allegations against him that he allegedly raped somebody came out, we sat on [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2200.6400000000003s)]
*  the show and went line by line through the police report. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2204.8s)]
*  And it was brutal. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2208.0s)]
*  We did not care that he was a Trump appointee. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2210.08s)]
*  We did not care that he was a former friend and colleague of mine at Fox. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  We read every single allegation against him and went through it with the audience with [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2215.76s)]
*  an open mind. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2220.0s)]
*  Good luck finding somebody else who did that. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2221.04s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2222.56s)]
*  You interviewed him. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2223.6s)]
*  And it was a fair interview, a tough interview. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2224.7200000000003s)]
*  But you opened it by saying that he was a friend. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2228.0s)]
*  You said, I've been really dismayed by the amount of pylon that he's been suffering. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  And I've been outraged by the unfairness of the media's coverage of the allegations. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2237.12s)]
*  And that's a direct quote. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2240.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I'm curious what you're doing in that interview because you're setting up the [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2242.16s)]
*  interview in a particular kind of way that perhaps it wouldn't be set up in the mainstream [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2247.12s)]
*  media. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2253.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2254.56s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you asked that because I feel like part of our discussion before and today [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2255.62s)]
*  is getting at something that our wires are crossing. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2262.18s)]
*  Your wires and my wires are crossing in a way. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2266.1s)]
*  Like you're kind of looking at me and saying, it's not behaving like a typical journalist. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2268.5s)]
*  And it is still calling itself a journalist. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2274.1s)]
*  And I'm trying to say to you, yes, I'm still a journalist. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2276.18s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2280.66s)]
*  I know I'm not saying you're judging me. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2281.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2282.9s)]
*  But I'm trying to say to you, yes, I'm still a journalist, but I'm in this new ecosystem [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2284.02s)]
*  where the old rules don't apply. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2288.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm in this world with, yes, Charlie Kirk and Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2291.62s)]
*  But my world is also Joe Rogan with these in-depth interviews and also Theo Vaughn. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2297.54s)]
*  And it's a very large world. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2304.9s)]
*  And how the consumer receives it is by going on YouTube.com on their television screen [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2306.58s)]
*  or going to the vertical integrations on Instagram or TikTok and just taking in content. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2313.54s)]
*  What's the content that you want to receive? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2319.54s)]
*  I'm on the list of content creators. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2321.22s)]
*  And so the fact that I'm also a journalist who breaks news and reports on news [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2323.14s)]
*  is like an extra. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2328.18s)]
*  But what's most important in my business now is authenticity. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2329.62s)]
*  That you are honest with the audience. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2334.34s)]
*  What do you make of Governor Gavin Newsom of California starting his podcast? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2336.9s)]
*  He had, I think Charlie Kirk is his first guest. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2342.5s)]
*  He's basically saying, like, if you can't beat him, join him. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2347.38s)]
*  And not too many words, like we need to figure out a strategy. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2350.34s)]
*  What do you see about that strategy? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2353.94s)]
*  I think he's very smart to do it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2356.6600000000003s)]
*  It's the right move. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2358.9s)]
*  And he'll probably be pretty good at it because he's been a public speaker for a living. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2360.5800000000004s)]
*  And he could really benefit, as I think most people on the left could, from having his ideas tested. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2366.5800000000004s)]
*  The right is very good at having these debates because they have to have them everywhere and [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2371.1400000000003s)]
*  they have for all of their lives. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2374.5800000000004s)]
*  And the left is less good because they've just had their worldview reinforced over and over. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2376.02s)]
*  And in this arena, it times 10, right? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2380.7400000000002s)]
*  Because that's all we do is debate all day, have people on, test our ideas, kick them around, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2383.38s)]
*  get embarrassed, try to correct it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2387.5400000000004s)]
*  Do better the next time, learn, grow, throw out yesterday's wrongness so you can be more [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2389.62s)]
*  right tomorrow, all that. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2393.54s)]
*  So he's late to the party, but he's right to join it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2395.22s)]
*  I think you're right that there is some way that we are seeing things or discussing something [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2397.94s)]
*  different, right? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2405.8599999999997s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to understand is what are the rules of this new world that you are inhabiting? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2406.98s)]
*  Are you sort of making them up as you go along and you're sort of seeing what it is? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2412.2599999999998s)]
*  Or do you adhere to some of those old values that you used to embrace? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2416.02s)]
*  The only way one succeeds in this medium is by violating all those rules that we used [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2419.06s)]
*  to have in journalism, where you don't really talk about yourself at all. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2425.7799999999997s)]
*  You don't talk about your opinions. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2429.94s)]
*  You might have a bias. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2431.7799999999997s)]
*  Your only goal is to hide it, not to own it and then get past it with the audience. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2432.9s)]
*  It's just a whole new world. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2437.86s)]
*  And it's okay. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2439.94s)]
*  We used to be much more partisan and openly partisan in our journalism and our media, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2440.9s)]
*  you know, 100 plus years ago. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2445.38s)]
*  And we survived that just fine. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2447.7s)]
*  And we will survive this just fine, too. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2449.9399999999996s)]
*  What the audience wants from me is my authentic self and no filter. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2452.74s)]
*  What they can smell from a mile away is a phony. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2457.8599999999997s)]
*  So they have no problem with me endorsing Trump, even if they don't like Trump. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2461.14s)]
*  What they would have a problem with is me pretending I don't have a horse in the race [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2465.7799999999997s)]
*  and going out and trying to deliver the news as though I'm completely objective and I'm [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2471.46s)]
*  just as open minded to Kamala as I am to Donald Trump. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2476.18s)]
*  Were you ever approached to get into the Trump administration? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2480.02s)]
*  No comment. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2484.02s)]
*  Well, let's just say I'm happy doing what I'm doing. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2485.22s)]
*  What did they approach you for? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2488.8999999999996s)]
*  Assumes facts, not in evidence. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2491.7799999999997s)]
*  But look, if I thought I could be really helpful to the president, you know, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2493.62s)]
*  it's not that I would never consider it, but Lulu, I finally have my life exactly as I want it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2497.62s)]
*  And I have no desire to upend it in any way right now. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2502.66s)]
*  That's Megyn Kelly. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2507.3799999999997s)]
*  She recently announced that her media operation is expanding. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2508.98s)]
*  She's launching a podcast network called MK Media. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2512.66s)]
*  Today, we are announcing the launch of MK Media. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2516.02s)]
*  Also, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been in the news this week for sharing military [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2520.2599999999998s)]
*  information over Signal with a group of White House advisors and inadvertently a journalist. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2524.8999999999996s)]
*  We recorded this interview before that story broke. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ2Eafg760&t=2530.34s)]
