# 'The Interview': James Lankford Tried to Solve Immigration for the GOP
**New York Times - The Interview:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=6.8s)]
*  At a campaign rally in Georgia late last month, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to supporters [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=8.76s)]
*  about one of the biggest issues in this election, immigration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=16.04s)]
*  She talked up her record as the former attorney general of a border state, and she made a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=20.36s)]
*  promise. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=25.84s)]
*  As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=32.48s)]
*  That bill she was talking about was negotiated starting late last year by a bipartisan trio [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=42.92s)]
*  of senators. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  The Republican in that group was Senator James Lankford, a former Baptist youth minister [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=49.08s)]
*  from Oklahoma. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=54.0s)]
*  Lankford clearly has big ambitions in the party. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=56.0s)]
*  He's currently running for Senate leadership. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=59.0s)]
*  And for months, he worked on that immigration bill with Kyrsten Sinema, the independent [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=61.32s)]
*  from Arizona, and Chris Murphy, the Democrat from Connecticut. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=65.84s)]
*  It was a rare show of bipartisanship, and after sign-off from both Senate party leaders [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=69.88s)]
*  and an endorsement from the White House, the bill looked like it was going to become law. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=75.84s)]
*  It would have been the first major piece of bipartisan legislation on immigration in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=80.84s)]
*  decades. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=85.72s)]
*  But then, Donald Trump came out against it, saying he didn't want to give Democrats a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=86.72s)]
*  political win on such a sensitive issue during an election year. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=91.36s)]
*  And even though the bill contained most of the hardline policies the right had wanted, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  it became toxic in the GOP. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=100.76s)]
*  In the end, only four Republican senators voted for it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  The bill tanked, and Lankford was left holding the bag. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=106.92s)]
*  I've covered the immigration system since the beginning of my career, so I really wanted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=110.6s)]
*  to talk to Lankford about his experience working so hard on this bill, only to see it fall [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=114.56s)]
*  apart, and what that failed attempt at bipartisanship shows about the possibility of getting anything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  done by a Republican party that is so beholden to Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Senator James Lankford. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=130.48s)]
*  Senator Lankford, before you were in politics, you ran the largest Baptist youth camp in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=134.0s)]
*  the country, Falls Creek. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=142.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=143.72s)]
*  You know, a friend of mine from Oklahoma basically said it's the place everyone goes when they're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=144.72s)]
*  young. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=148.72s)]
*  I think when you were elected, something like 40% of Republican primary voters in Oklahoma [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=149.72s)]
*  either went to Falls Creek or knew someone who did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=154.08s)]
*  What role did that organization play in your life? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=157.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=160.84s)]
*  That's a huge question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=161.84s)]
*  I'm going to spend about six hours talking this through to be able to catch up on it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=163.52s)]
*  real quick. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  I would say a couple of things. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  One is I served 22 years in ministry working with students in those families. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=169.36s)]
*  So when you work with middle school and high school students, you're engaging in ministry [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=174.84s)]
*  and life, and you're dealing with all kinds of trauma that happens in those families. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what I did, and what my wife and I did for 22 years to be able to just love on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  families and to encourage them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I didn't do anything in politics other than vote. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=190.4s)]
*  In 2008 and 2009, we really felt a calling to be able to run for Congress in the central [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=193.12s)]
*  district. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=198.16s)]
*  I had to go to our state Republican leaders and introduce myself and say, Hi, my name [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=199.16s)]
*  is James. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=202.4s)]
*  I'm filing to run for Congress. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=203.4s)]
*  They basically pat me on the head and said, that's nice. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=204.96s)]
*  Most of my friends said, is this a joke? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=208.0s)]
*  I would just say, it's actually not. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=210.28s)]
*  This is something I feel strongly to be able to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=212.74s)]
*  Saying all that, my faith is important to me, and it's not something I take off and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=215.12s)]
*  put on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=219.44s)]
*  I tell people all the time, your faith should affect everything about you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=220.68s)]
*  It's how I treat my wife. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  It's how I treat total strangers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=225.56s)]
*  It's how I drive. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=226.84s)]
*  It's how I interact with my staff. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=227.84s)]
*  It's how I take on issues. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=229.44s)]
*  I believe every person's created in the image of God, they have value and worth. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Even if I disagree with them, that person has value and worth. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=234.64s)]
*  My faith affects how I see people and how I interact on areas of disagreement, because [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=238.12s)]
*  I see them as people that we may disagree with. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=245.04s)]
*  As I joke with some of my Democrat colleagues, we're friends, but they're wrong all the time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=248.7s)]
*  They just vote wrong all the time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  But we can still be friends in our conversation and relationship and try to be able to engage [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=255.4s)]
*  in that idea. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  That's something deeply held in my own personal faith because of what I've been forgiven of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  and what I've seen God do in my own life. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=265.58s)]
*  Why wouldn't I allow other people, the mercy and grace, to have that happen in their own [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=268.06s)]
*  life as well? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=271.18s)]
*  So you arrived in the House as part of the Tea Party movement in 2011. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=273.82s)]
*  I did. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=277.38s)]
*  Then you were elected to the Senate in 2014. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  I remember that you worked with Kamala Harris, the vice president, quite closely in the Senate [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=281.86s)]
*  in 2017 when you crafted an election security bill around Russian election interference. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=286.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=291.94000000000005s)]
*  What was that work like and what was your relationship with her like back then? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=292.94000000000005s)]
*  She was a brand new senator coming in in 2017. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  We actually traveled to Afghanistan together, and so we did have the opportunity to be able [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=299.66s)]
*  to spend some time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=303.42s)]
*  Obviously, we have wide policy disagreements on things, but we were able to sit down and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  to be able to talk frankly, to be able to work through things, and always had a cordial [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=309.18s)]
*  conversation where I could say, this is my boundaries of where I think we need to work [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  And she would say the same, and we'd figure out how to be able to hit some common ground [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  on it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=320.42s)]
*  Obviously, that was challenging for us and for her. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=321.42s)]
*  She's very progressive. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=324.06s)]
*  I'm very conservative. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=325.06s)]
*  When I talk to people in Oklahoma, they'll say, I couldn't work with the people that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=326.06s)]
*  you work with. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=329.66s)]
*  They would drive me crazy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=330.66s)]
*  I just can't believe some of the things they say and always remind people, I don't pick [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=332.1s)]
*  the people I work with. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  Other people pick the people I work with. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  I just have to work with them, and we've got to be able to figure out how to do this because [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=340.86s)]
*  there's more to get done. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=343.54s)]
*  Speaking of working across the aisle, I want to talk to you about immigration, which is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=345.3s)]
*  one of the top issues of this election. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=349.86s)]
*  Why would you talk to me about immigration? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=353.66s)]
*  What would I know about it? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=354.86s)]
*  At the end of last year, you raised your national profile when you were tapped by Mitch McCormick [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  McConnell to negotiate a bipartisan border bill. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=361.62s)]
*  You worked for four months with Kristin Sinema, the independent senator from Arizona, and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=365.42s)]
*  Chris Murphy, the Democrat from Connecticut. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=370.3s)]
*  Can you tell me a bit about how you all moved through that process? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=373.3s)]
*  Kirsten Sinema is an immigration attorney in her past, and so she's extremely knowledgeable [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  about this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=384.1s)]
*  Obviously, Arizona is one of the epicenters of illegal immigration. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=385.1s)]
*  She was very engaged, very knowledgeable of the issues, and every time we talked about [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=389.58s)]
*  it, she could give a personal story of this is what it actually looks like on the ground. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=393.26s)]
*  This is why this is important to be able to resolve. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  Again, she grew up in southern Arizona, so she grew up with people crossing the border, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  but she could also say how different this is now than what it was 20 years ago, 30 years [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=404.82s)]
*  ago, who's coming, where they're coming from, and the threats that are there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=409.53999999999996s)]
*  Working with Kirsten was a lot of conversation about practical things, trying to be able [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=413.78s)]
*  to give context to it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=417.5s)]
*  Senator Murphy, he's a progressive from Connecticut, extremely smart, but it's a different perspective [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=419.26s)]
*  when you're from New England on dealing with immigration. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=426.5s)]
*  He was keenly aware of the criminal aspects of some folks that are coming across that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=428.78s)]
*  are real threats to national security. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=433.48s)]
*  He wanted to be able to focus in on those aspects, but he was also very outspoken the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=435.82s)]
*  whole time that he's very supportive of the Dreamers, and he wanted to be able to resolve [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=439.82s)]
*  a lot of bigger issues that have been there, which we weren't going to be able to make [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=445.74s)]
*  any progress on at this point. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=450.26s)]
*  There was a lot of dialogue back and forth about how do we actually find the areas of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  agreement that we can on the national security issues and not continue to make this so big [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=455.85999999999996s)]
*  that it falls under its own weight. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=460.06s)]
*  Ultimately, at the end of the day, we weren't able to find a bill that was actually ... I [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=461.7s)]
*  could get enough Republicans on board on to be able to move on it, but he was very successful [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=465.74s)]
*  moving Democrats to be able to say, let's work on national security. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=470.46s)]
*  We'll come back and work on other areas later. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=473.18s)]
*  You know, this was a very tough border bill. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=478.1s)]
*  There was no legal pathway to citizenship, for example, as you mentioned for Dreamers. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=482.1s)]
*  Why wasn't that included? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=487.7s)]
*  Did you think it was going to be basically a bill killer for the Republican side of things? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=489.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=495.3s)]
*  Quite frankly, I did believe that would be a bill killer, that it would not move through [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=496.3s)]
*  the House or through the Senate if that was included. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=500.42s)]
*  When you have two and a half million people a year that are crossing the border illegally, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=503.06s)]
*  when you've got millions of people in the backlog, the energy and the focus was, let's [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=507.26s)]
*  first stop the bleeding and then let's figure out how to be able to take care of everything else. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=512.34s)]
*  There will be moments to be able to deal with DACA and other issues. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=517.42s)]
*  It's not like that's not going to come up, but we've got to figure out a way to be able [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=520.9399999999999s)]
*  to make this stop right now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  And you felt that Democrats understood that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=527.18s)]
*  Eventually. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=529.22s)]
*  And the administration understood that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=530.22s)]
*  Eventually. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=532.98s)]
*  That was a long conversation, I would tell you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=533.98s)]
*  That was one of the most contentious areas of the debate all along that Chris Murphy [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=535.7s)]
*  never let go of. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=540.46s)]
*  He was very faithful to his perspective on that one to say, this is really important. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=541.46s)]
*  And I hear him that it's really important, but I also understood there was absolutely [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=547.66s)]
*  no way he would have a chance with the number of people that we're dealing with right now [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=551.38s)]
*  that are illegally crossing in the country, that the overwhelming sense is. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=556.3s)]
*  I hear from Republicans and Democrats alike in my state in Oklahoma. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=560.46s)]
*  How does this stop? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=564.78s)]
*  How does this get better? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=565.9s)]
*  You seem to have won every concession from Democrats that Republicans wanted. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=567.82s)]
*  And I'm curious now in hindsight why you think that's true. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=571.82s)]
*  Do you think Democrats and the Biden administration in particular realized that they had a problem [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=576.46s)]
*  on their hands at the southern border? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=582.9s)]
*  So yes, I believe that the administration came to the table because they understood [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=585.14s)]
*  that this is spiraling out of control. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=589.86s)]
*  And quite frankly, I think they perceived they could say, OK, those crazy Republicans, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=592.5s)]
*  they forced us to be able to pass this bill, so we're going to implement this when they [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  actually quietly wanted to say, OK, we got to make this stop. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=600.58s)]
*  What can be done to be able to get control of the border? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=603.54s)]
*  Before we get to what ended up happening, while you were working on this, were you optimistic [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=607.98s)]
*  that it could succeed? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=615.14s)]
*  I was. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=616.14s)]
*  I was. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=617.14s)]
*  I needed to. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=618.22s)]
*  And the comments that all three of us made was we have to keep working even when it got [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=619.22s)]
*  really hard and we wanted to walk away from the table. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=622.6999999999999s)]
*  We didn't walk away from the table, even when we looked like we were in an impasse, because [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=625.26s)]
*  we had to get something done. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=629.98s)]
*  And all signs indicated that your optimism was actually founded and that the bill was [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=632.54s)]
*  going to pass until Trump came out forcefully against it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=640.02s)]
*  I mean, he was basically whipping against it from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=643.62s)]
*  Did he call you personally? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=647.54s)]
*  And if so, what did he say? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=648.54s)]
*  We did not talk during that time period, actually. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  On my part, that was intentional, quite frankly, because of that exact question. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=652.74s)]
*  I didn't want this to be perceived as a this is President Trump actually trying to be able [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=657.06s)]
*  to run this bill. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=661.24s)]
*  That would be toxic to my Democrat colleagues. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=662.74s)]
*  And this need to be something that we do as a party to be able to resolve right now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=665.66s)]
*  I honestly believe that exact bill would have passed in December. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  By the time it got into February and we were in the heart of the presidential primary election, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=675.34s)]
*  it became immediately the major focus in the election because the Republican primary suddenly [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=681.02s)]
*  got resolved. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=687.1s)]
*  It looked very obvious that President Trump was going to be there and everything collapsed [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=688.74s)]
*  at that point. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=692.14s)]
*  If that bill would have gone in December, I think it would have passed. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=693.26s)]
*  I mean, you've said before that a right-wing commentator threatened you over this bill. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=696.9399999999999s)]
*  Your host, Jesse Kelly, took credit. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=702.58s)]
*  Was it him? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=705.1s)]
*  I would only say when he took credit for that, my first response was, who is that? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=706.9000000000001s)]
*  So no, it wasn't. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=711.82s)]
*  I would only say, I've never identified who it is and I won't. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=714.22s)]
*  But I did have several folks, one just more blunt than others, saying, I'll destroy you [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=719.14s)]
*  if you do this because though I like you, I like President Trump better and he's got [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  to be elected for the future of the country and you can't take this issue off the table. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=728.4200000000001s)]
*  My response was, he has a job that's running for office right now, but I'm in office. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=733.4200000000001s)]
*  I've got to do my job. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=738.22s)]
*  My job is national security. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=739.62s)]
*  I serve on the Intelligence Committee. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=741.62s)]
*  I serve on Homeland Security. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=743.46s)]
*  I have access to a lot of classified information. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=744.6600000000001s)]
*  Starting the last year, we saw the shift that happened on who was crossing the border. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=747.74s)]
*  There was more and more people from outside the Western Hemisphere. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=751.82s)]
*  It was a very different group that was coming across and it was criminal organizations that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=755.3s)]
*  were becoming travel agents to be able to move people and then they were moving people [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=760.1s)]
*  that wanted to be able to work here and then facilitating people that were within their [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=764.46s)]
*  organization. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=768.86s)]
*  That's why we had a couple of months ago, eight folks that were picked up in the United [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=770.26s)]
*  States that were ISIS affiliated, they were moving through those networks that I was aware [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=773.54s)]
*  of before and what was one of the many reasons I was so passionate to say, we can't ignore [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=778.38s)]
*  this moment. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=784.1s)]
*  We see the national security threats that we're facing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=785.7s)]
*  We cannot allow people into our country through these illegal networks that can come in and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=788.5s)]
*  request asylum that we can't tell the difference at the border between those who mean to do [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=794.4200000000001s)]
*  us harm and those who are coming to reconnect with family. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=799.14s)]
*  We cannot tell the difference. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=802.3000000000001s)]
*  The frustration that I have is that it's become more of a political issue than a national [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=804.38s)]
*  security issue when it is really a national security issue. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=808.7s)]
*  When did you get a sense that this was not going to happen? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=812.34s)]
*  There were always people that are opposed to it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=815.9s)]
*  We knew from the beginning, this is hard. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=817.74s)]
*  There's a reason this hasn't been done in decades. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=819.34s)]
*  There were political commentators on television that came out immediately and online saying [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=822.02s)]
*  that we can't solve the border issue right now. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=826.5400000000001s)]
*  This is the single biggest issue. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=829.94s)]
*  We don't want President Trump to lose that issue or they would say, President Biden created [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=831.1800000000001s)]
*  this chaos. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=836.9200000000001s)]
*  We don't want to give him the appearance right before the election that he then solved the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  crisis that he created. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=841.74s)]
*  I would tell you, not just as a conservative, as an American, this is a crisis that the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  administration did botch. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=849.46s)]
*  For President Biden and Vice President Harris, who talked a lot about immigration in the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=851.86s)]
*  earliest days, I said to their team over and over and over again, if you would enforce [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=855.7s)]
*  the border the same way President Obama did, I know you don't want to do it the same way [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=860.1800000000001s)]
*  President Trump did, but if you do it the same way President Obama did, we would not [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=863.86s)]
*  have this problem that we have today. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=868.1800000000001s)]
*  After President Obama, we had half a million people illegally crossing a year. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=870.62s)]
*  Now we have two and a half million people illegally crossing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=874.58s)]
*  So I would bring all those things up to be able to talk about it on both sides, understand [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=877.42s)]
*  it's going to be hard, but then just the noise continued to build. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=880.78s)]
*  And we reached a fever there in that first week of February. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=885.74s)]
*  I think within the last 48 hours, I really realized this is not going to work. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=888.86s)]
*  This is not going to happen. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  Indeed, you were unable to persuade your party. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=896.1s)]
*  And what happened next is truly crazy. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  Can you tell me what it was like to vote against your own bill that you'd worked so hard on? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=903.12s)]
*  I voted for my bill when it came to the floor and as an actual vote. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=907.18s)]
*  Now two months later, Senator Schumer brought it back up as a political exercise to try [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=911.38s)]
*  to poke Republicans in the eye. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=915.42s)]
*  And I said, no, this was never designed to be a political exercise of what I'm doing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=916.98s)]
*  And so at that point, I vote against it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=921.22s)]
*  Kyrsten Sinema voted against it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=923.6999999999999s)]
*  But when it was an actual live round, I was eager to come to the floor and say, it's not [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=925.74s)]
*  everything I would want, but it's also not nothing. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=930.94s)]
*  It does make progress. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=934.3s)]
*  We should make progress in areas where we can make progress and then come back and do [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=935.74s)]
*  more. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=939.14s)]
*  I mean, you've talked about this as a national security issue, but I am curious about how [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=940.14s)]
*  the work on immigration connects to your faith, because there is this philosophy in the evangelical [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=946.26s)]
*  world and it's based in scripture around the idea of welcoming the stranger. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=951.78s)]
*  And the National Association of Evangelicals did support your bill. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=957.3s)]
*  I'm curious if you think that there is some daylight between the MAGA wing of the party [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=962.1s)]
*  and evangelical groups on this issue. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=968.22s)]
*  Yes, there is actually. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=971.18s)]
*  I think there's just an energy that people have to say, I want people to still be welcome [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=974.3s)]
*  in America. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=978.86s)]
*  There are people that are asylees that are fleeing from injustice around the world. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=980.26s)]
*  We don't want to ever lose an America that we're not a place for that. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=984.14s)]
*  But we also know that right now we have two and a half million people a year that are [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=987.5400000000001s)]
*  legally crossing. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=991.26s)]
*  We also don't want that because when you create that kind of chaos, that's not just a faith [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=992.26s)]
*  issue to say we're going to welcome the stranger. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=997.9s)]
*  That's also welcoming folks that are, again, not just pursuing a job and pursuing family, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1000.02s)]
*  which is the vast majority of people that are coming, but it's also welcoming in people [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1004.82s)]
*  that are coming right now that are from Venezuelan gangs that are crossing in, requesting asylum. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1008.86s)]
*  And then they're deliberately targeting Venezuelans that are here in America right now and then [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1013.94s)]
*  abusing them the same way they did back in Venezuela. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1019.82s)]
*  That's also occurring right now. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1022.66s)]
*  And we do have human trafficking and we can all say, well, that's not the majority, but [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1024.76s)]
*  there is human trafficking. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1029.02s)]
*  There is violence. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1030.02s)]
*  There is sex trafficking. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1031.02s)]
*  All these things are also occurring as well. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1032.18s)]
*  And it occurs because we have too many people to manage on a day-to-day basis of the border. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1035.14s)]
*  I mean, speaking of the range of opinion in the GOP on this issue, there were signs at [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1039.5400000000002s)]
*  the RNC saying mass deportation now. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1045.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, that is one of the tenets of the Trump platform. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1048.5800000000002s)]
*  Is that a position that you think is the right one? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1055.18s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, I think there will be mass deportations at some point. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1060.26s)]
*  People define that differently and they hear that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1065.3s)]
*  Some people hear that as a Latina grandmother that's been here 30 years and they're going [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1067.54s)]
*  to say, is she also the target? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1072.22s)]
*  I think the first target that ends up coming are the folks that literally a court, and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1074.26s)]
*  we have millions of people now, that a court has ruled on a final order removal and no [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1078.54s)]
*  one's actually removing them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1084.06s)]
*  I think that's where a lot of Americans are really frustrated to say, hold on, now we [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1086.22s)]
*  have people that are crossing illegally, that are going through the process, they're requesting [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1090.74s)]
*  asylum that they know they don't qualify for, they finally get to the end of it and they [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1095.8600000000001s)]
*  find out, no, you don't qualify. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1099.1000000000001s)]
*  But, Senator Langford, you know that a lot of people understand mass deportations as [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1100.54s)]
*  the rounding up of perhaps a Latina grandmother that's been here for a long time, communities [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1107.38s)]
*  that have settled and have been here for many, many years. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1113.54s)]
*  And many supporters of your party do want there to be just a complete uprooting of people [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1117.98s)]
*  who are undocumented. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1125.5s)]
*  Yeah, I actually don't see a future Trump administration just rounding up all 12 million, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1127.06s)]
*  15 million, whatever number that is, and removing the entire number. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1134.02s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1138.7s)]
*  I see them targeting the folks that have gone through the court proceedings, that have been [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1139.74s)]
*  ruled that they're not legally present, have a criminal record. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1144.5800000000002s)]
*  We have a high number of those folks. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1147.5s)]
*  For the folks that are going through the process, they legally cannot remove them. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1149.5800000000002s)]
*  A court would stop that immediately. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1154.42s)]
*  They know that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1156.06s)]
*  They've been through this for four years before. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1157.06s)]
*  They've seen how the court responds to it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1158.5800000000002s)]
*  But there are folks that a court has said, yes, you should be gone. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1160.9s)]
*  And again, that's millions of people. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1164.26s)]
*  That's a different issue for me. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1166.98s)]
*  But the courts and the law is not going to allow someone to say they're just being taken [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1169.3s)]
*  out of the country. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1173.22s)]
*  There's been discussion of large camps that these people will be put in, and just raising [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1174.22s)]
*  the specter of things that, quite frankly, to many in immigrant communities are frightening. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1178.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1184.34s)]
*  We're back to the social media world, and the things that get promoted, and the things [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1185.34s)]
*  that get said there. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1190.02s)]
*  The large camp, I don't know what that would look like, other than a gathering spot that's [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1191.54s)]
*  very similar to what happens at the border right now, when people illegally cross. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1196.58s)]
*  Even under this administration now, just in the last few months, they've started actually [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1200.62s)]
*  putting up locations to say, we're going to detain you, and to try to have all the hearings, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1204.34s)]
*  and to have your first appeals and evaluation at the border, rather than just released into [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1208.98s)]
*  the country. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1213.42s)]
*  That's the nature of actually trying to be able to manage that number of people. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1215.06s)]
*  When you've got thousands of people that you're trying to manage, you do have to find opportunities [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1218.58s)]
*  and places to be able to do that. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1223.3s)]
*  I say all those things to say, when you talk about mass deportations, all things have to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1225.58s)]
*  be done sound with the law, and consistent with the law. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1229.54s)]
*  That's why I don't believe there's going to be just a mass roundup of 15 million people [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1232.82s)]
*  put into a camp, and then shipped out, because that wouldn't be consistent with the way we [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1236.82s)]
*  handle it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1240.62s)]
*  I have a bigger question, which is about the actual appetite for legislating. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1243.34s)]
*  In your speech when introducing the doomed bill, you noted that many of your colleagues [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1249.1s)]
*  hadn't read it, and didn't want to read it, because it was long, and it was technical. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1254.12s)]
*  I'm just wondering what your takeaway was from your colleagues not wanting to legislate. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1259.96s)]
*  What does it say to you that politics won out over policy here? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1267.1999999999998s)]
*  Politics won out over policy, no doubt on that. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  I had colleagues that said, hey, this is very technical, and I'm going to need a week to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  be able to read this and review it before I can vote on it. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  I said, I totally understand that, and we'll give you the time to do that. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1283.52s)]
*  But within 30 minutes of the bill being released, they were putting out statements saying I'm [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1287.32s)]
*  opposed to it, it's terrible. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1291.4s)]
*  A couple things I would say on that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1293.48s)]
*  One is we needed more cooks in the kitchen. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1295.3s)]
*  The process of actually everybody picking a champion on each of the party areas and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1298.12s)]
*  put them all together to resolve it for something this complicated and for something this controversial, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1302.04s)]
*  we needed more people that were actually engaged, that were invested in early on. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1307.36s)]
*  I tried to keep my conference as informed as I could without it all leaking out to [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1311.72s)]
*  the media where we were because for Chris Murphy and Kirsten Sinema and I, we were very [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1315.8000000000002s)]
*  committed to protecting each other in this process and protecting the negotiation to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1319.88s)]
*  be able to move forward, which we did. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1324.64s)]
*  But we needed more people that were personally invested, and I think that was a mistake of [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1327.5200000000002s)]
*  the negotiation. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1331.5200000000002s)]
*  It would be great if our committees worked and actually pushed out a lot of very hard [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1332.5200000000002s)]
*  things like this, but they've not been successful of late of actually getting negotiations and [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1338.64s)]
*  getting commitment on that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1343.28s)]
*  I hope that we can get back to that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1344.28s)]
*  We do have some big bills like the FAA bill that got to a resolution that they agreed [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  on unanimously, moved it, came to the floor, passed it as law now. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1350.44s)]
*  So it can be done. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1354.18s)]
*  I guess the question is though, can it be done when Trump doesn't want it to be done? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1355.92s)]
*  Everybody's got to come on board on this. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1363.3600000000001s)]
*  We've got a House, Senate and White House all come to agreement on that. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1364.78s)]
*  And obviously, during this time period on this particular issue, we didn't get it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1367.94s)]
*  There's a stack of issues that are harder than others. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1373.46s)]
*  But Senator Lankford, what I'm asking is, how much independence does your body of legislators [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1375.8999999999999s)]
*  have from what Trump does or doesn't want for the party? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1382.58s)]
*  I mean, you are a separate branch of government. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1386.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1389.06s)]
*  Yeah, we are. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1390.06s)]
*  As I joke with people, but it's really true, I have folks that will tell me when President [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1391.34s)]
*  Trump was president, OK, he's the boss. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1395.6599999999999s)]
*  And I would say, no, he's not. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1397.54s)]
*  He's a co-equal branch. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1398.54s)]
*  I don't work for the president. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1400.4199999999998s)]
*  I work for the people of Oklahoma. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1402.12s)]
*  That's who I work for. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1403.8999999999999s)]
*  And I have a different responsibility to be able to take on. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1405.3799999999999s)]
*  I think we do have to protect that constitutional integrity of government and how things are [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1407.58s)]
*  set up. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1411.78s)]
*  President Trump obviously has influence because there are millions and millions of Americans [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  that also believe in him, many from my state as well, that would say, that's the opinion [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1416.86s)]
*  that I have. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1422.4199999999998s)]
*  That's the expression that I have. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1423.4199999999998s)]
*  And so it's not just that President Trump thinks it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1424.6599999999999s)]
*  It's that there are millions of Americans that also think that as well. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1427.1s)]
*  And they want to get things resolved. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1429.9399999999998s)]
*  What is your relationship with former President Trump now, briefly? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1432.06s)]
*  Actually good still. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1435.78s)]
*  I mean, I reached out to him after the assassination attempt and said, hey, Cindy and I are praying [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1436.78s)]
*  for you. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1442.78s)]
*  Had a very good response in the statement that he made the very next day on it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1444.5s)]
*  He was obviously protected by God for a reason. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1448.3400000000001s)]
*  He needs to live that out. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1450.74s)]
*  I said, I personally believe that. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1452.0600000000002s)]
*  That was a semi-miraculous event in a million ways of things that could have gone even worse [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1454.8200000000002s)]
*  than they were. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1459.98s)]
*  And so reached out. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1461.38s)]
*  He reached right back. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1462.74s)]
*  The debate will say thank you. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1463.74s)]
*  So we continue to stay engaged in ways where we agree, where we agree, where we disagree, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1465.5s)]
*  we disagree. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1471.18s)]
*  Even in a statement that he made at lunch about a month and a half ago now when he met [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1472.66s)]
*  with the Republican senators, even in that statement, he said, let's find areas where [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1477.46s)]
*  we can agree. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1481.7s)]
*  Let's work on those and areas where we don't agree. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1482.7s)]
*  Let's keep talking about it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  That's a different attitude than I think a lot of people have about President Trump, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1487.3400000000001s)]
*  that they don't see that part of him. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1490.98s)]
*  But he is still ultimately a negotiator. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1493.18s)]
*  And he feels like he has greatest negotiating power when he states a really strong opinion [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1495.18s)]
*  upfront and say, this is what we have to do and kind of punch in the face and then [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1499.62s)]
*  to say this is what we're going to do, but then come back and to be able to negotiate [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1504.3s)]
*  the rest. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1507.86s)]
*  That is really how he functions on a daily basis. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1508.86s)]
*  Sometimes that works and sometimes it does not. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1511.1s)]
*  Do you consider yourself MAGA? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1513.8999999999999s)]
*  Am I passionate about making America great? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1516.6599999999999s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1518.6999999999998s)]
*  And so people try to identify and try to project whatever they want to project on people that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1520.54s)]
*  say you're passionate about making America great again. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1525.9399999999998s)]
*  If you want to project everything that is President Trump on me, no, we address things [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1529.3799999999999s)]
*  differently. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1534.5s)]
*  If I can tell you one funny story on this. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1535.5s)]
*  Please. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1536.8999999999999s)]
*  I went to the Army-Navy game with President Trump one year and he invited me to be able [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1537.8999999999999s)]
*  to travel on Air Force One and we were flying over to the game and we're sitting right next [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1543.4199999999998s)]
*  to each other on the plane and just chatting. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1547.6599999999999s)]
*  And at one point he's working on a tweet. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1549.3799999999999s)]
*  Back in the old days when we used to call them tweets, he leans over me and goes, you [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1551.74s)]
*  wouldn't tweet this. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1554.98s)]
*  I laughed and I said, well, you probably shouldn't either. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1556.78s)]
*  And he laughed. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1559.6200000000001s)]
*  He said, I'm going to because I think it's funny. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1560.6200000000001s)]
*  And then he finished it and he showed it to me and I said, you're right, sir. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1563.06s)]
*  I wouldn't have tweeted that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1565.9s)]
*  He and I can agree on some policy areas and some policy areas we disagree. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1568.54s)]
*  We have different methods. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1571.82s)]
*  We have different perspectives. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1572.82s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1575.34s)]
*  I try to stay who I am. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1576.34s)]
*  He solves problems in a different way than I do. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1578.14s)]
*  We'll see which one works and they'll work for different issues in different ways. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1580.78s)]
*  I don't have the same swagger and attitude, but I do have a very conservative perspective [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1584.46s)]
*  and I'm going to try to persuade. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1588.98s)]
*  I've never had anyone ever persuade me of something by yelling at me and cussing me out. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1590.22s)]
*  Your former colleague, Senator JD Vance, is now the Republican VP. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1596.5800000000002s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts on him and his very brief record in the Senate? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1600.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually my challenge is that he's been there 18 months. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1603.6200000000001s)]
*  We really haven't got to know each other very well. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1606.42s)]
*  We don't serve on any committees together. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1608.42s)]
*  We've not traveled together on anything else. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1610.7800000000002s)]
*  And so I've really haven't had much of an opportunity to be able to get to know him [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1612.22s)]
*  personally and to be able to know perspectives on this. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1615.18s)]
*  Obviously, we've had dialogues in a public setting in our lunchtimes, which are supposedly [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1618.18s)]
*  private that seem to get leaked out to the media every single lunch. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1623.22s)]
*  But we've had some dialogues around there, but very little contact with him. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1627.58s)]
*  This is my last question for now. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1632.8600000000001s)]
*  As we're talking, I've been thinking a lot about Mike Pence because he was someone who [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1635.9s)]
*  was deeply conservative, deeply religious, and also deeply loyal to Trump until he took [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1643.1000000000001s)]
*  what he felt was a principled stand at the end. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1649.02s)]
*  And looking at the immigration bill and how quickly the party moved against you, do you [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1653.02s)]
*  think it's possible to stick with your principles in this GOP? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1660.46s)]
*  Sure, I do. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1665.18s)]
*  You live your principles out. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1667.1000000000001s)]
*  And the days you lose a vote or an issue that you feel is important, you back up and you [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1670.0600000000002s)]
*  keep going at it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1675.7s)]
*  In politics, most things don't happen the first time you try. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1677.7s)]
*  Things that pass often have been ruminating for years to be able to actually get to passage [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1682.5800000000002s)]
*  on it. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1687.78s)]
*  Immigration has been an issue that multiple Republicans over the past 35 years could say [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1688.78s)]
*  tried it and it failed, tried it and it failed. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1694.34s)]
*  But it's still an unresolved issue. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1697.02s)]
*  So we're going to have to get to a point that we can actually get this resolved and get [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1699.06s)]
*  it done. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1702.1399999999999s)]
*  But yes, if you sacrifice your basic principles and your values, you've given away what you [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  actually brought to Washington, D.C., and that's the perspective of your state and your [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1709.3s)]
*  family. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1713.82s)]
*  So I'm not going to sacrifice those. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1715.3s)]
*  So again, this is going to sound from my ministry background on this. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1717.06s)]
*  Nehemiah chapter one does a great story about Hanani, who's the brother of Nehemiah coming [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1723.66s)]
*  back from Jerusalem when they're both living as slaves in isolation and exile. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1729.74s)]
*  And Nehemiah catches his brother Hanani and said, what's it like in Jerusalem now? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1734.9s)]
*  And Hanani says, oh, it's awful. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1739.22s)]
*  The people live in disgrace. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1740.98s)]
*  The walls are down. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1742.22s)]
*  The economy's collapsed. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1743.22s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1745.06s)]
*  And Hanani walks off. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1746.06s)]
*  And Nehemiah, who wasn't even there or didn't even see it, prays, it says, for some days [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1747.78s)]
*  and basically prays, God, this is terrible. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1753.1000000000001s)]
*  What do I do about it? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1755.6200000000001s)]
*  There's two different perspectives that come out of that. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1757.54s)]
*  There's a Hanani that sees the problem and says stinks to be them and walks away. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1759.74s)]
*  And there's a Nehemiah that says, that's terrible. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1765.42s)]
*  God, what can I do to make that better? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1768.42s)]
*  I have to make a decision every single day. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1771.3400000000001s)]
*  Am I going to be Hanani or am I going to be a Nehemiah? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1773.66s)]
*  I'm choosing to be a Nehemiah to say, God, what is it that you call me to do? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1776.5s)]
*  How can I help the nation and other people? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1780.54s)]
*  What needs to be done and how can it be done? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1783.46s)]
*  God, I need your favor to be able to get this done. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1785.14s)]
*  Pray, go to work. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1787.7s)]
*  Senator Lankford, thank you so much. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1794.02s)]
*  And we will talk again. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1796.1s)]
*  I look forward to it, actually. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1797.1s)]
*  After the break, I call Senator Lankford back to talk some more about his faith, how he [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1801.58s)]
*  thinks it should affect his politics and how it shouldn't. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1806.26s)]
*  I am not a Christian nationalist. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1810.86s)]
*  I'm a person who's very passionate about our First Amendment rights. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1813.5s)]
*  We all have the right to have any faith of our choosing, to be able to change our faith [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1816.5s)]
*  or to be able to have no faith. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1820.5s)]
*  That is a protected right that we've had from the beginning. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1821.9s)]
*  Senator Lankford, hello. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1836.66s)]
*  How are you today? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1838.9s)]
*  I'm pretty good. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1840.3799999999999s)]
*  Senator, I've really enjoyed hearing about your thinking on issues in the GOP. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1843.9s)]
*  And listening to you talk, it is very clear that this all springs from the context of [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1851.14s)]
*  your faith. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1858.34s)]
*  It brings me to this sort of question more broadly about how you think about your role [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1859.58s)]
*  as a representative for Oklahomans who don't share your faith. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1864.54s)]
*  If your belief infuses your politics, but your constituents might be atheists or Muslims [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1869.3799999999999s)]
*  or other non-Christians, is there an argument to be made that there should be limits on [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1873.94s)]
*  how much one's religion should shape legislation? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1879.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you would do that, actually. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1885.78s)]
*  I'm just trying to think pragmatically how you would say, I need you to separate your [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1888.8999999999999s)]
*  faith from your beliefs. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1893.1s)]
*  Your faith affects everything. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1894.54s)]
*  If your faith only affects, like where I attend church on a Sunday, but only affects what [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1895.78s)]
*  I do on the weekend, that's not really a faith, that's a hobby. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1900.5s)]
*  My faith is the lens that I look through. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1903.5s)]
*  And when people elect me, they understand full well this is one of the lenses that I [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1905.82s)]
*  look through. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1910.42s)]
*  Now, saying that, I also have the responsibility to respect other people in my state and their [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1911.42s)]
*  worldview. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1916.5s)]
*  I'm not trying to impose mine on them. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1917.5s)]
*  So I think to me, the biggest issue is the balance and the respect that other individuals [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1919.54s)]
*  can have a respect for my faith and what I believe. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1923.86s)]
*  I need to reciprocate that and have a respect for their faith and for what they believe. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1927.06s)]
*  But then again, as I'm making decisions for legislation, I do have a lens that I look [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1931.5s)]
*  through and everyone's fully aware of what that is before I was ever elected. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1936.6599999999999s)]
*  Something else that is being debated hotly at this moment is the separation of church [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1941.46s)]
*  and state, which is this foundational principle of our country. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1947.02s)]
*  You've had Senator Josh Hawley, your colleague, among others on the right, explicitly embrace [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1951.1799999999998s)]
*  Christian nationalism. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1956.4599999999998s)]
*  And so I'm wondering where you stand on that issue. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1957.4599999999998s)]
*  I am not a Christian nationalist. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1961.74s)]
*  I'm a person who's very passionate about our First Amendment rights. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1964.3799999999999s)]
*  We all have the right to have any faith of our choosing, to be able to change our faith [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  or to be able to have no faith. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1971.3799999999999s)]
*  That is a protected right that we've had from the beginning, where you have voluntary [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1972.78s)]
*  faith and you're allowed to be able to choose. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1976.82s)]
*  You're more passionate about it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1979.34s)]
*  So to me, trying to be able to impose faith on someone not only doesn't work, as you can [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1981.1s)]
*  see in multiple different nations where that doesn't work, it often leads to oppression. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1986.26s)]
*  And I can look at the Iranian regime and how they take their faith and try to impose it [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1991.38s)]
*  on their people in that way and see what that actually leads to. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=1996.14s)]
*  Or I look at a place that actually has a vibrant faith where people have the opportunity to [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2000.42s)]
*  be able to choose and live that out. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2003.94s)]
*  Well, that's interesting, the distinction there about voluntary participation. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2006.1399999999999s)]
*  So how do you feel about the Oklahoma mandate to teach the Bible in public schools or Louisiana [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2010.6599999999999s)]
*  requiring schools to display the Ten Commandments? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2015.22s)]
*  That goes back to Bible as literature. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2020.5s)]
*  You're not going to understand Western culture without understanding something about Scripture. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2022.8999999999999s)]
*  I was raised in a setting where in literature class, we read some of the Psalms. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2027.54s)]
*  You'll hear terms in culture where they talk about a tale of two cities. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2032.82s)]
*  You should know what a tale of two cities is. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2036.06s)]
*  Based on a basic idea of that, you also hear people talking about somebody went Old Testament [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2038.42s)]
*  on somebody. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2042.54s)]
*  But that's different than imposing a faith on someone. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2043.54s)]
*  If I'm imposing a faith on them to say, this is the faith that the leader of the governor [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2046.78s)]
*  of the state has or the president of the United States has, and so everyone has to have that, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2051.14s)]
*  that's very different than what it is to say that this is literature. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2056.06s)]
*  Now, I say that as a Christ follower personally for me. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2060.1s)]
*  I read Scripture every day. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2063.5s)]
*  I find great value in understanding Scripture. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2064.98s)]
*  And quite frankly, I would be ecstatic if the people around me came to know God the [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2067.86s)]
*  same way I am because I found such great joy and forgiveness in my own faith and relationship. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2071.9s)]
*  So I speak openly about that, but that's a personal issue for me. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2077.38s)]
*  That's not a governmental issue for me. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2081.14s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting because like, in theory, I see your point perhaps on teaching [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2083.06s)]
*  the Bible in public schools. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2088.16s)]
*  It is, you know, a seminal work that infuses, as you say, much of literature and culture [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2089.5s)]
*  and discourse. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2098.86s)]
*  But isn't it government overreach to have Louisiana requiring schools to display the [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2100.46s)]
*  Ten Commandments? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2105.02s)]
*  I mean, that's a different type of thing, isn't it? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2106.02s)]
*  It is a different type of thing in the sense that it is a particular faith and a particular [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2109.42s)]
*  foundational teaching. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2114.26s)]
*  Obviously, putting up on a board that you shouldn't murder, you shouldn't steal, you [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2115.94s)]
*  know, that's not a negative thing. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2121.34s)]
*  You shouldn't covet someone else's wife. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2122.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2123.74s)]
*  Yes, right. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2124.74s)]
*  Not commit adultery. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2125.74s)]
*  To 10-year-olds? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2126.74s)]
*  These are things that are out there. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2127.74s)]
*  But again, it is a religious practice. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2130.58s)]
*  It is something that, again, that is common. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2132.66s)]
*  I'll let the courts make all the decisions on this, but for me, that doesn't offend me [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2134.74s)]
*  for that to be able to be there. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2138.2999999999997s)]
*  And that is something that we as a culture and the individual states should have the [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2140.22s)]
*  right to be able to speak out on. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2143.58s)]
*  We ended our last conversation with a question about dissent in the Republican Party and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2145.98s)]
*  whether or not there could be. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2152.22s)]
*  And we talked about that in the context of the immigration debate. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2154.38s)]
*  But I am wondering what you think about Trump's views on abortion. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2157.2599999999998s)]
*  You are to the right of him on this issue. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2162.18s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that I found very interesting reading the platform put forward [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2164.94s)]
*  the convention on abortion in particular is that it kind of felt like it was trying to [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2170.9s)]
*  do two things at once. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2176.02s)]
*  It was saying it should be left up to the states, which is publicly what Trump has said. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2178.06s)]
*  But it also invoked the 14th Amendment, which basically says that if people interpret it [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2182.34s)]
*  in the way that some on the right would like it interpreted, that basically makes abortion [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2188.38s)]
*  illegal because it protects the unborn child. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2193.34s)]
*  And so I'm just wondering how you think about that duality, those two tracks. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2196.9s)]
*  I was not in the platform committee debate, but you are correct. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2202.78s)]
*  There's been a longstanding part of the Republican platform that recognizes that child is a child [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2206.26s)]
*  that's a person that's here. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2212.34s)]
*  We can determine what's going to do if there's significant birth defects, if it's rape or [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2213.86s)]
*  incest, if there is all these different challenges to the health and life of the mother. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2218.62s)]
*  That's been separate. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2224.9s)]
*  But barring all of those things, there's been this dialogue that's been among Republicans [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2226.62s)]
*  for a long time to say, hey, we think that's a baby that's in there. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2230.78s)]
*  And so what are we going to do about that? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2234.54s)]
*  So the conversation has been at what point do we recognize that person and then what [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2236.94s)]
*  happens as a result of that? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2240.78s)]
*  I think what President Trump has been is we don't have the votes for this. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2243.1s)]
*  There's no way it's going to move in the next four years, maybe the next 40 years, while [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2246.46s)]
*  our nation continues to be able to debate this. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2251.06s)]
*  And so his push is states that want to make this decision can make these decisions on [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2253.62s)]
*  it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2258.02s)]
*  Federally, we're not at a place where this decision is going to be made. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2259.02s)]
*  And so let's not make this a massive issue when it's not going to happen right now. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2262.42s)]
*  Let's actually work on the things that we can work on. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2268.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting because you've always talked about principles and how important [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2270.2999999999997s)]
*  that is for you. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2275.46s)]
*  Do you think that that's the right choice for him to be pragmatic about it? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2276.46s)]
*  He is being pragmatic on it. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2281.98s)]
*  I'm a person that's going to continue to be able to speak out and say, yes, yes, but we [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2284.18s)]
*  don't have the votes for it right now. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2288.02s)]
*  But I also believe that's a child. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2289.9s)]
*  And so let's at least talk about this. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2291.46s)]
*  There's a difference between a legal issue and a hard issue. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2293.6s)]
*  In Oklahoma right now, there are plenty of ladies that have an abortion that leave the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2297.22s)]
*  state to go have an elective abortion in Colorado, for instance. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2301.42s)]
*  So that's a decision that they have made. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2305.62s)]
*  So for me, it's I'm not flipping about this. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2307.52s)]
*  Some people are flipping about those difficult situations. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2309.86s)]
*  I'm not in those very difficult moments that where she's making decisions to determine [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2313.26s)]
*  do we have enough adoption facilities? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2318.86s)]
*  Do we have enough provision? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2320.42s)]
*  Do we are we taking care of all the things that can be so that she does not have to live [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2321.7000000000003s)]
*  in fear of those areas of what happens next while she's also having to make a decision [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2325.26s)]
*  about the future of her child? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2331.38s)]
*  You know, I want to end by asking you about this election season because evangelicals [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2336.46s)]
*  and white evangelicals in particular are a huge part of Trump's base. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2344.06s)]
*  I saw a statistic that a third of his votes came from white evangelical Protestants, which [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2347.58s)]
*  is just a huge number. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2352.58s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons that I was curious to talk to you because you are part of that [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2355.78s)]
*  community, you are a leader in that community. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2359.02s)]
*  And I'm thinking back to your early days as a pastor shaping the minds and hearts of young [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2361.86s)]
*  people. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2367.06s)]
*  And I do wonder if you think Donald Trump is a good role model for them. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2368.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a fair question because I've actually made that public statement before on this. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2374.06s)]
*  My preference is to be able to have leaders that are also role models. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2379.06s)]
*  I don't believe he's a role model in every area. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2381.94s)]
*  But when evangelicals make decisions on voting, they'll often look at things like religious [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2384.9s)]
*  liberty or the pro-life positions to be able to talk about the protection of children. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2390.3s)]
*  So evangelicals look for where can I land in a place that is closest to what I believe [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2396.3s)]
*  on some very core issues on that. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2402.1000000000004s)]
*  And they make their decisions from their own voting. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  What would you make of the way that he addresses your community? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2406.42s)]
*  Because you know, he made some comments recently where he said, Christians, you won't have [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2412.7400000000002s)]
*  to vote again. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2417.9s)]
*  We'll have it fixed so good. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2418.9s)]
*  You're not going to have to vote. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2419.9s)]
*  And I have no idea what that means. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2420.9s)]
*  Clearly we're going to have another election four years from now. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2426.9s)]
*  In fact, I've already had a conversation with folks to say, you know, as we're thinking [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2428.7400000000002s)]
*  about where we're headed for now for the past 12 years, there's been this conversation about [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2432.2200000000003s)]
*  President Trump before that candidate Trump and President Trump and then the election [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2436.9s)]
*  and the next election. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2441.14s)]
*  That's not going to be so four years from now. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2442.14s)]
*  So we as a party have to think about what we're going to like and what our focus is [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2444.6s)]
*  going to be and what direction things are going to go. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2448.62s)]
*  Those are pragmatic conversations, but we're certainly going to have elections. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2452.2599999999998s)]
*  Nothing's going to break the Constitution. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2456.42s)]
*  We've had almost 250 years now of normal, consistent elections because it's a core part [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2458.06s)]
*  of who we are as a republic. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2464.58s)]
*  And in those conversations where you're looking four years from now, if indeed former President [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2466.86s)]
*  Trump wins the election to a post Trump era, what are you telling your community about [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2472.5s)]
*  what that will mean? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2479.06s)]
*  I'm just getting people thinking about that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2482.06s)]
*  Who are we going to be and what will be the things that will be most valuable to us? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2484.1s)]
*  How are we going to resolve debt and deficit? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2488.7s)]
*  How are we going to be able to balance the economy? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2490.22s)]
*  If we mess this up, it doesn't just mess us up. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2491.9s)]
*  It takes the entire world down. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2494.86s)]
*  The threat from China is very different than we faced from the Soviet Union back in the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2496.98s)]
*  1960s, 70s, and 80s. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2501.54s)]
*  So we've got to be able to figure out what does national security look like? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2503.78s)]
*  And then all the social issues were very different than what we were in the 1980s. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2506.18s)]
*  But when you have hard problems, you have to find a way to be able to solve hard problems. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2510.62s)]
*  And that's usually not by ignoring them or saying that they will fix themselves. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2514.18s)]
*  I go back to our earlier conversation on the issue of immigration. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2518.3s)]
*  This doesn't just magically get better. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2522.26s)]
*  That involves sitting down, having dialogue, setting principles down, saying, all right, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2525.42s)]
*  let's actually work through this to be able to make a decision, because when that hard [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2529.2599999999998s)]
*  decision is done, there's another hard decision coming right after it. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2532.74s)]
*  That's Senator James Langford. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Yjh1e15w&t=2542.2599999999998s)]
