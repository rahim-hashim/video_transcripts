# Mia Khalifa’s Messy World of Money, Sex and Activism
**New York Times - The Interview:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU)
*  Do they sell these mugs downstairs? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know, but I bet if you really want one, we could get you one. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=3.34s)]
*  Will you sign it? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=6.76s)]
*  I could. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=7.76s)]
*  I think that would probably detract from the value of the mug. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=8.76s)]
*  To start, I've seen you online or in other interviews talk about the idea that you're [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=19.06s)]
*  kind of in the middle of a rebranding. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=25.42s)]
*  But the thing that I haven't seen you talk about is what you think your brand was and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=29.34s)]
*  what you want your brand to be now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=35.82s)]
*  So can you sort of fill that story in for me? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=38.9s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  I feel like my brand at the beginning wasn't something that was very much in my control. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  I kind of became infamous by accident. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  I entered the adult industry in October of 2014. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=50.28s)]
*  Very, very quickly, I was pressured to perform in a video where the context was that I was [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  an Arab failed woman. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=65.82s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=68.3s)]
*  The intent was to exploit the fact that I was Arabic and spoke Arabic. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=70.22s)]
*  And I went through with it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=75.7s)]
*  And not very long after, I would say like maybe a couple hours after it premiered, the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=77.02s)]
*  avalanche started. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=84.54s)]
*  Every news outlet picked it up and everybody had an opinion on it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=85.74s)]
*  And it felt like from there on, my fate was sealed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=89.66s)]
*  And all of a sudden, I was completely out of control of my image, my reputation, my [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=93.02s)]
*  intentions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=98.42s)]
*  Every single thing about me was being misunderstood. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=99.86s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people have slutty phases when they're when they're 20, 21, like in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=101.94s)]
*  college. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=107.66s)]
*  And unfortunately, mine, mine was in 4k. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=108.88s)]
*  How did it become clear to you that you couldn't really go back to normal life in the way that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=113.22s)]
*  you wanted? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=119.34s)]
*  I was working at a law office and I started to feel like a distraction in the office. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=120.34s)]
*  Anyone who would come in, there would be whispers in the waiting room. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=126.78s)]
*  And if other attorneys came to visit from other firms, there would be whispers within [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=132.62s)]
*  that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=136.34s)]
*  I feel very much like a distraction and uncomfortable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=137.34s)]
*  And that's when I realized like, this is this isn't going to change. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=143.26s)]
*  This isn't going to go anywhere. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=146.74s)]
*  This isn't going to get better. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=147.86s)]
*  I don't I don't like feeling this way. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=149.86s)]
*  I don't like I don't like, you know, the women that I work with looking at me a certain way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=151.3s)]
*  And I especially don't like the men looking at me a certain way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=156.02s)]
*  Because it's a bit of like a like a zoo animal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=161.06s)]
*  It's that type of fascination and those type of whispers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=164.86s)]
*  Not necessarily to say that it was abusive or disrespectful, but it was just like, that's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=167.34s)]
*  not something that I wanted to keep dealing with. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=172.18s)]
*  And I reopened social media and I decided to actually try to be an influencer and to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=174.62s)]
*  be someone who was who was a public person if that was the fate that I had sealed for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=180.26s)]
*  myself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=184.3s)]
*  So in that sense, when we talk about what your brand was, really, we just mean how people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=185.3s)]
*  knew you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=193.34s)]
*  The brand that they formed in their head because there was no there was no intention, there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=194.5s)]
*  was no purposeful intention behind that brand. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=199.34s)]
*  And I think that where I am now mentally, emotionally, just on every level is a complete [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  180 from who I was. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=211.02s)]
*  I want my brand to represent being a contradiction. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=213.06s)]
*  That's my brand. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=216.06s)]
*  Just evolution. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=217.06s)]
*  I think you have somewhere in the neighborhood of six million followers on X. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=219.1s)]
*  Twenty six million people follow you on Instagram. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=222.98s)]
*  I think I think thirty eight million follow you on TikTok. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=225.54s)]
*  So how do you reinforce your brand on each of those platforms and how is it different [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=229.22s)]
*  on each of those platforms? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=236.06s)]
*  That's such a good question, because you're not going to succeed if you are the same across [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=237.18s)]
*  all platforms. Not to say that you have to be different, but you have to show different [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=240.9s)]
*  sides of you. We're all multifaceted. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=244.46s)]
*  And and TikTok is more for like my skin care and like fun music and and silly videos. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=246.18s)]
*  And then my my Twitter is well, Twitter. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=253.9s)]
*  Twitter is my favorite app in general. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=256.94s)]
*  It's where I get all of my news. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=259.02s)]
*  It's it's very much about activism and jokes and and just what what Twitter was made for. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=260.5s)]
*  So I I'm trying to find that balance of of hoping that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=268.38s)]
*  My my my grand intention gets across on all of them while still being true to what each [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=275.29999999999995s)]
*  platform is is kind of for. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=281.9s)]
*  But my assumption and tell me if I'm wrong, is that, you know, sort of your moneymaker is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  only fans where you're also extremely popular. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've seen in interviews, you know, I think someone once asked you like, do you [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=292.58s)]
*  make ten thousand dollars a day? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=297.22s)]
*  And I don't remember if you said yes, but I think you're like, it's in the neighborhood of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  that. Or I've seen stories that suggested like six million dollars a month. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=301.26000000000005s)]
*  Like, just really is that not? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=304.94000000000005s)]
*  Oh, my God. No, that's insane. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  No, that's like that's like Googling someone's network. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  That's never accurate. Those aren't true. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=310.82000000000005s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you feel like there's any tension or anything to reconcile in the fact that you make your [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  money on this one platform that I assume is predominantly men? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=324.62s)]
*  And it seems like sort of your followers on these other platforms are women. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=331.94s)]
*  And just like content wise, not there are ways in which they're not in alignment with the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=337.06s)]
*  stuff that that's on OnlyFans. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=342.62s)]
*  Does that feel like something that you have to reconcile in some way? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  Or how do you understand that gap? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not necessarily that because I feel like the way that I'm on the platform is a way [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=350.74s)]
*  that is very true to myself and makes me makes me feel comfortable with being on it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=355.3s)]
*  I do not like catering to the male audience, even though it might seem like I do, just [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=360.3s)]
*  because just just because I I look a certain way in a bikini does not necessarily mean [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=366.54s)]
*  it's not for the girls. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=372.9s)]
*  Anyone who goes on my OnlyFans and asks for something crude or something, something past [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=373.9s)]
*  my boundaries, like I don't do I don't do nudity past what I've done in a fashion [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=380.22s)]
*  magazine, which is like a see-through shirt or something like that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=384.22s)]
*  So so I feel very, very secure. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=386.42s)]
*  And the audience that I've cultivated on that platform also knows what they're in for. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=390.06s)]
*  So I I don't have I don't have trouble with that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=395.26000000000005s)]
*  I have more trouble with. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=398.02000000000004s)]
*  With making sure that I'm not I'm not promoting it as as a platform that that is an answer [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=402.3s)]
*  to women who are looking for quick money or or easy money or the life of an influencer [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=408.34s)]
*  that they that they might see me live. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=414.26s)]
*  I feel like I have a responsibility to. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=416.41999999999996s)]
*  To not promote it as something that young women or any woman should join unless they've [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  already been in the sex work industry, unless they're over 25 and their frontal cortex [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=425.7s)]
*  has formed, unless they're coming at it from from a place that is that's not that's not. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=431.54s)]
*  Not I don't want to use the word desperate, but just from from a place of clarity and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=440.74s)]
*  from a place of of good intentions and agency. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=446.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Thank you for that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=449.22s)]
*  From a place of agency and bodily autonomy, not from a place of of, oh, I need to do this [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=451.26s)]
*  because I want to live this lifestyle, because that's not the case. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=457.22s)]
*  I am very much an outlier. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=460.94s)]
*  The reason that I'm able to be so successful on that platform is because I'm extremely [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=462.3s)]
*  fortunate, but I've also paid the price with a lot of misfortune. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=468.14s)]
*  So me going onto that platform felt like a reclamation rather than, oh, I want to I want [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=472.78s)]
*  to do this so that I can live like this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=480.58s)]
*  And maybe it would just be helpful to pull back for a little and give some kind of like [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=482.86s)]
*  broader context about how you got to that reclamation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=488.3s)]
*  So, you know, there was the experience in the adult film industry that you talked about. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=491.82s)]
*  When did the decision come to give only fans a try? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=498.06s)]
*  Initially, I was on a platform called Patreon. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=504.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And it was so much work. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=506.74s)]
*  It was so much production. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=508.86s)]
*  It was it was really, really difficult to keep up because most people who are on Patreon [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  are like doing podcasts and my tiers are like, oh, if you're if you're on this tier, then [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=514.94s)]
*  you know, you get you get you get this photo shoot. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=520.22s)]
*  And if you're on this tier, you get one live stream of me cooking a week. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=522.86s)]
*  And it started to feel like like I wasn't cut out to be a streamer. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=526.7800000000001s)]
*  And that's what it started to feel like. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=530.7800000000001s)]
*  It started to feel like I had to host a podcast or do something to make it worthwhile for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  for Patreon members. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=536.86s)]
*  And then in 2020, I decided to join only fans after the Beirut blast. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=538.7800000000001s)]
*  I made the decision to join only fans and donate. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=544.26s)]
*  If I was able to make one hundred thousand dollars, I am donating one hundred thousand [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=547.62s)]
*  dollars. And that's why I'm joining this platform. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=551.58s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=553.66s)]
*  And after after that, I realized the community there isn't necessarily as as negative as [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  I kind of had written it off to be in my head. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=564.34s)]
*  And I was able to reach that goal. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=566.5s)]
*  And I've been on there ever since. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=568.94s)]
*  And I love it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=570.58s)]
*  You. Have obviously had pretty negative experiences in. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=572.74s)]
*  I guess we call it the sex work industry. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  And I mean, is it fair to categorize only fans as sex work? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=585.26s)]
*  Also, it is. And I feel like people who get insulted by that feel feel ashamed of being [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=589.7s)]
*  lumped in with sex workers. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=595.1s)]
*  But no, that's that's that is the definition. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=597.1s)]
*  The adult industry, the sex work industry. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=599.34s)]
*  So on only fans, your experience in that industry has been much more positive and it's one [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=601.38s)]
*  of agency and sort of you're in control. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=606.22s)]
*  And and. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=609.86s)]
*  You've also spoken out pretty candidly about what you see as the dangers of the sex work [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=612.5400000000001s)]
*  industry. Do you find it difficult at all to kind of thread the needle between like [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=619.78s)]
*  talking about what the dangers. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=626.94s)]
*  And potential harms of that industry are, while also not further stigmatizing people [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=630.1400000000001s)]
*  who work in that industry. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=636.82s)]
*  Like it seems like it could be a very difficult needle to thread. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=638.62s)]
*  Very. I get a lot of backlash from women in the industry for that reason, actually. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=643.82s)]
*  But to be honest, I care more about the young girls who haven't entered the industry yet [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  and see me and they're like, oh, my God, I love her outfits. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=653.26s)]
*  She's always traveling. I want that life. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=657.78s)]
*  And they don't like that. That that's my number one priority. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=659.66s)]
*  I don't care if another girl is getting mad at me because I'm stigmatizing something. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=663.14s)]
*  I feel like someone's always going to get mad at you about something. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=667.4599999999999s)]
*  And. I. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=670.8599999999999s)]
*  I I don't I don't care. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=674.0999999999999s)]
*  I it is it is very contradictory of me to be on something and tell other people, no, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=676.8199999999999s)]
*  don't join. But I'm not saying don't join. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=681.9s)]
*  I'm saying I'm saying don't. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=683.98s)]
*  Don't don't join on. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=687.5799999999999s)]
*  Don't join so young. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=691.9s)]
*  Don't join us like your first entryway into something. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=693.1s)]
*  Don't join is is like as as it being an answer to all of your problems, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=696.26s)]
*  because it's so difficult to build an audience on there. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=701.42s)]
*  It's so hard. Just don't don't do something you you could you could regret. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=704.8199999999999s)]
*  The Internet is forever. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=709.5799999999999s)]
*  Your digital footprint, especially this day and age, is so important. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=711.6999999999999s)]
*  And I wish I took that so much more seriously 10 years ago. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  The subject of shame is is a complicated one. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  It's the most powerful human emotion. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=724.38s)]
*  It's complicated. I think it it's complicated because particularly from the outside, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=726.06s)]
*  looking at your experience, it can feel like such a cliche and very easy to go. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, you went through through these things like they were shameful things, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=735.54s)]
*  you know, but sex work doesn't have to be shameful. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=739.26s)]
*  It's it's not it's not inherently shameful. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=743.5s)]
*  I'm just wondering if if you can talk through as much as you can, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=746.82s)]
*  like what your relationship with shame is now. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=752.9s)]
*  You know, if you feel like you've gotten past it or maybe on some level, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=758.34s)]
*  like we all never get past it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=761.34s)]
*  No, no, no, I hope I hope not. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=763.18s)]
*  You call people shameless as a negative, like in a derogatory way for a reason. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=765.06s)]
*  I hope that I still have a little bit of shame in me. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=769.18s)]
*  I feel like I feel like I feel like they're in in in small doses. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=771.5s)]
*  It's it's pretty healthy. Why is it healthy? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=776.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, I feel like shame just stops you from from being a complete asshole sometimes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=779.66s)]
*  You know, like it stops you from just being completely disrespectful [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=783.7399999999999s)]
*  and completely rude, like like, have you no shame? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=787.9799999999999s)]
*  That's something that like you got to tell you got to ask yourself once in a while. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=790.66s)]
*  Yeah. So there is there is a healthy amount. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=794.54s)]
*  But then, you know, there's also the other side of shame where even Pixar was like, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  oh, for Inside Out 2, we wanted that to be one of the emotions. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=801.18s)]
*  But everybody got too depressed. It was too sad. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=803.54s)]
*  Like shame is shame is powerful. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=805.86s)]
*  Shame can drive you to to make decisions and that that are terrible. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=807.66s)]
*  And look at yourself in a way that is so negative and and talk to yourself [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=812.3399999999999s)]
*  in a way that just. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=816.54s)]
*  Buries you so deep that you feel like you can't crawl out of it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=818.6999999999999s)]
*  It's so it's so heavy, it's so heavy. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=821.8199999999999s)]
*  And you you really just have to you really just have to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=825.26s)]
*  like think about why why do I feel ashamed of this? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=830.42s)]
*  Do I feel ashamed of it because it it goes against my fundamental beliefs, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=833.42s)]
*  like my core beliefs, or am I feeling ashamed because people are laughing? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=837.78s)]
*  Because if that's the case, then you're not ashamed, you're embarrassed. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=842.6999999999999s)]
*  And embarrassed is a completely different emotion. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=845.3s)]
*  And it requires a completely different set of tools to work through. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=847.5799999999999s)]
*  Do you have a vision of what [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=850.66s)]
*  like an ethical adult film industry would look like or would be? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=853.38s)]
*  What needs to change in that world? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=858.3399999999999s)]
*  I think I think that the predatory contracts need to change. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=860.5s)]
*  I think that the production companies who are given impunity [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=863.74s)]
*  to enforce these contracts, no matter the circumstances, like even if a girl [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=867.2199999999999s)]
*  was, let's say, drugged or under the influence [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=871.2199999999999s)]
*  or or trafficked or all of these awful, awful circumstances. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=874.7s)]
*  That does not matter to them. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=882.58s)]
*  And there's nobody to enforce anything. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=884.1s)]
*  That is a big monster to fight. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=886.46s)]
*  You know, I was just watching the other day. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=889.22s)]
*  There was a talk you gave at the Oxford Union. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=892.74s)]
*  Not that long ago. And during the sort of audience question and answer [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=897.5400000000001s)]
*  portion, a young woman stood up and she prefaced her question to you with, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=902.3000000000001s)]
*  you know, I'm paraphrasing, so maybe I'm not getting the terminology exactly right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=907.4200000000001s)]
*  But she referred to you as as a feminist icon. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  Can you talk about how feminism manifests itself in your work? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=915.0600000000001s)]
*  That's a really good question, because I feel so much imposter syndrome [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=921.9000000000001s)]
*  around being called that. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=925.38s)]
*  Yeah. Why? Because I because I had so much internalized misogyny [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=927.0200000000001s)]
*  that I had to work through, and I feel like that didn't start [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=931.5s)]
*  until I started my therapy journey at 26. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=933.86s)]
*  Like, I I am so ashamed of the things that I've said [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=936.78s)]
*  and thought about myself and allowed others to say and jokes [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=942.1s)]
*  that I went along with and contributed to about myself or about other women [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=945.78s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=949.66s)]
*  I'm extremely ashamed of that, which is why which is why I say [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=951.1s)]
*  there is no being here unless there was change. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=954.34s)]
*  So it's been it's been an evolution on the only fans platform. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=957.54s)]
*  It's it's it's my boundaries. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=961.98s)]
*  It's the way I enforce them. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=964.5s)]
*  It's the way that if someone someone, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=965.9s)]
*  you know, says a word or or describes a body part in a way [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=969.9s)]
*  that's that's more crude than I'll accept, they get blocked on on Twitter, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=972.94s)]
*  on Instagram, on TikTok, all of those platforms. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=977.82s)]
*  I feel like I hope that it manifests in the work that I do. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=980.14s)]
*  The the the people that I platform, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=984.18s)]
*  the things that I talk about in spotlight, like women's reproductive rights [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=987.62s)]
*  and, you know, anti-human and sex trafficking efforts [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  and all of these things, I really, really hope that they come across [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=995.62s)]
*  on those platforms. You referred to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=998.78s)]
*  internalized misogyny. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1003.9399999999999s)]
*  And I mean, really, I think in some ways you're talking about your [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1005.4599999999999s)]

*  Can you just talk to me about what you feel like were the most [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1011.94s)]
*  formative aspects of your growing up and like what are things [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1016.86s)]
*  from your your youth or the culture you were raised in or your family [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1022.1s)]
*  that you feel like you're you're still trying to work through? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1027.3s)]
*  The internalized misogyny actually came more from. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1033.26s)]
*  The American influences, it was it was [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1037.14s)]
*  it was, you know. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1041.22s)]
*  I don't even want to platform the comedians, but it was it was it was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1043.94s)]
*  not being comfortable as a woman in in in brown skin [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1048.46s)]
*  and not being comfortable as an Arab woman. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1053.6599999999999s)]
*  I grew up in D.C. in a post 9-11 world, and there was a lot of just [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1055.54s)]
*  blatant racism. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1060.82s)]
*  And I started to hate myself and I started to very, very much try and, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1062.1399999999999s)]
*  you know, fit myself into the white category like, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1067.34s)]
*  no, I'm wearing Brooks Brothers and Sperry's. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1072.26s)]
*  What do you mean? I'm not brown. I'm not Arab. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1074.54s)]
*  Like I would join in on on jokes like that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1076.74s)]
*  I would I would join in on on jokes against women. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1079.3s)]
*  I would put myself down to to to hope that that I can fit into to places [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1082.02s)]
*  I shouldn't even have been trying to fit into. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1087.02s)]
*  And I carry a lot of shame about that. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1090.02s)]
*  But growing up culturally as an Arab woman, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1092.54s)]
*  the the things that the formative things that kind of like mess [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1096.94s)]
*  mess me up psychologically was more so the guilt, the expectation, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1101.18s)]
*  Catholic guilt, the expectations, all of those things. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1105.94s)]
*  This is maybe connected. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1109.82s)]
*  Maybe it's not. But you were estranged from your family for a while, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1111.94s)]
*  but have recently reconciled or come close to reconciling. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1115.94s)]
*  So can you tell me about why the estrangement happened [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1119.54s)]
*  and how you've been able to heal that? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1122.82s)]
*  Everyone healed through shame. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1126.26s)]
*  I don't talk about my family a lot for for their privacy. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1128.6599999999999s)]
*  They did not choose the life in the public eye. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1131.62s)]
*  And out of respect for them, I do not talk about them. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  But I will say that there was a lot of radical empathy [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1139.26s)]
*  that was practiced within the family that that, you know, made that possible. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1143.1399999999999s)]
*  And I'm really, really, really grateful for that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1147.82s)]
*  I'm really glad you've got gotten there with them. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1151.22s)]
*  Thank you. And to your your Lebanese. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1154.74s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1158.18s)]
*  And this is a very difficult moment for Lebanese people. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1160.1s)]
*  The violence there is escalating. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1165.1s)]
*  Do you do you have friends there? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1167.26s)]
*  Do you have family there? I do. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1169.34s)]
*  I do. Thankfully, they're thankfully they're in the position [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1171.82s)]
*  where they're taking in refugees and and, you know, people who aren't able [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1174.5s)]
*  to cross the borders right now or at least having to flee their homes. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1178.26s)]
*  They're they're able to open their doors and give them a place to stay. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1181.34s)]
*  And that that's the best you can hope for for the situation in Lebanon [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1184.3s)]
*  in Lebanon right now. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1189.1s)]
*  I saw you say in a relatively recent interview that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1190.02s)]
*  You know, you're talking about the idea of politics and what your platform is. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1197.78s)]
*  And you've also talked in this context or just to be specific, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1201.6599999999999s)]
*  like the context of politics and political beliefs about [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1206.98s)]
*  wanting to make a difference in some way. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1212.54s)]
*  So how do you think you're able to make a difference [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1214.9399999999998s)]
*  or how might you be able to make a difference? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1218.5s)]
*  It's it's really just normalizing it, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1220.54s)]
*  making making people see that it's not taboo to talk about it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1223.98s)]
*  It's not talk about what? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1227.5s)]
*  To talk about ending the genocide, to talk about a ceasefire, to talk about [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1229.3s)]
*  to talk about any to talk about, you know, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1232.86s)]
*  anti anti-abortion, to talk about any of these things. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1235.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not taboo. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1239.54s)]
*  It's not a oh, you're an influencer. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1240.54s)]
*  Just do your job. Oh, you're an athlete. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1242.7s)]
*  Keep politics out. Oh, you're this. No, stick to that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1244.26s)]
*  It's not taboo to have an opinion. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1246.98s)]
*  In fact, you are you're an NPC if you don't have an opinion. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1249.02s)]
*  You're you're a non-playable character. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1252.58s)]
*  You're a robot. You're you literally do not do not exist. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1254.1s)]
*  If you if you have no interest in contributing to the fight for human rights [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1258.1s)]
*  or, you know, basic rights domestically or, you know, internationally, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1263.1s)]
*  what are you good for? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1268.66s)]
*  What are you good for? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1270.34s)]
*  Like Pharrell coming out and saying, I don't think celebrities should have [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1271.46s)]
*  opinions on politics, please. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1275.46s)]
*  This is obviously a very difficult [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1278.18s)]
*  subject or set of subjects to talk about. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1282.18s)]
*  I just say, you know, I don't feel like my role here is to [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1284.1s)]
*  condone ideas that you might have about it or to rebut them. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1290.22s)]
*  Her points of view are not mine. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1293.74s)]
*  I want to be clear about that from the outset. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1295.34s)]
*  But here I'm thinking about, you know, I think it was either [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1298.18s)]
*  on October 7th, the last year, or maybe right after October 7th. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1301.14s)]
*  Like two days after. Right. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1304.78s)]
*  You know what I'm going to ask you? Yeah, of course. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1305.98s)]
*  Right. So you posted on X. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1308.06s)]
*  There was one post that was, you know, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1311.66s)]
*  I'm going to paraphrase, but you were [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1315.54s)]
*  suggesting the freedom fighters in Gaza should, you know, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1317.94s)]
*  flip their phones to horizontal in order to better film it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1321.54s)]
*  And then there was another post, I think it was on X. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1324.1s)]
*  Probably right around the same time where there were, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1327.74s)]
*  it's hard to know for sure, but it looks like there were Hamas [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1331.3s)]
*  militants shooting into an Israeli police car. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1334.82s)]
*  And as a result of those posts, some companies that you were in [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1337.98s)]
*  business with decided to stop doing business with you. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1340.86s)]
*  And and I also want to add, you've said while you're anti-Zionist, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1343.14s)]
*  you're in no way anti-Judaism. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1347.98s)]
*  No, and it's very important to not say [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1351.02s)]
*  Jewish people when talking about Zionists. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1354.3s)]
*  To my mind, those posts didn't meet [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1357.1000000000001s)]
*  like the moral tenor of the moment, you know, and I'm not asking you [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1360.5400000000002s)]
*  to like defend or explain those posts. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1365.02s)]
*  But the question I have is. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1367.5800000000002s)]
*  Whether your experience with with those posts [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1371.1000000000001s)]
*  and the reaction that they engendered made you [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1374.8600000000001s)]
*  think differently moving forward about [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1378.98s)]
*  the kinds of posts you want to make [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1383.02s)]
*  about Gaza or about politics [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1386.06s)]
*  or sort of really what the value and use [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1390.5s)]
*  that you can bring to these conversations. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1394.1000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1396.66s)]
*  So. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1397.98s)]
*  If if you'll allow me, I would like a chance to to talk about those tweets. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1400.74s)]
*  Sure. So the first one was not the reason I had said [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1404.42s)]
*  that was because there was a scene that was that was really [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1409.14s)]
*  poetic and symbolic and beautiful. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1414.8600000000001s)]
*  A fence was being broken down and it was it was civilians. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1416.9s)]
*  It was children. It was it was like it felt like [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1420.1000000000001s)]
*  it felt like the Berlin Wall coming down. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1425.7s)]
*  And that's what I was talking about. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1428.38s)]
*  And that's why I said freedom fighters, because every Palestinian who, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1430.46s)]
*  you know, still has a will to live is a freedom fighter. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1435.02s)]
*  That's what it was in reference to. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1437.5s)]
*  And the other one, the photo. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1439.42s)]
*  It it just felt so baroque. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1442.34s)]
*  I do refer to it as looking like a Renaissance. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1445.34s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Like there was there the composition, everything about it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1447.02s)]
*  And I feel like I feel like that's not at the time. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1450.98s)]
*  It was too soon, but I feel like that's not a, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1455.54s)]
*  you know, a radical thing to say about something that that looks so. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1459.26s)]
*  I mean, it it really did. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1463.4599999999998s)]
*  It looked it looked crazy. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1465.1s)]
*  But yeah, the timing was not what I was going to say. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1468.06s)]
*  Was not it was it was too soon. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1472.1799999999998s)]
*  And that's where I stand on that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1475.06s)]
*  And all of the all of the business that I lost because of it [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1479.54s)]
*  was extremely welcomed, because like if we really disagree at that level, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1484.1799999999998s)]
*  we shouldn't be working together in the first place. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1488.8999999999999s)]
*  So I'm not angry about it. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1490.94s)]
*  And I'm actually grateful for it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1492.3799999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, it had to play out like that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1494.62s)]
*  Unfortunately, very like this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1496.82s)]
*  This was the part that that I regret the most. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1499.9399999999998s)]
*  And it was my intention being so misconstrued that people, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1503.02s)]
*  people who were close to me. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1507.54s)]
*  Reached out and and were and were deeply, deeply hurt by what I had said. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1510.3s)]
*  And how did they explain their hurt? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1515.74s)]
*  The same as other people, I cannot believe that you would say something [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1519.3s)]
*  this violently fueled, like I can't then. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1522.62s)]
*  And having to go back and explaining to them [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1526.5s)]
*  my my intention and. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1529.1s)]
*  Apologizing for hurting them and and really, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1532.58s)]
*  really just just making sure that they understand who I am as a person. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1537.22s)]
*  And did that experience incur any changes about [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1540.8999999999999s)]
*  how you think about what to post or or when to post it? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1546.9399999999998s)]
*  Yes, completely. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1550.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes, completely, because because that that was a distraction. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1551.82s)]
*  That was that was not my intention that, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1556.9s)]
*  you know, that's not how I want any of my activism to be. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1560.46s)]
*  I don't want it. That focused on me, not about. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1565.0600000000002s)]
*  And also. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1568.8200000000002s)]
*  As as people of color, we and I'm talking about, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1572.5s)]
*  you know, whether we're fighting for Black Lives Matter here, stateside [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1576.9s)]
*  or a free Palestine or a free Congo, whatever it may be, we [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1580.42s)]
*  we have no room for error. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1585.38s)]
*  We are given no grace. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1587.6200000000001s)]
*  So it takes a lot more. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1589.06s)]
*  I I personally, I have I can only speak for myself. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1593.14s)]
*  I have to I have to put a lot more thought into into what I say, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1596.6200000000001s)]
*  and I have to make sure that context is always there now. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1601.46s)]
*  I do move differently with the things I say online, and it's [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1604.82s)]
*  it's not it's not in a in a way to censor myself. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1608.06s)]
*  It's in a way to make sure that anything I'm doing [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1610.86s)]
*  isn't deterring from the big picture. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1613.62s)]
*  On your platforms, the content can be so [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1615.4199999999998s)]
*  just different is the term, you know, you can you can post [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1621.26s)]
*  like sort of a playful food video on talk on TikTok [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1624.5s)]
*  and then have, you know, a pretty strident set of of tweets [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1628.1s)]
*  about Gaza on on X. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1633.9399999999998s)]
*  Like, how do you think the people who follow you across these platforms? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1637.5s)]
*  Like, take in those disparate types of content. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1642.82s)]
*  Like, do you do you do you have a sense of whether or not [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1647.5s)]
*  the person who is following you on TikTok because they like your [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1650.78s)]
*  dance videos or food videos is like paying attention to the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1654.9399999999998s)]
*  political tweets or are they are are they [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1659.82s)]
*  seeing one and ignoring the other? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1663.4199999999998s)]
*  Is it like a mishmash in people's head? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1664.8999999999999s)]
*  Is it a mishmash in your head? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  Like, how do you it seems so like such sort of a like [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1667.6599999999999s)]
*  like it would induce almost like psychological vertigo. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1671.62s)]
*  Oh, my God. Thank you so much for for being able to see that. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1674.58s)]
*  That is very representative of the chaos in my head. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1678.26s)]
*  It's pure like it's it's absolutely chaos. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1681.2199999999998s)]
*  Is it sort of just like yelling into the into the void or is it? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1683.2199999999998s)]
*  It feels like it. But then I run into people on the street [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1687.6599999999999s)]
*  and they're like, thank you so much for sharing that. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1689.58s)]
*  And I was like, and I'm like, oh, oh, my like that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1691.3799999999999s)]
*  It really it really hits me that these things these things do have impact [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1695.1799999999998s)]
*  and they are reaching people. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1699.3s)]
*  And if if other people see it and feel the same way I did, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1701.14s)]
*  then that is the best that I can hope for. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1704.8200000000002s)]
*  Do you feel like there are things that you don't want to talk about [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1707.14s)]
*  or feel like, you know, it could sort of [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1709.8600000000001s)]
*  could be too dangerous to the brand if you talked about like, how do you think? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1714.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm so, so, so grateful that my my [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1719.14s)]
*  like my my brand as, you know, a public figure is completely different [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1723.98s)]
*  from my actual brand as a business owner. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1727.5400000000002s)]
*  And a designer is it though, aren't they kind of one in the same? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1731.02s)]
*  It's it's it's blended. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1734.26s)]
*  But at the same time, it is it is very the the lines are very blurred. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1737.1399999999999s)]
*  Me as a brand is the same person as me as a person. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1741.82s)]
*  Of course, you know, I it's it's a lot more glamorous and all of that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1746.3s)]
*  But but me as a brand, actually. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1750.54s)]
*  No, no, it's it's not the that question. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1755.62s)]
*  The more I tried to answer it, the more my own mind changed about it, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1760.26s)]
*  because that's actually something I'm very, very, very proud of. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1763.7s)]
*  My my my brand, Chetan, is first and foremost a jewelry brand [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1767.0600000000002s)]
*  and then a bodywear brand. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1772.18s)]
*  And the thing that that I love about it so much is that we have no investors. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1773.7800000000002s)]
*  It's all me. It's self-funded, which means I answer to nobody. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1778.98s)]
*  If I want to donate a portion of proceeds to wherever I want to donate, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1783.3400000000001s)]
*  no one is going to tell me no. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1787.14s)]
*  No one is going to take it away from me because they disagree with my opinions. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1788.7s)]
*  And same with the production company that I've started. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1792.1000000000001s)]
*  People can choose not to work with me. That's everybody's right. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1796.1000000000001s)]
*  But no one can take it away from me because they disagree with with my opinions. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1798.8600000000001s)]
*  What kind of stuff is the production company going to work on? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1802.9s)]
*  Well, for now unscripted, but I'm not against, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1805.7s)]
*  you know, entering the world of scripted. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1810.1000000000001s)]
*  I've kind of dabbled in it a little bit with a show called. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1811.94s)]
*  You were in Rami. I was. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1814.5400000000002s)]
*  I love I love Rami so much. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1816.9s)]
*  The the work that he does is also so inspirational and so incredible. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1818.5s)]
*  And just that show alone. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1823.22s)]
*  Oh, my God, it makes me want to cry thinking about it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1825.78s)]
*  If I had had a show like that when I was a teenager growing up, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1827.98s)]
*  I really think that things would have been different. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1831.06s)]
*  It's it's it's really hard not to see yourself in in people. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1832.82s)]
*  And and having having someone that you identify with, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1838.9s)]
*  having representation in in seats at tables that you never thought were possible [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1842.86s)]
*  makes such a big difference, which is why it's important to put myself [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1847.34s)]
*  in those positions because people need representation. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1850.9399999999998s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about about Arab girls. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1853.9799999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about I'm talking about girls who have made decisions [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1856.4199999999998s)]
*  that they regret that the world might have written them off for. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1859.86s)]
*  I feel like that's a good place to stop for now. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1862.4599999999998s)]
*  But I'll talk to you again later in the week. Definitely. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1865.54s)]
*  After the break, Mia shares how she handles the emotional ups [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1867.82s)]
*  and downs of life online. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1871.54s)]
*  Hey, Mia, how are you? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1877.5s)]
*  I'm good. How are you, David? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1879.26s)]
*  Good, good. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1881.1399999999999s)]
*  Just as a point of clarification, you know, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1883.1s)]
*  for people who might not be familiar with all the platforms that we're talking about. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1886.3s)]
*  Can you explain sort of what's different from a business standpoint [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1890.54s)]
*  about being a creator on only fans, as opposed to [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1895.18s)]
*  being an adult industry performer in a more traditional way? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1899.98s)]
*  No contract. You own all of your own content, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1906.18s)]
*  which is imperative and so important. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1909.18s)]
*  The reason that that I am, you know, in the situation that I'm in [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1911.58s)]
*  is because I have no legal standing whatsoever [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1915.94s)]
*  to any of the content that was created during the time with the production company. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1920.02s)]
*  They own all of that. They own the rights. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1924.78s)]
*  They own everything. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1927.02s)]
*  It's it's such an exploitative standard contract [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1928.98s)]
*  that gets put in front of every single girl that steps foot into those offices. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1933.18s)]
*  And I. Yeah, that's that's the difference. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1937.1000000000001s)]
*  That's the reason why I if someone is joining the sex work industry, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1941.3400000000001s)]
*  I implore them to do it on a site like OnlyFans, where if they if they actually want to go off, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1946.18s)]
*  they can delete all of their content. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1952.06s)]
*  Granted, you know, people leaking it and people redistributing it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1953.46s)]
*  But it's it's watermarked. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1957.3400000000001s)]
*  It's, you know, the metadata is there. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1958.8600000000001s)]
*  And you have full control over over over over your page. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1962.14s)]
*  If you want to take it down, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1966.6200000000001s)]
*  OnlyFans has no claim whatsoever to any of that content. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1967.94s)]
*  You know, a big recurring theme in some of the things you've talked about [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1973.6200000000001s)]
*  is sort of agency and autonomy. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1979.18s)]
*  And that includes bodily autonomy. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1982.66s)]
*  And you've you've been open online about sort of having surgery [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1985.8200000000002s)]
*  to augment your appearance and being on Ozempic. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1991.74s)]
*  And do the choices to do those types of things also feel like they're coming [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=1995.14s)]
*  from a place of agency and bodily autonomy? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2000.5800000000002s)]
*  Or do you feel pressure to have made those choices? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2004.02s)]
*  Like, is there any internal conflict there? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2007.6200000000001s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2010.7s)]
*  I and I the reason that I talk about it is because I kind of like showing [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2011.54s)]
*  the dichotomy behind changing yourself. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2015.5800000000002s)]
*  When I when I got my my rhinoplasty, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2019.02s)]
*  I needed to make a point of of making sure that my nose stays ethnic. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2021.8600000000001s)]
*  I I want to tweak what I don't like about it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2027.18s)]
*  But I still want like a strong, beautiful Arabic nose. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2031.22s)]
*  And it took me a long time to find the right surgeon [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2034.66s)]
*  who understood the nuance of that and understood that plastic surgery [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2037.3s)]
*  isn't about changing yourself, it's about it's about improving what you want to improve. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2041.42s)]
*  Same with my breast augmentation. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2046.38s)]
*  I had lost. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2047.6200000000001s)]
*  60, 75 pounds very naturally when I was in my early 20s [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2049.18s)]
*  and and my breasts completely changed, I didn't feel like a young woman. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2053.46s)]
*  I felt I felt it was just a lot of excess skin. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2056.82s)]
*  I had to have a lift before I could even have my implants put in. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2060.34s)]
*  So that was my reasoning behind that. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2063.78s)]
*  And then Ozempic was honestly, it was such a big trend and I wanted to try it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2065.94s)]
*  And then it completely took so much pressure off of me when I when I was traveling. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2071.18s)]
*  And the food options were ordering Uber Eats at 11 o'clock at night [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2075.5s)]
*  and then feeling bloated for a shoot the next day and all of these things. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2080.3s)]
*  And going on it, it also it also changed my relationship with a lot of things. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2083.54s)]
*  Just my just my negative mindset and outlook and relationship with food. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2089.82s)]
*  It completely changed that. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2095.9s)]
*  And then I was able to eat anything I wanted to, but it would just fill me up faster. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2097.14s)]
*  So I started to speak openly about that because I was getting a lot of compliments [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2102.06s)]
*  about how how good I looked and and my workout routine. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2106.42s)]
*  I felt very guilty perpetuating or or selling something that that wasn't real, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2110.06s)]
*  even though it was it's kind of it's kind of weird to promote something [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2116.02s)]
*  that's for diabetes that people don't have access to. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2120.9s)]
*  So I struggled with with talking about it a little bit. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2124.22s)]
*  But at the end of the day, there was there was a teenage girl who who I knew, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2126.8999999999996s)]
*  who messaged me and was like, oh, my God, what's your workout routine? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2132.18s)]
*  And I had to tell her, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2134.5s)]
*  That was what made me be more open about that. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2137.2599999999998s)]
*  And are generally people supportive [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2140.58s)]
*  when you sort of pull the curtain back on these sorts of things? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2144.1s)]
*  Or are people critical? What's the response been? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2147.4199999999996s)]
*  Honestly, I don't know. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2151.74s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2154.7s)]
*  I'm open about it because I feel a sense of guilt about getting complemented [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2155.7799999999997s)]
*  when when it's not like it's not a natural thing. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2161.1s)]
*  I think I think gatekeeping or lying about what you've had done [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2164.66s)]
*  is the biggest sign of maybe you shouldn't have that procedure. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2168.94s)]
*  And, you know, I think it's a normal [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2174.54s)]
*  sort of human experience with technology to, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2178.3799999999997s)]
*  you know, you get older and then you just start feeling like you don't have a natural [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2183.54s)]
*  aptitude or facility with different technologies or social media platforms. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2189.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, I'm not on TikTok. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2193.5s)]
*  It's not I don't feel like I would really enjoy being on TikTok. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2195.46s)]
*  I just feel like, oh, this is not for me. Like, I missed my window. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2200.18s)]
*  Do you have any of those concerns for yourself? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2203.58s)]
*  Like your livelihood is tied to social media. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2206.9s)]
*  Do you ever think, oh, well, maybe some new thing will come. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2209.8599999999997s)]
*  And I won't quite know how to adapt to it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2211.74s)]
*  Oh, completely. Be real. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2214.9399999999996s)]
*  That was the worst three months of my entire life. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2216.8599999999997s)]
*  I I hated Be Real. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2219.4199999999996s)]
*  Wait, I'm not going to pretend to know what Be Real is. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2223.02s)]
*  Oh, my God. Be Real was this app that came out where you would get [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2225.74s)]
*  you would get two notifications a day and you had three minutes to open [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2229.1s)]
*  the app and take a photo and you only get three chances to take the photo. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2232.66s)]
*  And it takes a photo with your front facing camera and the back camera [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2236.18s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2239.22s)]
*  So people like it was it was it was the only way to organic flex. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2240.4199999999996s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2245.8999999999996s)]
*  Like, obviously, Instagram, you can you can post old photos. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2247.02s)]
*  You can you can edit things. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2250.7s)]
*  This was the test to like prove that you're actually cool and out and doing things. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2252.2599999999998s)]
*  And I I hated that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2256.8599999999997s)]
*  And did you ever feel with [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2261.98s)]
*  sort of creating content about [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2264.06s)]
*  about avoiding burnout? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2267.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2270.02s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm thinking of like where you feel like, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2271.14s)]
*  oh, I just have to constantly be making stuff or because if I go away for a week, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2273.78s)]
*  like it's going to hurt me in the algorithm. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2278.82s)]
*  Not at all. My mental health is more important than anything. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2281.9s)]
*  Like I am never going to push myself to do things that I don't want to ever again. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2284.98s)]
*  And how does your mental health feel now? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2290.14s)]
*  Do you feel like you're in a good, sustainable place with what you're doing? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2295.58s)]
*  I feel like I'm really good at compartmentalizing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2300.2999999999997s)]
*  Like I'm having this beautiful conversation with you and and my my tone is light, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2302.66s)]
*  but I have Al Jazeera muted with my eyes glued to it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2307.7s)]
*  And I was like to this call, honestly, because I was checking in with with my friends [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2311.22s)]
*  and all of this is playing out in real time. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2316.2999999999997s)]
*  But I just I've learned to compartmentalize. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2319.1s)]
*  Like I have two more meetings after this today and then I'm allowed my allotted time to cry. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2321.8599999999997s)]
*  Shame is another thing that's come up a couple of times in the conversation. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2328.7s)]
*  Do you have any advice for people about how to deal with shame? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2333.1s)]
*  Oh, my God, everybody is so different. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2338.02s)]
*  But my my best piece of advice is is to be kind to yourself and be compassionate [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2340.38s)]
*  and give yourself the same grace that you would give a friend that you're talking to [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2345.66s)]
*  because you're never going to tell them [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2349.8599999999997s)]
*  grow up, you know, be stronger. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2353.06s)]
*  Like you're never going to talk to someone that you love that way. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2355.06s)]
*  So if you talk to yourself the with the same grace that you would give other people, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2358.2599999999998s)]
*  that that starts to go a long way. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2362.4599999999996s)]
*  It's also very much easier said than done. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2365.9399999999996s)]
*  Completely, completely. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2369.3399999999997s)]
*  And my second piece of advice is is fine is paying someone to do that for you once a week. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2371.9s)]
*  A therapist, you mean? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2378.86s)]
*  Because that's really how it works. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2379.86s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2381.26s)]
*  That's Mia Khalifa. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2385.42s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2386.94s)]
*  And this is the interview from The New York Times. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_vxCxt0VU&t=2388.1s)]
