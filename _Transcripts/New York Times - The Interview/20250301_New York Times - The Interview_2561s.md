# Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey Wants Democrats to Fight
**New York Times - The Interview:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30)
*  We will fight it out in Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=0.0s)]
*  We will fight it out in the courts. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2.6s)]
*  We will fight it out across this country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=5.28s)]
*  After a few weeks of caution, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=9.0s)]
*  Democrats are now starting to fight back [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  against an emboldened President Donald Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=13.24s)]
*  That's happening on the streets, in the courts, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=16.16s)]
*  and even in the White House. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=18.76s)]
*  It's a nice, friendly group. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=20.64s)]
*  Lovely. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=22.32s)]
*  At the annual Governors Association meeting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=23.44s)]
*  in Washington last weekend, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=25.48s)]
*  President Trump took the opportunity to scold [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=27.12s)]
*  Maine's Democratic Governor Janet Mills [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=29.52s)]
*  over her promise to challenge his executive order [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=32.12s)]
*  banning transgender women from women's sports. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=35.16s)]
*  Are you not going to comply with it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=38.24s)]
*  I'm complying with state and federal law. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=40.36s)]
*  Well, we are the federal law. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=42.6s)]
*  Well, you better do it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=45.16s)]
*  You better do it because you're not going to get [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  any federal funding at all if you don't. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=47.64s)]
*  Trump's promise to use federal funding to get his way [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=49.8s)]
*  is a new tactic that could especially hurt [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Democratic governors, who now have to make a choice [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  between standing up to Trump or keeping federal funds [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=58.56s)]
*  flowing into their states. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Among those caught in that position [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=63.68s)]
*  is Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=65.48s)]
*  What I saw as so upsetting in that exchange [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=67.8s)]
*  was when he said, we are the federal law. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=71.0s)]
*  Healey is a former civil rights lawyer who, in 2014, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=75.2s)]
*  became the nation's first openly gay state attorney general. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=78.16s)]
*  In 2022, she won the governorship. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  And while she may not have the same national profile [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  as some of her colleagues, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  she's known as being deeply influential in the party. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=88.4s)]
*  So I wanted to talk to Healey about how she, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=92.16s)]
*  as the governor of a blue state, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=94.88s)]
*  thinks her party can wage an effective fight. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=96.44s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro, and here's my interview [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=99.76s)]
*  with the governor of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=102.24s)]
*  Governor Healey, you just returned from D.C. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=104.64s)]
*  for the annual National Governors Association meeting, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=115.68s)]
*  and you attended an event with the president, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=119.24s)]
*  along with other Democratic and Republican governors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=122.08s)]
*  What did you discuss with the other governors? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=124.8s)]
*  Well, you go to the White House. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=127.76s)]
*  I've been as governor with other presidents. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=130.2s)]
*  I've been as attorney general. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=132.24s)]
*  And you go with the expectation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=134.0s)]
*  that you're going to hear the president [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=135.6s)]
*  articulate some vision for the future. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=138.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be an opportunity to talk about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=140.52s)]
*  how governors and states can work with a new administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=142.72s)]
*  That wasn't what this was about. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=147.56s)]
*  The meeting began with an address by Stephen Miller [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=149.44s)]
*  for about 15, 20 minutes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=152.8s)]
*  And then later, the president came out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=154.8s)]
*  and began by recounting that he's got [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=157.68s)]
*  the highest approval rating of anybody this early in his tenure, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=161.72s)]
*  that he won the election not once, not twice, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=165.84s)]
*  but three times, and then continued with a litany [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=168.48s)]
*  of conspiracy theories and false information. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=171.92s)]
*  So it was unfortunate because on there as governor thinking, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=175.64s)]
*  let's have a conversation about maybe where we can work together, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  How can we focus on the needs of everyday Americans? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=182.96s)]
*  But unfortunately, we didn't see any of that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=185.88s)]
*  What was also upsetting is that we saw him attack another governor. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=188.68s)]
*  This is something that... [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  The governor of Maine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  The governor of Maine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=195.4s)]
*  Now, this follows, remember, a few weeks ago, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=196.32s)]
*  he attacked Illinois and Governor Pritzker. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=198.84s)]
*  He attacked Governor Hockel in New York recently. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=201.16s)]
*  He's now very gratuitously, in a way it seemed very manufactured [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=204.36s)]
*  in the moment, attacked the governor of Maine. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=208.36s)]
*  And we should say this was about transgender rights [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=212.36s)]
*  and about his executive order to do with transgender rights. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=215.24s)]
*  And then he called her out, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=217.84s)]
*  And then she responded basically that she would follow the laws of her state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  And the federal government. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=225.32s)]
*  And the federal government and that she would see him in court. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=226.08s)]
*  And that didn't seem to go down well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=228.4s)]
*  No, and it was about transgender rights, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=229.76s)]
*  but it wasn't about transgender rights. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=233.04s)]
*  He is doing what he has done typically, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  which is I am going to throw out some issue, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  let that be the distraction, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=240.72s)]
*  let that distract everyone from the fact that my poll numbers are tanking. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=242.56s)]
*  People don't like what Elon Musk and Doge are doing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=246.92s)]
*  And let's get everybody's eye off the ball. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=251.72s)]
*  So let me go pick on this particular governor [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=253.68s)]
*  about an action that she hasn't even taken. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=256.32s)]
*  She has not even taken an action around transgender issues. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=258.88s)]
*  And yet he manufactures something and she appropriately says, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=262.36s)]
*  I'm going to follow state and federal law, Mr. President, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=267.76s)]
*  which I think is the right answer of you want your electeds to follow state and federal law. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  What I saw is so upsetting in that exchange was when he looked at her [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=275.88s)]
*  and I was sitting at the table and he leered at her and he said, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=281.12s)]
*  we are the federal law. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  We are the federal law. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=289.08s)]
*  And what did you hear when he said that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=291.08s)]
*  I heard somebody who thinks he's king. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=293.24s)]
*  Congress makes the laws. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=295.48s)]
*  I may not agree with everything Congress does, but that's a democracy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=297.04s)]
*  That's how our system works. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=300.24s)]
*  Congress makes the laws. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  The judiciary enforces the laws and determines the application of the law. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=305.36s)]
*  And the executive, and I'm an executive, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=311.56s)]
*  my job is to faithfully apply and execute the law. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  And so that's a problem. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=319.24s)]
*  He doesn't believe that Congress makes the law. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=322.68s)]
*  He believes that he makes the law. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=324.68s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  The other thing he said as you will see no federal funding, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=328.08s)]
*  which again is counter to the way our system operates, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=331.24s)]
*  which is Congress appropriates funds. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=336.24s)]
*  Congress debates and figures out where funding is going to go. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=339.16s)]
*  And the idea that he's going to withhold weaponized funding is terrible. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=342.88s)]
*  What was the feeling afterwards among the Democratic governors in particular, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=348.04s)]
*  after that exchange? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=352.28s)]
*  I feel a lot of anger. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=354.28s)]
*  I feel anger for the people I am elected to serve. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=355.96s)]
*  And I think a lot of us feel that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=360.28s)]
*  And so as governor, I am focused on delivering for people here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=361.76s)]
*  How do I lower their costs? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=365.88s)]
*  How do I build more homes? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=367.6s)]
*  How do I lower taxes? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=369.2s)]
*  How do I make sure that kids are educated, that our communities are safe, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=370.48s)]
*  That our veterans are taken care of. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  And in the face of that, we have Donald Trump, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=376.8s)]
*  who's teamed up with his co-king, co-president, Elon Musk. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=380.24s)]
*  That also became quite clear. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  And they are doing everything it seems to cut jobs. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at all the layoffs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  And remember, a third of the federal employee workforce are veterans. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=394.12s)]
*  And they've been laid off, let go, fired by the tens of thousands. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=399.04s)]
*  They're also doing everything they can to increase costs, it seems. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=403.56s)]
*  Tariffs, which would be devastating. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=407.88s)]
*  Going to raise the price of everything that we buy and rely on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=410.24s)]
*  So they are acting in ways that are diametrically opposed to what we're trying to do as governors, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=414.76s)]
*  causing a lot of hurt, a lot of chaos. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=421.28s)]
*  I'll give you an example, Lulu. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=423.28s)]
*  Massachusetts. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=425.08s)]
*  We're home to life sciences. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=426.4s)]
*  There is a ton of research and innovation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=428.64s)]
*  We're number one in healthcare. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=431.76s)]
*  And here within Massachusetts, we depend on funding from the National Institute of Health, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=433.52s)]
*  as do a lot of states, so-called red states and blue states. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=439.88s)]
*  He wants to cut all of that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=445.84s)]
*  Which means that people who right now are researching the cure for your child if they get cancer, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=448.0s)]
*  or researching the cure, the treatment for Alzheimer's, are no longer going to have access to that funding. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=455.24s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=463.56s)]
*  Governor, one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is because I am interested to know [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=465.2s)]
*  how democratic governors are seeing this moment and how to maneuver in the second Trump era. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=471.72s)]
*  Until now, you've been not as publicly combative as perhaps other governors have been. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=478.56s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that's because Donald Trump is seemingly more willing to be punitive, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=484.92s)]
*  or is it because his policies have been popular? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=495.08s)]
*  I mean, what are you weighing when you're thinking about how to talk about this administration? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=498.6s)]
*  Look, I was attorney general throughout the Trump 1 presidency, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=504.68s)]
*  and joined and led many cases suing him. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=511.08s)]
*  So I'm not unfamiliar with the way he operates. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  It's incredibly important for AGs to continue to be in the courts. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=517.8399999999999s)]
*  They, like we, back during Trump 1, are having success. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=522.36s)]
*  How I look at things is it's been consistent for me. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  If the president is going to work and support the state of Massachusetts, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=530.6s)]
*  I will work with the president and the federal administration. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=533.72s)]
*  When he is not, then I will be the first to stand up and fight for the people of Massachusetts. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  I think that is probably the attitude of most Democratic governors, at least. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=541.36s)]
*  You, of course, were AG. You have direct experience with this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=547.44s)]
*  I am curious if you really do think that how the AGs are operating, if it's the best way. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=550.84s)]
*  Because, for example, you were accused of politicizing the AG's office by jumping into national issues. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=555.76s)]
*  It's something that is often said about AGs. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  And that was in the first Trump administration. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=564.4s)]
*  Then under Biden, you had Republican AGs adopting that model, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  going after things that Biden did. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=570.6s)]
*  And now, again, we have these group filings from multiple states targeting executive actions. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=572.84s)]
*  It's become this kind of pattern. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=579.0s)]
*  And I'm curious, do you think that AGs should be getting in these federal fights so consistently? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=580.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the premise of that question is totally off. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=586.32s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=589.16s)]
*  And I think the notion that these are, quote, political fights is totally off. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=589.76s)]
*  When I brought suits as an attorney general and when other AGs, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=595.48s)]
*  I worked with, brought suits because a lot of these were multi-state suits. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=600.2s)]
*  Why were they multi-state suits? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=603.96s)]
*  Why were a bunch of AGs joining in the same lawsuit? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=605.88s)]
*  It's because there was some action taken by Trump during Trump 1 that hurt people in our states. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=610.12s)]
*  As attorney general, you're there to represent the people of your state, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=618.6s)]
*  to protect their interests and to protect their rights. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=622.84s)]
*  So when somebody like Donald Trump illegally cuts off access to health care, violates the law, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=627.56s)]
*  of course, your AG can and should sue. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  That's not a political issue. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=638.5999999999999s)]
*  That's an attorney general doing his or her job, vindicating- [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=640.12s)]
*  Then you saw Republicans do the same, obviously, during the Biden administration. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=644.52s)]
*  And they would argue that they were doing the same thing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  They can argue that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=651.8s)]
*  They can argue that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=652.8399999999999s)]
*  I will tell you, having worked with many Republican colleagues, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=653.56s)]
*  I will tell you what those fights were about. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=657.56s)]
*  They were fights to gum up the works, to slow things down. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=659.64s)]
*  They didn't like some of the policy making that was going on. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=662.5999999999999s)]
*  They didn't like the fact that EPA was out there promoting [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  and promulgating new regulations, for example. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=669.16s)]
*  And so they tried to find ways to slow that down. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=672.52s)]
*  I'm not saying in every instance it was frivolous, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  but there's a reason why Democratic AGs won over 85% of those cases during Trump won. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=678.92s)]
*  We were right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  And I think that's what you're going to see again now with Trump too. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=686.92s)]
*  Now, the courts have changed some. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=689.88s)]
*  So how this ultimately plays out- [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=691.64s)]
*  I was about to say, are you confident that the courts can actually [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=693.3199999999999s)]
*  constrain this administration? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=695.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, I have great hope in the courts. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=697.16s)]
*  They're an important institution. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=700.12s)]
*  They're one of our pillars of government. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=702.28s)]
*  So I want to remain ever optimistic about the role of and the responsibility of the judiciary. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=705.0s)]
*  I can't predict how it's going to go. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=714.04s)]
*  But those lawsuits, where there's a violation of the law, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  those AGs need to continue to sue. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=722.68s)]
*  And that's not political. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=724.92s)]
*  It's about doing their job and vindicating people's rights in their states. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=726.92s)]
*  But it's not just up to the AGs. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=732.5999999999999s)]
*  I think about senators like Chris Murphy and Brian Schatz out there just articulating, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=734.36s)]
*  just in very real terms, what the harm of Trump's actions are to everyday Americans. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=740.44s)]
*  You see more and more Americans speaking up too. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=746.04s)]
*  And that's really, really important because I think it's been overwhelming for a lot of people. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=749.32s)]
*  It's only been a month, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=754.52s)]
*  And people have been hit with a lot. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=756.36s)]
*  It did seem to catch Democrats by surprise. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=759.0s)]
*  I mean, we've seen Democrats take a beat. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=761.72s)]
*  And have trouble coming to an agreement about what kind of resistance or opposition they're going to pose. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=764.52s)]
*  You've talked a little bit about what's happening publicly. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm curious what has been happening privately because one of my colleagues reported that you [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  were part of a group of Democratic governors in January who privately urged Senator Chuck Schumer [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=781.24s)]
*  to fight harder, or at least differently against Trump. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=788.4399999999999s)]
*  And I'm curious what you were wanting to see that you weren't seeing. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=791.0s)]
*  I thought at the outset it was very important for leadership in Congress, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=794.76s)]
*  to be out every day with members talking about the things that Trump is doing. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=801.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=806.6s)]
*  Because what he's been doing from the beginning is taking away Congress's power. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=807.32s)]
*  All of his action has been him saying basically, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=814.28s)]
*  I know maybe he doesn't know. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=818.12s)]
*  Congress, you're supposed to make the law. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=819.96s)]
*  But no, I'm making the law now. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=821.48s)]
*  I am usurping your authority. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=823.0s)]
*  I am appropriating congressional authority, which is why I thought at the outset, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=825.48s)]
*  Congress and members of Congress each day have got to be out there explaining to the [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=830.52s)]
*  American people and everyday Americans, this isn't right. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=834.12s)]
*  This isn't legal. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=837.32s)]
*  They needed to be speaking up to that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=838.36s)]
*  Do you think the leadership in Congress is the right leadership to enact what you're envisioning? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=840.04s)]
*  I'll leave that for members of Congress to decide. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=847.48s)]
*  I'm a governor. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=850.36s)]
*  That's not my call. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=851.0s)]
*  What I can tell you is we need leadership that is aggressive, that is proactive, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=852.36s)]
*  and that is speaking to everyday Americans. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=858.52s)]
*  It sounds like you're aligning the question. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=861.32s)]
*  I don't mean to align anything. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=863.88s)]
*  I'll say that I think part of what got the Democratic Party in trouble this last election [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=865.08s)]
*  is the fact that there was a perception that, and I think it lived out to a certain extent [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=871.08s)]
*  among Democratic leadership, that they just didn't have their finger on the pulse. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=876.2s)]
*  They're talking about issues that weren't bread and butter, core economic issues that resonate. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=882.84s)]
*  They allowed themselves in some ways to be caricatured as only caring about X, Y, and Z issue, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  which isn't true, by the way. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=897.48s)]
*  One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is that I was told by quite a few Democrats that you are [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  very influential in the party, beyond your state. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=904.76s)]
*  As you have been having these conversations about moving the party forward, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=909.88s)]
*  I did want to get your temperature on just the Democratic brand writ large, because polling is [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=917.7199999999999s)]
*  showing that the Democratic brand is really underwater, regardless of what's happening [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=923.56s)]
*  with Donald Trump and what's happening in the White House. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=929.48s)]
*  The losses were steep in the last election. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=932.6s)]
*  You are the governor of a solidly blue state. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=936.04s)]
*  What was your big takeaway about why the Democrats did so badly? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=939.24s)]
*  There's definitely a brand problem. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=947.88s)]
*  There's a big brand problem. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=949.88s)]
*  I don't pretend to speak for the party, but I can tell you as a Democratic leader, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=954.52s)]
*  what I'm going to do, I'm going to focus on driving what I believe is a Democratic message. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=958.6s)]
*  Let's take this moment and redefine the brand. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=964.28s)]
*  To me, the Democratic brand should be about delivering for everyday Americans. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=967.16s)]
*  We have the chance to do that with the foil of Donald Trump, cutting all these programs, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=972.84s)]
*  cutting our military, for God's sakes, to free up funding that will pay for the tax cuts he [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  wants to give to billionaires. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=985.4s)]
*  What can we do as Democrats? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=987.32s)]
*  Where do I think we need to go if I was going to offer advice? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=989.64s)]
*  It's to every day tack towards and have your North Star be, what am I doing for everyday Americans? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=993.96s)]
*  But I'm curious, Governor, because I think if you talk to any Democrat, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1002.12s)]
*  the Biden administration on down, they would say that that was their focus. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1006.2s)]
*  They would say that that is precisely what they did during the last four years. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1011.64s)]
*  They really tried to build up the economy out of a massive recession. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1017.72s)]
*  They tried to tackle inflation, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1025.0s)]
*  And so I am curious how you see that being different than what happened before. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1028.04s)]
*  I think there are differences. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1034.44s)]
*  There are differences. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1036.12s)]
*  I told President Biden directly a few years ago that he needed to be active on the border, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1037.32s)]
*  that he should take executive action on the border. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1043.0s)]
*  I knew that as an attorney general and as a former prosecutor. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1046.28s)]
*  There were things that could have been done, and I wish that he had done that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1049.2399999999998s)]
*  So I also think it's important to fight back. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1052.76s)]
*  When there was all this talk and denigration of DEI, I don't know why the response wasn't, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1057.7199999999998s)]
*  you know what? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1062.84s)]
*  It's actually good to have women and people of color in the military. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1063.72s)]
*  It's good to have women and people of color in the workforce. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1067.32s)]
*  It's good to have women and people of color going to colleges and universities. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1070.9199999999998s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1076.9199999999998s)]
*  And put it back on them instead of it being allowed to be this [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1078.4399999999998s)]
*  intenuated caricatured conversation about quote DEI. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  And some of it's about how you match the mischaracterization and how you match really [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1087.24s)]
*  offensive but effective attempts to strike down certain things or to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1096.92s)]
*  pit people against each other. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1104.28s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1105.8s)]
*  If you're getting bullied and you don't respond with force, the bully's going to win always. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1108.12s)]
*  And we need people who are able to do that and to do that effectively and in a way that shows that [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1115.48s)]
*  we're actually aligned with the majority of Americans on this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1123.08s)]
*  And that, I think, that's a work in progress. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1128.28s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Do you blame part of the failure to defend the Democratic brand, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1133.24s)]
*  to articulate the vision on the Biden administration? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1138.84s)]
*  You were the first Democratic governor to publicly urge President Biden to exit the race in July of [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1143.88s)]
*  last year. How much do you think it hurt the party in voters' eyes that it seemed like Democrats were [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1148.76s)]
*  sort of hiding President Biden's failing acuity? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1156.0400000000002s)]
*  KATE BOWE I think that President Biden, the Biden administration, did so much for this country and [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1158.76s)]
*  pulled us through a pandemic, pulled us out of a really dark economic time, got us on really solid [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1165.64s)]
*  footing, did some incredible things. I think the party was hampered by having President Biden as [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1172.28s)]
*  the communicator in chief, for being honest. He wasn't the strongest communicator in chief. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1180.6s)]
*  And that hurt us because they weren't able to sell all of the important accomplishments [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1186.44s)]
*  that were actually, in fact, happening effectively or as effectively. And that definitely hurt. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1193.48s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Do you think the party is adequately reckoning now with the effects [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1199.96s)]
*  of what happened though? Because I just saw one of Biden's senior advisors, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1203.48s)]
*  Mike Donilon, say that the Democratic Party, quote, lost its mind after Biden's poor debate and [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1207.3999999999999s)]
*  basically threw an incumbent under the bus and that cost them the election. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1214.52s)]
*  KATE BOWE I hadn't seen that comment. Are we grappling with what happened and having to deal [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1219.72s)]
*  with it right now? You better believe it. We've got Donald Trump in the White House. But I've [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1227.96s)]
*  talked before about this and my views about President Biden. And I think it was very hard [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1234.76s)]
*  for Kamala Harris, who I thought ran a fantastic campaign, to be able to overcome the disadvantage [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1241.64s)]
*  at the time and within the time that she was allotted. And I think it would have been a [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1248.6000000000001s)]
*  different story if the president had decided a few years ago that he was going to do what he said [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1252.04s)]
*  he would do, which is serve one term, and then we'd have the opportunity for full engagement [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1257.24s)]
*  in a primary and the like. That didn't happen. I have no interest in further spending time on it, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1262.1200000000001s)]
*  revisiting history. I'm focused on the now. LESLIE KENDRICK Governor Healey, the number two issue [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1268.68s)]
*  in your state, according to polling, is immigration, which is something that has plagued Democrats in [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1273.8s)]
*  the last election. 2023 was the year where states like yours saw a big surge. That's also when you [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1280.28s)]
*  became governor. Can you tell me how you've seen this particular issue play out? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1290.28s)]
*  KAMALA HARRIS Yeah, you're right about the timing of it. I think that in the year before I took [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1297.48s)]
*  office, we'd seen the first influx of migrants into certain states. We're home to a significant [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1302.52s)]
*  Haitian diaspora here in Massachusetts. And so there were a number of Haitians coming into [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1310.44s)]
*  Massachusetts. This was something that I inherited. It was underway when I became governor, and it only [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1316.76s)]
*  grew during the first year or so of my administration. It goes back to something fundamental. We have not [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1323.88s)]
*  had comprehensive immigration reform in this country. We need it. I was so upset when Donald Trump [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1333.0800000000002s)]
*  killed that border bill, which would have provided a pathway for our dreamers, would have provided a [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1339.4s)]
*  pathway for people who are living here, working here, raising kids here, paying taxes here to become [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1345.0s)]
*  citizens. It also would have provided the kinds of resources for more border agents, more immigration [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1351.48s)]
*  judges, more resources at intercepting fentanyl and other drugs from coming into the country. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1360.1200000000001s)]
*  It's been a challenging situation, to say the least. And my frustration has been, as a state governor, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1368.2s)]
*  I am inheriting the problems caused by federal inaction and federal inaction specifically [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1374.36s)]
*  on the border and on immigration. One of the most visible strategies Republican governors adopted [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1381.56s)]
*  during the height of the migrant crisis was sending buses and planes of migrants to blue states like [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1388.12s)]
*  yours. Very memorably, Martha's Vineyard, it was a stunt, but you could argue that it worked. It made [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1393.32s)]
*  immigration enforcement into a blue state issue, which it had not been. Shouldn't it always have [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1402.76s)]
*  been, though? I mean, is it not fair to say that Democrats really did not take this issue seriously? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1409.56s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I don't see it that way. I think Democrats in Congress were the ones who, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1417.8s)]
*  time after time, were pushing for immigration reform. And that's what I saw. It was a stunt. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1423.0s)]
*  It was a stunt what happened. I think it, you know, the buses, the buses to New York, to Illinois, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1429.24s)]
*  to Colorado, I think the Republicans did a really effective job of making this an issue and frankly, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1435.88s)]
*  of scaring a lot of people. Massachusetts ranked the safest state in the country, okay? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1443.3200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we don't have ongoing law enforcement work. We do, and that's the reason [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1450.52s)]
*  why it is so safe. We just had a takedown of a gang here a week or two ago, including a gang that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1455.0s)]
*  has recently been cited by the new ICE director. So, you know, it's also the case like here, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1465.08s)]
*  you know, with the migrants who came in. And by the way, they were fleeing the worst conditions [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1471.72s)]
*  imaginable, right? I saw them. I met with many of them. We got them work authorizations. They're [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1476.68s)]
*  working. They're paying taxes. These are all people with lawful status now. Their kids are [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1483.8s)]
*  going to school. They're contributing to our economy. They're working in our hospitals and [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1488.9199999999998s)]
*  nursing homes. That's what I chose to do. Ron DeSantis chose to put people on a plane and use [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1492.12s)]
*  them. Greg Abbott chose to put people on buses and use them to make a point. I'll tell you the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1497.6399999999999s)]
*  difference of being a Democratic governor. We actually found a way to take care of these people, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1502.36s)]
*  get them jobs, get them working, and get them contributing to our economies. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1506.44s)]
*  And yet a poll just came out from UMass and WCBV showing that immigration [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1511.48s)]
*  is very important to people here and a majority of voters don't approve of the way that you've [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1518.52s)]
*  handled it. Why do you think that is? There's just a lack of trust. There's a lack of trust. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1523.08s)]
*  And you know, it's hard to overcome the fear mongering that's gone on. The number of people [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1530.2s)]
*  in our emergency shelter system here in Massachusetts now. To zoom out, we're the only [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1536.12s)]
*  state in the country that has what's called a right to shelter law that houses women and children [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1541.48s)]
*  and families who are experiencing homelessness. And as a result, the law has required us to take in [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1546.92s)]
*  numbers, including migrants who've arrived here as homeless. I've recently made proposals to the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1554.52s)]
*  legislature to change that, but it's been a challenging situation. I'll say though, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1560.44s)]
*  that even within that system, the majority of folks in that system are actually Massachusetts [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1565.88s)]
*  families. They're not new immigrant families, okay? But it's about what the public perception [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1576.04s)]
*  is. And all I can do is try to manage my way through it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1583.0s)]
*  You've said before that the right to shelter law wasn't actually made to help waves and waves of [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1589.8799999999999s)]
*  people sort of settle here. And you are now seeking to change it. I am curious, why did you [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1599.16s)]
*  come to that decision? Because I think what you're trying to do, among other things, is require [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1604.52s)]
*  anyone seeking shelter to prove that they're in the country legally. Is that one of the changes [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1610.76s)]
*  that you're trying to make to the law? I think that what we're focused on is really about [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1614.28s)]
*  have you been living in Massachusetts or did you just get evicted from your apartment in [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1623.72s)]
*  Pennsylvania and you got on a bus and drove up here? Our law is meant to actually take of [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1628.6s)]
*  families who, for one reason or another, in Massachusetts became homeless. Not to be a [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1634.2s)]
*  refuge for people from other states who sadly and with compassion, I say this, became homeless [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1639.32s)]
*  and then come to Massachusetts to get housing. That's not the point of the law. As you know, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1646.2s)]
*  Trump supporters are Tom Homan singled Boston out at CPAC last week. He called out Boston's [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1651.3999999999999s)]
*  police commissioner who said because of state law, he won't be enforcing immigration orders [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1657.8799999999999s)]
*  against migrants. Homan then said, and I'm quoting here, I'm coming to Boston and bringing hell with [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  me. I'm wondering what your response to that is? First of all, I don't really even know what he's [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1668.68s)]
*  talking about, to be honest. Again, I'm somebody whose state police regularly work with Homeland [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1676.68s)]
*  Security, ATF, FBI, DEA on the investigation and prosecution of folks, including folks who are [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1683.72s)]
*  undocumented, who are committing crimes, drug trafficking, gun trafficking, human trafficking. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1691.3200000000002s)]
*  That was the way before Trump. It will be the way after Trump. So I don't really know what he's [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1697.64s)]
*  referring to in terms of why he singled out Boston. Again, Boston is- I think your police [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1704.04s)]
*  commissioner said basically that they weren't going to help ICE remove people with orders of [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1709.48s)]
*  removal, as happens in many sanctuary cities. We're not. Boston's, that's the thing. I think [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1717.8s)]
*  there's a lot of talk and semantics out there and this guy, Homan, is just, as a lot in the Trump [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1725.08s)]
*  administration do, just making up a bunch of stuff and trying to start something, trying to pick a [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1731.08s)]
*  fight. Look, that's not productive because as a former law enforcement official, if you care about [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  law enforcement, the best way to secure the safety and wellbeing of community states, our nation, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1742.04s)]
*  is for local, state, and federal law enforcement to work together. So it seems to me you shouldn't [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1748.28s)]
*  be threatening to bring, what was it? Hell? Yeah. Okay, whatever. No, you should come here with [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1753.88s)]
*  support and resources to help us address any public safety issues we're experiencing. You [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1760.2800000000002s)]
*  should do that with other states. And I can tell you that Massachusetts law enforcement, state and [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1767.0s)]
*  local, continue to work with federal law enforcement when it comes to the investigation and the [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1772.92s)]
*  prosecution and the apprehension of criminals. The real thing that's going on at ICE is that the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1778.76s)]
*  numbers have gone down at the border. The number, the crossings at the border were going down during [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1784.6s)]
*  the end of the Biden administration, in fact. And so I think they're scrambling to figure out how [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1789.64s)]
*  they can keep this going. Wasn't there reports just today of the number of National Guard people [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1794.44s)]
*  on the border sitting around doing nothing? I mean, let's put people to work. We've got governors [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  who are dealing with severe floods, severe fires. There's plenty of places that we need [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1808.04s)]
*  federal resources and help as states. As states. Would you meet Tom Homan if he came? Of course I [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1815.8s)]
*  would. Yeah, it sounds like I might need to explain a few things to him as somebody who investigated [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1821.8799999999999s)]
*  and prosecuted crimes, including with federal authorities for a number of years here. Maybe [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1826.84s)]
*  he doesn't have the benefit of that knowledge. Another place where the federal and state governments [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  are linked is on education. President Trump has made rolling back DEI, which is diversity, equity [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1838.52s)]
*  and inclusion, central to his political project. He has said now that he's going to be cutting [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1847.56s)]
*  federal funding for schools that include it. We don't know exactly what that means. It's sort of [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1852.84s)]
*  open to interpretation. You've said that Massachusetts schools are going to stay true to themselves. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1858.68s)]
*  What do you mean by that? We're going to keep doing what we're doing. Look, I am the first woman [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1865.16s)]
*  in Massachusetts history to be elected governor. I happened to be the first gay person elected [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1872.76s)]
*  governor. I don't know where I would be if I didn't have support and legal protections against [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1879.64s)]
*  discrimination my entire life. I was born in 1971, so just around the time of Title IX. I had a [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1888.92s)]
*  career as an athlete and a professional athlete basketball player before I went to law school. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1898.2s)]
*  I think about all that was made possible for me as a woman because there were state and federal [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1903.88s)]
*  laws in place that said, you know what, we should treat everybody fairly. Doesn't matter your gender, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1911.4s)]
*  doesn't matter the color of your skin, your religion. I think that's an American principle. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1917.72s)]
*  I'm not giving up on that. Even if it means pulling federal funding? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1924.76s)]
*  I just think enough people need to continue to speak out and speak to why that's such a bad thing. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1931.32s)]
*  Talk to any CEO, major Fortune 500 company. They'll tell you that their bottom line, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1938.28s)]
*  dollar-wise, does better when there's more diversity in the room. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1946.6000000000001s)]
*  But many of these... [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1950.92s)]
*  That's not a bad thing. It's a good thing. It's made us stronger. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1951.64s)]
*  Many of these companies that were ditching their DEI programs... [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1953.72s)]
*  And I don't know why. I don't know why. I mean, I think I know why. I think that they [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1956.76s)]
*  feel the threat of Elon Musk. They feel the threat of Donald Trump, which is sort of one in the same. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1962.8400000000001s)]
*  But I think that that's what they're responding to. It's not right. It's not a winner for this [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1975.24s)]
*  country. It's not going to help us be more competitive around the world by removing or [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1981.32s)]
*  doing things that hinder talent in this country and the success of individuals. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1990.76s)]
*  Why do you think we're seeing such a backlash to DEI, though? People have expressed that they do [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=1996.76s)]
*  feel that sort of mandated diversity, equity, and inclusion, they feel that it hasn't been [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2001.32s)]
*  beneficial to relations between races and ethnicities, and that there is a feeling [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2010.9199999999998s)]
*  specifically on the right that this has become a sort of left-wing orthodoxy. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2018.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting at a time when the co-president, Elon Musk, is giving us [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2022.36s)]
*  Hitler salutes and espousing anti-Semitic things. And I just find it ironic that we're going to have [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2034.28s)]
*  this debate over DEI and whether it's effective. All the while, this is going on over here. I mean, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2045.32s)]
*  seriously? Okay. So we can talk about DEI and whether there are some approaches or aspects that [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2051.4s)]
*  people want to look at more, maybe need reform, or there should be more flexibility in certain [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2056.84s)]
*  things. But do not tell me that we are going to condone and go down a path in government or in [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2061.56s)]
*  corporate America that says women and people of color are no longer at the table, and not only no [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2068.44s)]
*  longer at the table, but will not be supported anywhere along the way. I think unfortunately [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2075.88s)]
*  what's happened in the moment, we've seen a lot of capitulation. We've seen a lot of people trying [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2081.0s)]
*  to hedge their bets. You mean to tell me that's good for America? Come on. You were, as you [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2085.4s)]
*  mentioned, the country's first openly gay attorney general. Prior to that, you worked in the Civil [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2091.4s)]
*  Rights Division of the AG's office, where you led the first successful challenge to the Defense of [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2097.08s)]
*  Marriage Act. I sued President Obama. You did? There is some concern among Democrats that after [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2101.64s)]
*  Roe v. Wade, we are going to see Obergefell, the Supreme Court's decision that made gay marriage [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2112.2s)]
*  legal at the federal level, overturned next. Do you worry about that? I do. I mean, how can you [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2118.6s)]
*  not? The Supreme Court constituted as it is. I mean, how can you not? It seems like anything is [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2126.52s)]
*  possible, is conceivable. Now, it is again up to everyone to be able to speak out and articulate [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2134.12s)]
*  why it is so important to hold on to precedent. I thought we'd done that with Roe, right? And look [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2140.52s)]
*  at what happened there. And there was a huge amount of fury after Roe fell, but that dissipated. A lot [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2148.52s)]
*  of Democrats thought in this election that Roe was going to be something that was going to galvanize [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2155.16s)]
*  people, and it didn't enough. And so I guess when you look at marriage equality, does it seem more [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2160.04s)]
*  imminent to you that perhaps people won't stand up for the things that seem to have been settled? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2168.44s)]
*  I guess I'd unpack that a little bit. I think if you look at Roe in the aftermath of Roe, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2175.56s)]
*  what did I do right away as governor? Stockpile Mifepristone, right? We passed a shield law here [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2181.32s)]
*  to protect patients and providers. Other governors took similar actions. We saw races in states [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2186.6800000000003s)]
*  over Roe, over the abortion issue, where abortion rights won time after time after time, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2194.36s)]
*  where it didn't carry the day or carry the entirety of an election, determinative of an election, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2202.84s)]
*  the only one was the presidential. And I just think that abortion rights wasn't enough [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2210.04s)]
*  to overcome the perception of weak leadership by the Biden administration on immigration, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2217.8s)]
*  on the economy, and a poor job communicating what had actually been delivered for American people. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2226.36s)]
*  And also it was in the context of increasing inflation and high costs and a perception that [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2231.96s)]
*  the Democratic candidate wasn't empathizing enough and feeling the pain and delivering up [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2243.4s)]
*  a solution saying X, Y, and Z, I'm going to deliver for you. Now, meanwhile, Donald Trump [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2249.2400000000002s)]
*  said all these things that he was going to do to lower costs and prices and of course hasn't done [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2253.88s)]
*  a thing, nor is he going to. But I don't think there was a dissipation in the after-effect of [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2258.36s)]
*  Roe. I think it's there, it's strong. I think it did contribute to more people coming out, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2266.92s)]
*  even in the presidential. And I think the results in other races have shown that what's consistent [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2272.52s)]
*  with the polling, which is the vast majority of Americans, Democrat and Republican, support [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2280.76s)]
*  abortion rights. As to marriage equality, we'll see. It's something that I think has been, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2286.28s)]
*  at least in Massachusetts, we've had marriage equality for 20 years now. Many states have had [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2294.76s)]
*  it for some time as well. And the idea that a court overnight would take away that right take away, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2301.4s)]
*  remember, these are state marriage licenses, these aren't federal marriage licenses, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2311.4s)]
*  which is why I wanted the case to begin with, the DOMA case. It shouldn't happen as a matter of law, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2315.32s)]
*  but imagine the destruction to families, right? So I hope that doesn't happen. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2322.1200000000003s)]
*  Were you surprised to see the level of importance that trans rights had in this election? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2327.88s)]
*  And do you think Democrats misread the electorate on the issue, as Seth Moulton, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2332.76s)]
*  the representative from your own state, said? To me, it's just so sad that we are talking about [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2337.7200000000003s)]
*  such an infinitesimal portion of the population. But Trump and the Republicans intentionally [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2344.52s)]
*  made that into a mountain, right? We're talking about such a small sliver of the population. By [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2354.44s)]
*  the way, on athletics, it's even smaller as a percentage, but they did an incredibly [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2363.08s)]
*  effective job of making that an issue. That and immigration, I think were two of the issues. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2369.56s)]
*  What I keep on hearing you say is that they've managed to get the upper hand. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2377.72s)]
*  Well, I think the other thing was the economy. I mean, at the end of the day, I think it's the [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2380.2799999999997s)]
*  economy that ended up doing Biden and Kamala Harris. And last question, barring change to [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2384.2799999999997s)]
*  the Constitution, President Trump can't be reelected. But that's a real thing there, right? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2392.2s)]
*  Aren't people talking about it? He's got a group talking about a third term. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2396.6s)]
*  Are you worried about that? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2400.36s)]
*  I am worried about that. You have to think about it. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2405.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I have a pretty sober view of the situation. I mean, we live through Trump 1. We're [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2409.3199999999997s)]
*  on to Trump 2. I was talking to a historian the other day who I called on President's Day [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2415.16s)]
*  to ask for some guidance to help me provide a context for this moment that we're in. And [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2422.68s)]
*  she said to me, I can't. We've never seen anything like this before in American history. So [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2429.48s)]
*  you asked me that question and my genuine answer is, yeah, I'm worried about that. I'm worried [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2434.8399999999997s)]
*  about what they're doing in terms of looking to undermine future elections. Look at what [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2442.3599999999997s)]
*  Trump is proposing with the Postal Service and wanting to take it over, wanting to privatize it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2449.7999999999997s)]
*  The other day in the governor's meeting, he told us all we should be working by paper ballot. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2455.48s)]
*  And there's a reason they are doing that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2460.7599999999998s)]
*  When I speak to Democratic voters, there is an enormous amount of anger towards the Democratic [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2465.48s)]
*  Party that allowed this to happen. They look at this and they say it was the failure of the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2471.08s)]
*  Democratic Party that opened the door to Donald Trump coming in. And I just wonder, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2478.36s)]
*  as a sitting governor and a Democrat, how you respond to that. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2485.7200000000003s)]
*  I agree. I empathize with that position. Now, is it all attributable to one [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2491.96s)]
*  president and his team and his administration in the form of Joe Biden? No, I'm not suggesting that. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2500.36s)]
*  But there are things that happened that could have happened, that should have happened, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2507.4s)]
*  that didn't happen. And here we are. So I do this job. I became governor because I care about people. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2511.2400000000002s)]
*  I want to serve people. I want to see the people of Massachusetts served. My colleagues I work with [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2518.92s)]
*  and have the privilege of working with, the Democratic governors, believe in America, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2524.84s)]
*  believe in the needs, the wants of everyday Americans. So it's upsetting to be here, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2530.84s)]
*  having this conversation with you in this moment. And I too ask, how the hell did we get here? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2538.76s)]
*  Governor Healy, thank you very much. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2545.4s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_u5ipNlK30&t=2546.92s)]
