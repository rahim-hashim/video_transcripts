# K-Pop Trained Rosé to Be ‘a Perfect Girl.’ Now She’s Trying to Be Herself.
**New York Times - The Interview:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview and Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'd like to invite you into my refuge when it all gets to be too much. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=9.72s)]
*  It's a world of bright color, incredible fashion, perfectly choreographed dance moves, and ebullient [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=14.08s)]
*  earworms that bop. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=20.32s)]
*  Yep, I'm talking about K-pop. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=22.04s)]
*  If you know, you know. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=25.52s)]
*  But for those who don't, South Korean pop, known as K-pop, is a highly stylized art form [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=27.36s)]
*  that has a massive global fan base, giving outsized cultural influence to the small country [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=32.92s)]
*  where it's made. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=37.92s)]
*  The genre stars, known as idols, are trained, often for years, by entertainment companies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=39.8s)]
*  The companies then place the most promising trainees in groups, write and produce their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=45.46s)]
*  music, and, some would say, obsessively manage their public image. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=49.44s)]
*  It's a structure that works for the idols who make it big, but it also draws criticism [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=53.6s)]
*  for its grueling and what some critics call exploitative methods. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=58.28s)]
*  One of the biggest stars to come out of that system is Rosé. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=62.84s)]
*  Born Roseanne Park, she trained for years at one of K-pop's largest agencies, YG Entertainment, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=65.84s)]
*  eventually breaking through as part of the girl group, BLACKPINK. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=72.04s)]
*  Now she's striking out on her own with her first full-length solo album called Rosie. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=75.44s)]
*  The lead single, Apaté, is a collaboration with Bruno Mars and has made history as the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=80.4s)]
*  first track by a female K-pop artist to break into the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=85.28s)]
*  So Rosé's star keeps rising. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=92.16s)]
*  Still, she told me writing her own songs has made her think about where she came from and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=94.4s)]
*  who she is, apart from the system that made her into a global phenomenon. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=99.44s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Rosé. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=105.0s)]
*  Hi, how are you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=110.36s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=114.08s)]
*  I'm Rosé. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=118.84s)]
*  Hi, Rosé. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=119.84s)]
*  Is that how you prefer to be addressed or Rosé? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=120.84s)]
*  What would you like? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=124.08s)]
*  You can call me Rosé. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=125.08s)]
*  Actually, it's just become a habit lately. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=127.08s)]
*  I usually always introduce myself as Rosé, but like you can call me Rosé, Rosé, whatever [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=130.44s)]
*  you feel comfortable with. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=134.56s)]
*  Is there a difference between the two when you think of yourself as Rosé and when you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=135.96s)]
*  think of yourself as Rosé? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=140.08s)]
*  Yes, I think there's a bit of a difference, but it's more like if Rosé was a character [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=142.28s)]
*  that I really worked hard on as a trainee and it's a part of Blackpink and I feel like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Rosé is whatever is behind that and what came before that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=161.56s)]
*  I would say Rosé is definitely the character that my friends and family know. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  Rosé is more like I have music on and I like to be a diva and dance, but then Rosé would [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=173.72s)]
*  just be like me at home drowning in my bed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a huge moment for you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=190.12s)]
*  You're about to release your first solo album. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=192.88s)]
*  Can you tell me what are you feeling? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=195.72s)]
*  I feel like I've been waiting to release this album for my whole life, I would say. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=201.68s)]
*  Just growing up, I grew up listening to a lot of female artists and I used to relate [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=213.4s)]
*  to them a lot and used to really get me through a lot of tough times. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=219.12s)]
*  I would always dream of one day having an album myself, but I never really thought it [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=224.2s)]
*  would be realistic because once I started being in the industry, I started noticing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=229.88s)]
*  there was way more that goes into it than I expected. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=235.04s)]
*  I remember last year when I first begun the process of it, I doubted myself a lot. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  I feel like it feels like a dream that I'm about to release this album, but I kind of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=246.92s)]
*  lived in this album for the past year every single day and so I'm ready to be like, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  okay, get it out now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=257.28s)]
*  Time for me to move on as well from that chapter of my life. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=259.08s)]
*  You just talked about not having confidence in yourself to do this, which I think probably [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=262.92s)]
*  would be incredibly surprising to anyone who would look at Rosé with all your success, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=268.32s)]
*  with the enormous fan base that you have, to know that you doubted yourself so much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=275.28s)]
*  I was more afraid of… [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=281.8s)]
*  Because I don't think I ever learned or trained myself to be vulnerable and open and honest, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=285.6s)]
*  so that was the part I think I feared because it was the opposite of what I was trained [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=294.8s)]
*  to do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=299.56s)]
*  I really hoped that this album would be exactly that, to be vulnerable and very honest and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  something that just anyone could relate to. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=309.52s)]
*  Yeah, and so that was the part I think I feared. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=313.52s)]
*  I think that's the perfect opening to talk about how you got to where you are today. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  You were born in New Zealand to South Korean immigrant parents and then you moved to Australia [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=324.96s)]
*  when you were eight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=331.68s)]
*  When did you start playing music? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=333.2s)]
*  When I was growing up in Australia, there's really not much to do there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=336.6s)]
*  It's not like Seoul City or New York. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=340.12s)]
*  It was just school and back home. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=342.6s)]
*  School and then back home. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=345.32s)]
*  I'd be really bored. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=346.32s)]
*  My parents had made me take piano lessons, so I knew how to play a few chords. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=349.0s)]
*  I'd end up just printing chords on paper and then I'd sing along to it because it was [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=355.36s)]
*  a form of entertainment, basically. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=361.04s)]
*  I picked up the guitar because that's when YouTube started blowing up and all these people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  would cover songs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  I think that's so cool. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=371.36s)]
*  I want to be that girl who knows how to play the guitar and sings. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  So I picked up the guitar and I practiced that at home. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  It was really organic. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=382.16s)]
*  It was a form of entertainment for me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=383.16s)]
*  So in 2012 when you were 15, you auditioned for a slot in YG Entertainment's trainee program, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  which is basically a boarding school, if you will, for becoming a K-pop star. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=392.8s)]
*  It was your dad's idea, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=398.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=400.64s)]
*  What was it that made your dad want you to audition and did you understand what you were [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=401.64s)]
*  getting into? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=407.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=408.24s)]
*  That's when I was watching YouTube a lot. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=409.24s)]
*  If you would search K-pop, there'd be this whole world in Korea where there are trainees [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=414.92s)]
*  and they all train and become K-pop stars. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=421.88000000000005s)]
*  So that was kind of like, there's this fantasy about it, obviously. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=424.16s)]
*  I think I would sometimes dream and I'd be like, imagine myself actually doing that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=428.16s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, that's ridiculous. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  It'd never happen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  But that would be so cool. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  But it wasn't much of a possibility in my head until my dad saw that YG was flying to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  Australia. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=444.56s)]
*  Back then, it was very rare that Korean companies would come all the way to Australia. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=445.56s)]
*  My dad was like, Rosie, you sing every night until past midnight and we have to drag you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=451.0s)]
*  back into the room. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=457.28s)]
*  You obviously like to do this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=458.92s)]
*  You should take the audition. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=460.4s)]
*  I was like, me? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=461.4s)]
*  I really thought he was joking. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=462.92s)]
*  I'm like, I don't even know how to sing properly. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=464.4s)]
*  And he was like, well, you just got to do it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=468.0s)]
*  And if it doesn't work out, then it was a fun experience. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=470.96s)]
*  But you don't want to be 26 and regret that you never tried it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=473.84s)]
*  And I was like, oh, OK. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  So we flew to Sydney and I took the audition and I was already like, everyone's so good. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=482.32s)]
*  And I remember being like, OK, that was fun. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  Bye. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=490.12s)]
*  But to my surprise, they called us back and then they asked us to pack up our bags and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=491.12s)]
*  come to Korea in two months. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=498.0s)]
*  And so that's what happened. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=499.72s)]
*  I mean, you know, becoming a trainee is full time. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=502.8s)]
*  It's based in Seoul. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=507.88s)]
*  You had to pack up your life and leave in two months. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=508.88s)]
*  It isn't something it seems that you enter lightly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, what were the conversations like in your family when you were deciding whether [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=514.56s)]
*  to stay or go? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=519.0s)]
*  My mom was very against it at the beginning because obviously she worries about a lot [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=521.16s)]
*  of things, which she should. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=525.6s)]
*  And it was like nothing was promised really. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=527.68s)]
*  But my dad won. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=532.0s)]
*  I think I was too young to really think about everything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=534.0400000000001s)]
*  I was more excited. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=537.88s)]
*  I didn't even think I knew that I was going to be living in a dorm with the girls. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  I didn't understand the fact that I'd be apart from my family. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  I just thought I'd be going and, oh, I'm in a dorm. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=547.0s)]
*  Yay. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=549.64s)]
*  And then I remember when I got there, my parents were like, OK, we're going now. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=550.64s)]
*  We're leaving. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=554.08s)]
*  And I was like, where are you going? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=555.08s)]
*  And they're like, we have to go now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  We have to fly back. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  And I remember freaking out. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's when it hit me. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  This is very real. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=562.2s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy, though, to just sort of arrive there and not realize that that's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=565.88s)]
*  where you're going to be living and staying there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=569.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=572.44s)]
*  Did you know much about the Korean idol culture at that point? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=573.32s)]
*  I did, because that's again, when YouTube started blowing up and they were releasing [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=577.12s)]
*  a lot of content in Korea about the trainee life. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=583.24s)]
*  And it was a bit glamorized, sure. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=586.6s)]
*  It looked really like everyone was chasing their dreams and working so hard. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=589.72s)]
*  And I think I didn't understand the lonely part, like the loneliness that I would have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=595.08s)]
*  to go through. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=600.4s)]
*  That was a bit traumatizing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=601.4s)]
*  I mean, a bit shocking. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=603.12s)]
*  But, you know, I survived it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=604.64s)]
*  I think a lot of people outside of Korea don't quite understand how intense the process is [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=610.4s)]
*  to become an idol. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=615.28s)]
*  What was a typical day like for you? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=617.8s)]
*  So for us, the schedule was like we would wake up at... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=621.4s)]
*  I had to wake up at like 9.30, I remember, because I needed to take a shower. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=626.64s)]
*  And then we'd be at our dance hall that we all shared between us, seven to eight girls. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=630.76s)]
*  And we'd have like vocal lessons and dance lessons and language lessons all set up. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=637.72s)]
*  And then practice would end at 2 a.m. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=644.16s)]
*  But for me, I used to want the hall to myself. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  So there were many days when you'd just stay back and use the hall after hours. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=650.24s)]
*  And then it would repeat like that every single day. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=656.2s)]
*  You were clearly very driven to want to make this work. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=659.76s)]
*  I think a big part of that was because I had traveled so far for it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=663.48s)]
*  For me, if I failed here, then I would have to fly all the way back to Australia. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=667.6s)]
*  And all my friends who asked me, where are you going? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=672.32s)]
*  I don't understand what you're doing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=674.92s)]
*  I didn't want to have to explain to them this whole process of me, you know, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=676.88s)]
*  failing and flying back. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=681.76s)]
*  And so I could not let that happen. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  And it drove me to be more determined. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=684.88s)]
*  I mean, it says something about you that you had so much discipline and so much drive [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  that you wanted to sort of get to a place. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=692.5999999999999s)]
*  I think I learned that about myself when I got to YG. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't something that I had before. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=700.5999999999999s)]
*  And that got me there was more like I got there and then I was put in that situation. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=703.08s)]
*  And that's when I learned so much about myself. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  And I'm very, yeah, very like determined. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=709.72s)]
*  And that's when I learned. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=715.24s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is the type of person I am. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=717.24s)]
*  I read you'd get only one day off every two weeks. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=720.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  What did you do on your on your day off? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  Lisa is from Thailand as well. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=729.2s)]
*  So Lisa and I didn't have friends or family there. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=730.84s)]
*  So we would. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=733.48s)]
*  Another member of Blackpink? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=734.48s)]
*  Yes, another Blackpink. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=735.64s)]
*  We were in the same room. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=737.76s)]
*  And so we'd wake up and I'd be like, I'm going to church. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=739.12s)]
*  And so I'd meet her after church and then we'd go shopping and go to our favorite stores. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=742.32s)]
*  Remember this place called Myeongdong back then. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=747.88s)]
*  We don't go there anymore, but we'd go to Myeongdong and like go shopping. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=751.32s)]
*  And then I remember we'd always pass like Jordans was like a big thing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=756.08s)]
*  The sneakers, Nike Jordans, I remember. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=760.88s)]
*  And like it was like such a big hype back then, but it was so expensive. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=763.88s)]
*  So we'd always go to the store and like look at all the shoes and be like, oh, it's so pretty. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, this is so expensive. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  I really want these. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=776.04s)]
*  And we wouldn't be able to buy it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=776.88s)]
*  So I feel like maybe next time. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=778.64s)]
*  And we would actually go shopping for the things that we had to wear for training. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=780.88s)]
*  For like for training, we'd have to do these like weekly and like monthly tests. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=786.2800000000001s)]
*  And so for that, we need to look good. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=791.4000000000001s)]
*  And so we'd have to style ourselves. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=793.0s)]
*  But like, you know, we didn't know much about clothes and, you know, with the money that my parents would send us, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=795.1600000000001s)]
*  we'd like go out and like try to look good. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=801.5200000000001s)]
*  And so it was like a constant, you know, battle of proving to the company that this is who we are. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  This is the artist that I can be. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=810.2s)]
*  This is the artist I am. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=811.72s)]
*  And to be an artist is like fashion is a big part of it and how we present ourselves as an artist. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=812.88s)]
*  And so like we worked really hard on that. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=818.28s)]
*  The idea here is that they're training you to be this huge star. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=821.76s)]
*  So in addition to singing and dancing, did you get instruction on like the public facing aspects of the job? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=825.12s)]
*  Did they try to prepare you for what fame might be like? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=831.48s)]
*  No, not necessarily. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=834.84s)]
*  I personally think that especially us four, like Blackpink, we're very, we're all smart enough to be to navigate our way through. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=837.68s)]
*  And we're all very responsible. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=846.12s)]
*  And so I'm guessing that's why, you know, we got selected. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=848.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I just believe that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's not like they like told us anything specific. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=852.92s)]
*  Like, this is what you're going to be going through mentally, et cetera. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  It was like, yeah, it was more organic than that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=859.2399999999999s)]
*  I think if that was all taught as well, it seems a bit weird. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=861.9599999999999s)]
*  It seems very, very planned. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=864.84s)]
*  But we were there for music. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  And so we just worked on music. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=868.4s)]
*  Well, you were at the Academy for four years. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=870.32s)]
*  Some of the people who train there are trained for six or seven years. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=872.44s)]
*  Does it seem like a good system? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=876.72s)]
*  Well, me personally, I still talk about it sometimes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=879.0s)]
*  And I say, I'm like talking to my producer and I say, I really miss the days where I was given all the time in the world to work on my music. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=882.64s)]
*  And I said, at the time, it was like endless hours. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=895.3599999999999s)]
*  And sometimes I was hopeful. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=899.76s)]
*  Sometimes it felt like, felt hopeless. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=901.28s)]
*  But I think deep down inside, I really enjoyed it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=904.56s)]
*  Being able to live in that with all the time. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=908.3599999999999s)]
*  Like, I think that was like a really special moment that I'm never probably going to be able to get back to just solely do that. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=911.92s)]
*  And I tell, I say, I'm like, when I look at trainees and the girls that are coming up, I really think, I envy that kind of. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=921.5999999999999s)]
*  Because even though it was mentally challenging, I think the trainee days of me pushing through all those hardships has helped me do these things for myself even to this day. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=931.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it sounds like a lot to navigate. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=944.36s)]
*  What was it like when all of a sudden Blackpink comes out and it just becomes an immediate success? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  What was the transition like from being a trainee with all the time in the world to do your music to suddenly becoming an actual pop star? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=955.72s)]
*  I think that might have been the hard, maybe the hardest part for me. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=966.0s)]
*  Because I think being a trainee, yes, settling into this whole new world with people you don't know, that is challenging. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=972.56s)]
*  But it was still off camera and I got to make mistakes. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=979.5999999999999s)]
*  But I feel like the transition of now having to be on camera and being an artist and presenting to the world who I am, that's something we just had to learn as we went. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=984.4s)]
*  So I think the first few years was very difficult for me personally. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=997.0s)]
*  But a few years in, I started picking it up and learning. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1002.48s)]
*  What was hard about it? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1008.32s)]
*  I think it's still hard actually. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1009.9200000000001s)]
*  And it kind of never stopped since then. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1011.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what I'm hearing is that you had to find out who you were in the glare of this very big spotlight. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1014.6s)]
*  And one of the things that is unique about K-pop is that the fan culture is so specific and so enormous. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1023.08s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about that relationship? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1033.24s)]
*  I mean, how authentic did you feel like you could be? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1036.28s)]
*  How authentic did you want to be? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1040.2s)]
*  I mean, I felt like we were trained to always present ourselves in the most perfect way. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1043.96s)]
*  And so even when we were interacting with them online, it was when I was ready to give perfect answers and give people what they wanted. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1052.36s)]
*  And making sure that I'm a perfect girl for everyone. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1061.76s)]
*  And so I think that was the culture. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1067.4799999999998s)]
*  And then that's why leading into this album, it was a little bit of a personal want and need to be able to write an album that I grew up with. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1069.9599999999998s)]
*  I had listened to music that I felt like I could relate to. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1081.96s)]
*  But in order for that, I'm sure artists had to be vulnerable. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1089.0s)]
*  But we hadn't trained to talk about our emotions and feelings and experiences. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  So it must have been scary to do this, because this is a very personal album. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1098.16s)]
*  Let's talk about Rosie. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1104.12s)]
*  When you had to sit down with yourself and write this album, what was that like to have to dig deep? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1106.9199999999998s)]
*  To be honest, like doing it, it was that was like breathing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1115.28s)]
*  All the stories in there are stories that, you know, anyone around me has heard more than 20 times. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1121.6799999999998s)]
*  It was about time I wrote it in a song. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  But it was like I had moments where I was like, wait, can we say this? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1131.84s)]
*  Wait, maybe we shouldn't put that word in there. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  Maybe this is too much. Should we not? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1138.12s)]
*  And then I think it was like the process of me letting that go. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1140.1599999999999s)]
*  What's the fear, though, when you're saying, I don't want to put that in there? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1144.72s)]
*  Like, I guess at first, like, I mean, I'm talking about very normal experiences. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1149.32s)]
*  That normal 20s, like you're all in their 20s is going through. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1155.0s)]
*  And so, like I said, there's a whole world and a whole life behind, you know, screen where I experience things that my fans hasn't really heard about or seen and talked about. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1157.92s)]
*  And so like sometimes it does scare me. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, can I show this side of me? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1175.96s)]
*  And am I allowed to talk about this? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not even like crazy things, to be honest. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1183.28s)]
*  It's very normal things. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1186.0s)]
*  So it sounds like I'm going to be talking about some crazy experiences. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1187.04s)]
*  It's not really that crazy. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1191.44s)]
*  It's very normal things. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1192.56s)]
*  No, the themes are heartache, lost love, anger sometimes at people. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1194.44s)]
*  I mean, the range of human emotions. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1201.92s)]
*  Yeah, romance. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1204.76s)]
*  But even that is like, it's scary for me. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1206.48s)]
*  So that was, yeah, it was like I could see like the faces in the producers and songwriters. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1209.52s)]
*  They were like, so interesting, Rosie. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  Why are you so nervous about this? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1218.16s)]
*  And I'm like, you guys, you don't know. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1219.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've seen reporting that, you know, K-pop agencies have strict rules when it comes to dating. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1223.76s)]
*  And in part, maybe because they want fans to feel like idols are in a relationship with them. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1231.2s)]
*  Is that part of the fear that it's not normal for stars to necessarily share that? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1236.24s)]
*  Well, yeah, it was not normal. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1243.68s)]
*  It isn't normal. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1246.48s)]
*  But also, it's just not normal for me, too. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1247.84s)]
*  Like I had never really spoken about it because I feel like there's no need for me to ever confirm anything or talk about it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1250.32s)]
*  But I think that's why like this album means a lot to me because it's just like these things are just inspirations for my art. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1257.68s)]
*  So I do want to make sure that that's like very well addressed. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1265.8400000000001s)]
*  The fact that it's not about the story of who Rosie has been with or whatever. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1270.96s)]
*  It's really more about the art. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1276.64s)]
*  And it's scary. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1278.24s)]
*  It's kind of unfair that I have to think about that part of it because really, again, it's just an element of inspiration. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1279.44s)]
*  I can hear you drawing a boundary, you know, that your personal life is your personal life, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1288.96s)]
*  which I totally respect. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1293.2s)]
*  I was really struck by one particular song off the album, which is called Number One Girl. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1296.48s)]
*  When I listened, it felt like it could be about a romantic relationship or about a relationship with fame and celebrity. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1302.24s)]
*  One of the lyrics goes, tell me I'm that new thing. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1308.4s)]
*  Tell me that I'm relevant. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1311.52s)]
*  Can you talk to me a little bit about that song? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that song was written after a terrible night of scrolling through the internet. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1316.4s)]
*  So like 6 a.m. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1322.96s)]
*  And I barely got any sleep. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1324.3999999999999s)]
*  I rocked up to the studio the next day, very cranky. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1325.9199999999998s)]
*  And they asked me, how have you been? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1328.72s)]
*  And I was like, very bad. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1330.48s)]
*  I'm so exhausted. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1332.96s)]
*  I'm exhausted trying to please everyone. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm always just trying my best to be my best version. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1337.6799999999998s)]
*  But I felt a little lost and felt like I was never good enough. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1340.6399999999999s)]
*  And I was a bit cranky, cranky against the world and just the universe. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1345.4399999999998s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I want to write a song that's just so disgustingly open and honest. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1351.04s)]
*  Like, you know, things that I hate myself for, like thinking. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1357.84s)]
*  I said, like, all those thoughts that's written in those lyrics are thoughts that I don't want to admit that I actually think. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1362.8s)]
*  Because I think I like to present myself as a very positive girl who's like, who just who doesn't think about negative things, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1368.64s)]
*  who's very just bright minded and whatnot. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1375.04s)]
*  But I think that was honestly the day I was like, no, I have these days. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1378.8s)]
*  What were you watching online? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1383.92s)]
*  What were you seeing? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that's like comments, you know, like just searching topics that were not going to necessarily satisfy me. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1387.2s)]
*  And I just like go down like rabbit holes of of negative comments and just I don't think I knew. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1396.72s)]
*  I didn't understand what I was searching for as well. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1404.56s)]
*  But I was looking for validation and and I felt like, wow, it was a lonely world that night in that on on the Internet, on social media. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1407.76s)]
*  It was a lonely world. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1418.48s)]
*  And and as I was writing the song, I felt there must be so many other girls who experienced this. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  And and so I just want people to know that I'm I'm no different. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1428.88s)]
*  What does Vampire Holly mean? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1433.76s)]
*  Because you've Vampire Holly was another day of those because you it's your new handle on Instagram and one of the songs on the album. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1436.24s)]
*  And I can't let you break me like this is one of the lines. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1445.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1448.48s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1449.28s)]
*  Yeah, Vampire Holly was my private Instagram account. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1451.28s)]
*  It was just an account that I made so that I didn't have to be like because my official account is like has a lot of followers. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1456.24s)]
*  And I always have to think about what people are going to think of me. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1463.52s)]
*  But I wanted an Instagram where I just felt just didn't have to be cool. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1465.52s)]
*  It's your Finsta. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1471.2s)]
*  It's my Finsta. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1472.88s)]
*  And it's what I just used. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1474.0s)]
*  And then I remember, you know, a few fans found out about the Instagram and then I think they started getting they would. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1476.16s)]
*  You know, there are certain people who want to be negative and they they were trying to find all the ways to get to me. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  And I guess they ended up getting to that account and then using that to like cause drama and and create actually trigger me. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  And they were it felt like obviously they were obsessed with the thought of like controlling me and you know that. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1503.92s)]
*  But then I felt like I was obsessed back. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1513.6s)]
*  But then I remember after I wrote that, I let it all go and I never went back to it again. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1516.32s)]
*  There is a big anti-fan movement in K-pop where there's a lot of bullying online, especially of female artists. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1522.08s)]
*  And it sounds like this was part of that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1529.9199999999998s)]
*  You were experiencing that. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1532.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1534.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1535.6s)]
*  I don't want to get emotional about it. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1536.32s)]
*  But it's OK. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1541.04s)]
*  I think like I didn't think that I would say I'm pretty strong minded as well. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1544.56s)]
*  I'm pretty like I'm not that like I'm very positive as well. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  And I like to be smart about, you know, how things affect me. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1556.56s)]
*  But I think I remember when it felt like it actually did get to me that like it felt pretty, pretty bad. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1561.1999999999998s)]
*  I was like, oh, my gosh, I am going through this. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1568.3999999999999s)]
*  I never I never thought I would. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1570.8799999999999s)]
*  I think I would see things online and I'd always think it's interesting. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1572.8s)]
*  It's just like, I wonder why they let that get to them, you know. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1576.24s)]
*  But I remember when it did, I was shocked. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1578.88s)]
*  I'm sorry that that happened to you. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1584.64s)]
*  And I know you've talked about your own mental health and how demanding it can feel to protect yourself from this stuff. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1587.76s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1598.72s)]
*  Well, in this case, now that I've found a songwriting, we'll write it in a song. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1602.96s)]
*  If life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1608.8s)]
*  I think that was the only thing. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1612.08s)]
*  It was kind of surprising because songwriting came to me as like a blessing at the moment. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1615.04s)]
*  I really needed it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1621.6s)]
*  And I was like, wow, I'd walk in with a big problem. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1622.64s)]
*  I'd store it in a song and it would leave my mind, it would leave my heart. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1626.72s)]
*  And so as cheesy as it sounds, the songwriting has helped me. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1634.96s)]
*  Like it actually like leaves my soul as I leave it in a song. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1640.48s)]
*  But then there are some days where I don't like the song and I'm like, that didn't help. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1644.88s)]
*  That didn't help. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1649.6000000000001s)]
*  That song's not going to be in the album. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1650.24s)]
*  I'm still suffering now. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1651.76s)]
*  So we better write. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  It's kind of it was actually like that. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1654.88s)]
*  I think I ended up, I was so addicted to songwriting at one point because I'd have [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1656.56s)]
*  these concepts that I wanted to write about and then we'd paint it, but it wouldn't be [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1660.96s)]
*  the right image. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1666.08s)]
*  And I'd be like, no, like, yeah, but that's not what I wanted to say. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1667.76s)]
*  Okay, scratch that again, again, again. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1672.24s)]
*  And then I'd get the song and I'd be like, yes. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1674.08s)]
*  And I'd actually heal from it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1676.24s)]
*  And I would never actually think about it again, because it literally just lives in that song. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1677.52s)]
*  And it actually heals me. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1682.3999999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1686.6399999999999s)]
*  After the break, I call Rosé back and she tells me about what's next for Blackpink [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1692.6399999999999s)]
*  as its four members pursue their solo careers. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1698.08s)]
*  I think we all have obviously love for Blackpink, but I think we were, I would say, mature enough [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1701.6799999999998s)]
*  to come to a conclusion that in order for us to continue this in a healthy way, we also [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1708.08s)]
*  have to acknowledge that we all have also individual needs and wants. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1713.92s)]
*  Hi. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1735.92s)]
*  Thanks for talking to me again. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1737.28s)]
*  I want to start by asking you about the idea of the seven-year curse in K-pop, which refers [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1740.32s)]
*  to the trend of groups disbanding around their seventh year together. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1746.32s)]
*  And that kind of coincides sometimes with record contracts expiring. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1750.8s)]
*  But Blackpink just resigned with YG Entertainment in 2023. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1755.6799999999998s)]
*  So, you know, you have all gone off and had solo projects. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1760.08s)]
*  Did you ever think about breaking up when you were going off to explore what the solo [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  experience was going to be? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1770.24s)]
*  It was definitely a moment of all of us sitting down and thinking about what we wanted individually, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1772.88s)]
*  all four of us, because, you know, it's a group of four, like we all have to make decisions [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1781.2s)]
*  on behalf of like what we really truly wanted. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  And so it wasn't like a quick decision. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1791.44s)]
*  I think it was over a course of like a few months. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1793.52s)]
*  Like we kind of started thinking about it in advance. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1796.24s)]
*  I think as we all like, you know, we communicated a lot and we just thought we, I think we all [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1800.24s)]
*  have obviously love for Blackpink and performing as Blackpink. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1805.92s)]
*  But I think we were, I would say mature enough to come to a conclusion that in order for us [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1809.8400000000001s)]
*  to continue this in a healthy way and maintain that passion in the long run, we also have [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1815.76s)]
*  to acknowledge that we all have also individual needs and wants. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1822.72s)]
*  And so we came to a healthy conclusion of, you know, making sure we all kind of got to [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1827.04s)]
*  do what we wanted to do for a good period of time and then get together. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1832.16s)]
*  So that's what's happening next year would be Blackpink's. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1836.48s)]
*  We would probably be releasing music and we're set for tour. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1839.92s)]
*  I do want to ask you another thing about the trainee system, because I heard you say that [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  for you, your time as a trainee was basically pretty positive. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1852.5600000000002s)]
*  You described it as a period where you really dedicated all your time to doing the thing [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1856.48s)]
*  that you loved. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1861.2s)]
*  But, you know, I've read a lot about how the system has been criticized in the culture [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1863.28s)]
*  and also legally as being exploitative, financially, maybe even emotionally. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1869.2s)]
*  There have been allegations of abuse. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1874.16s)]
*  And so I guess I was wondering, do you think that the system overall is a good way to help [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1876.64s)]
*  nurture young art and artists? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1881.76s)]
*  I personally, because I started so late, I started at 16. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1887.52s)]
*  This is just like a personal experience for me, but I had like a good system because we [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1893.2s)]
*  had like our producer Teddy and people looking out for us and taking care of us. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1898.72s)]
*  So I personally felt like it really helped me quickly pick up on, because I had shorter [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1904.64s)]
*  time than all the other girls and they really, they got me to train in such a short amount [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1911.04s)]
*  of time so I could be as good as the other girls. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1918.72s)]
*  And that's how I got my career and I get to do what I do today. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1921.3600000000001s)]
*  And so like for me, it's been a pretty good experience. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1926.32s)]
*  But it might have been harder if you'd had to do it longer or started younger? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1932.32s)]
*  I wouldn't know because I haven't. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1938.08s)]
*  I guess I'm wondering, would you recommend that a teenage girl take the same path that you did? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1941.44s)]
*  I think if you have the dream and the determination, then go for it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1946.08s)]
*  It was like exactly what my dad said. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1951.6s)]
*  I was like, me? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1953.2s)]
*  Like dad, I've never done like a vocal lesson in my life. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to do anything. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1957.52s)]
*  I don't know, never danced in my life. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1958.8s)]
*  And I'm like, I was 16 and so, but he was like, Rosie, if you love it, you try it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1960.64s)]
*  And if you don't want to regret it in 10 years, you better try it now. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1967.6s)]
*  And that was probably the best advice. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1972.0s)]
*  And I went there and I discovered my determination and that's what I had. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1975.44s)]
*  And I had the drive. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1980.96s)]
*  I remember my parents would be like, Rosie, just like, because it was hard. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1982.24s)]
*  It's not easy at all. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1986.8s)]
*  And I'd call crying and they'd be like, come home. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1988.08s)]
*  And that would be the last thing I'd want to hear. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1990.88s)]
*  I'd be like, no, we're going home is not an option. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to make this happen. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1996.08s)]
*  And we did it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1997.6s)]
*  We came out as Blackpink and I'm here today. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=1999.76s)]
*  So I think it was a great thing for me. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2002.16s)]
*  It was. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2006.72s)]
*  Do you think it changed who you were? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2008.48s)]
*  Everything that you went through at YG and this whole crazy journey that you've just described? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2009.92s)]
*  Not really. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2014.88s)]
*  I think who I am. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2016.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2019.92s)]
*  Like inside, I think if I talk to my mom and my sister and my dad, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2020.4s)]
*  I feel like this has always been me, like my personality. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2028.16s)]
*  It was just, I guess when I went to Korea, that's when it opened up. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2031.44s)]
*  And that's when I started to see, oh, this is me as a person. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2035.44s)]
*  Maybe it has, maybe it hasn't, but I don't know if that's something I can say. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2040.24s)]
*  I guess it's something we have to ask the people around me. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2044.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2047.68s)]
*  I don't know about myself, really. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2049.44s)]
*  I think that's why I asked a lot of my friends about, I was like, what do you think? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2051.12s)]
*  Was I too nervous? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2054.64s)]
*  Do you think I was this? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2055.6s)]
*  Do you think I was that? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2056.56s)]
*  I like to ask around. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a6WIX4TcOw&t=2058.2400000000002s)]
