# Al Pacino Is Still Going Big
**New York Times - The Interview:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=7.0s)]
*  When I was in college, I had a poster of Al Pacino in Scarface hanging up on my wall. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=9.0s)]
*  And I know that a Scarface poster is up there with Bob Marley and Dark Side of the Moon [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=16.32s)]
*  as far as cliched dorm room art goes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=20.96s)]
*  But I promise that my love for Pacino and that movie were real. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=23.84s)]
*  The sheer bravado he exuded as Tony Montana was irresistible. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=27.92s)]
*  Especially for me at a time in my life when bravado was, let's just say, not exactly my default mode. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=32.400000000000006s)]
*  Also, like a lot of people have that poster, I just thought it looked really cool. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=39.2s)]
*  I came to Pacino's work in kind of a backwards way. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  I fell in love with his acting when I was a teenager in the 90s. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=47.24s)]
*  And that's when he was regularly popping up in pretty mainstream movies like Scent of Woman and Heat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=50.36s)]
*  I didn't yet fully appreciate him as an icon of 1970s cinema, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=55.52s)]
*  who helps bring a new level of emotional intensity and realism to screen acting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  But those 70s roles are, of course, where Pacino made his name. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=64.64s)]
*  Think of the frazzled, yearning Sonny Wartzik in Dog Day Afternoon, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=68.56s)]
*  the tormented cop of Serpico, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=71.88s)]
*  and the morally compromised Michael Corleone from The Godfather movies. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=74.36s)]
*  These are roles that all shined a bright, empathetic light on what it is to live an emotionally conflicted life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  And that's not even mentioning his work in the theater, to which he's periodically returned over the years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=84.48s)]
*  His Shylock in Merchant of Venice is the single best stage performance I've ever seen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=89.28s)]
*  Over time, I've learned that there's an Al Pacino role that has resonated with every phase of my life. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=95.16s)]
*  And learning that has been one of the real pleasures of getting older. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Pacino himself is now 84, and he's finally written a memoir called Sonny Boy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=105.12s)]
*  And reading it, I realized that I didn't actually know that much about the man whose performances had moved me so much. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  So I wanted to talk to Al Pacino about anything and everything. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  His childhood, his approach to acting, how he thinks about money, the fact he almost died not that long ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  And I hope that understanding the person behind these characters would help me understand why he's meant so much to me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=124.64s)]
*  Here's my interview, very long awaited, with Al Pacino. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm David. I'm the schmuck who's going to be asking you questions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=134.52s)]
*  Oh, you're the writer? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=141.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=143.12s)]
*  Yes. Oh, yeah. I thought, I thought, that guy looks like a schmuck. He must be a writer. No, no, I didn't. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=143.72s)]
*  You know, I saw an interview with you just a couple of years ago where you mentioned that you'd been asked to write a book before. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=151.28s)]
*  And you didn't want to do it because you thought the prospect of it seemed kind of torturous, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  that it would be too difficult to go back through your life. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Here we are. You've written a book. What changed? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=166.28s)]
*  Nothing. I regret it. I regret it. What else can I say? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=170.72s)]
*  I have many regrets, but this would be one of them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=177.32s)]
*  Who needs to be out and about in this world, you know, putting yourself up as yet another day for another target? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=180.6s)]
*  I mean, waking up in the middle of the night having tremors, I mean, it's really scary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  You break out in a cold sweat and say, oh, my, I shouldn't have done this. I shouldn't have said this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=193.88s)]
*  You know, you say all those things. But I was telling the truth. That's all I know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=198.44s)]
*  So in the book, you write about this quote that's meaningful to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=204.56s)]
*  I think it's from one of the Flying Willendos, the famous daredevil family. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=208.6s)]
*  For people who don't know, share the quote. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=212.28s)]
*  The quote is, life is on the wire. The rest is just waiting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=215.4s)]
*  And so for you, acting is the wire. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=223.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=226.24s)]
*  That's the place where life is most vibrant and alive. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=227.0s)]
*  And the thing that I want to understand as a non-actor is why that is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=231.44s)]
*  You know, in acting, you get to rehearse, do another take if something doesn't go well. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  If you mess up, it's not the end of the world. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=242.48s)]
*  In real life, you don't get to rehearse. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=245.24s)]
*  You don't get new takes. And the consequences can be a lot scarier. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=247.84s)]
*  So why for you is acting where life happens? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=253.04s)]
*  Well, because somehow I felt as though my life was saved by acting, my existence, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=257.6s)]
*  because I knew that I could do something. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=267.0s)]
*  It was just like having been able to play the harmonica or something. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=270.76s)]
*  Or look at Buddy Rich, the drummer. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=276.56s)]
*  My God, I was at Carnegie Hall listening to him at a Frank Sinatra concert. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=281.4s)]
*  And he went on before Frank. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=287.4s)]
*  And the audience, I'm saying, oh, a drummer, we're going to hear a drummer. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=290.0s)]
*  I heard of him, but I said, I don't want to hear a drummer. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=293.0s)]
*  I want to have Frank. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  So I was sitting there, somebody, a drummer solo? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=297.44s)]
*  What can that be? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=299.84s)]
*  And it was one of those great moments in my life when I know it, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  because when he was finished and when he took his two sticks and then he got to the point, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=305.28s)]
*  he just left you with the silence. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=311.2s)]
*  And everyone in that house, I mean, everyone stood up and started screaming. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=313.96s)]
*  I felt myself screaming. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=320.76s)]
*  That's what he did because he did it his whole life. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=323.12s)]
*  So Sinatra comes out afterward and he looks at the crowd and he says, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  because he must have been about 65, Buddy Rich. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=330.8s)]
*  That was an older man doing that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  And so when Frank came out, he said, see what happens when you stay at a thing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=336.92s)]
*  And that thing was acting for you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=345.56s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=347.12s)]
*  Yeah. And Buddy Rich was the drums and Sinatra was singing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  And you see how that matters. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=354.04s)]
*  You have to have the desire. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=357.36s)]
*  You know, there's a great, I don't know if you've ever seen this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=361.68s)]
*  I'm going to go on a bit of a tangent. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=364.64s)]
*  There's a fantastic interview between Marlon Brando, who I'm semi-obsessed with him, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=366.32s)]
*  and Dick Cavett from the early 70s. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=372.56s)]
*  And Brando says, acting, people are acting all the time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=375.04s)]
*  There's no difference between what I'm doing and what you, Dick Cavett, are doing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=378.36s)]
*  You're saying what you have to say in a convincing way to try and achieve the objective. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  And Dick Cavett says, well, you know, he just brushes it off. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=386.16s)]
*  So there's no way that you could equate what I'm doing with what you, Marlon Brando, are able to do. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=389.04s)]
*  And you can tell Brando, I don't know why, but at some point he's soured on the idea [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  that acting was this special endeavor. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  And he said, you know, everyone's an actor. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=400.32s)]
*  It's glorified lying. That's what it is. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it's glorified telling the truth. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=406.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  It's different. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think what truth you're going for, I don't even know. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  But it's not lying. It's finding the truth. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=415.36s)]
*  You write in the book about sort of what a bolt from the blue Marlon Brando was when he came along. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=420.08s)]
*  And then you also mention sitting in a theater and watching The Graduate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=426.56s)]
*  And I think the way you put it was, you know, you're watching Dustin Hoffman [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  break the speed of sound barrier in that film. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=434.32s)]
*  But do you think since that time, have you seen anyone who you thought did something new in acting? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, of our time in the 70s, I don't know. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=445.8s)]
*  A lot of us, I think, were influenced. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  But I have to say, with all modesty, all the modesty I can muster, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=457.88s)]
*  when I was a kid, 13 years old, I remember finishing a performance of a play I was in. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=464.12s)]
*  And I don't know whether I did well or not in it. Who knows? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=469.48s)]
*  This guy comes an older man, an adult, comes up to me and says, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  hey kid, wow, you're the next Marlon Brando. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=476.12s)]
*  So you see, there's the thing, you know, you say, and people throw things out, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=480.92s)]
*  like who's the best one? Marlon himself would say, I don't want to know the best. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=485.56s)]
*  There is no best. He was an original. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=489.88s)]
*  He was an original. Who was like him? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you think you were original? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=496.68s)]
*  I just could say offhand, I don't think so. I don't know. I don't want to be, you know, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=501.16s)]
*  I just, I'd be honest as honest as I can be. But I don't know. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you a very specific question about one of your performances. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=515.24s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=519.32s)]
*  I went back and rewatched a ton of stuff. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=520.68s)]
*  Poor guy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=522.68s)]
*  So in Scent of a Woman, okay, you know, there's the big climactic monologue, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=524.28s)]
*  you know, that if I was the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flamethrower to that play. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=529.56s)]
*  So the aspect of that, I'm just picking this as one example of a thing that you're able to do that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=533.48s)]
*  is I find so compelling as an actor. So you're giving that speech. And even in the space between [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=539.48s)]
*  words, we can see little micro emotions just sort of flash across your face, you know, it's, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=547.32s)]
*  you can telegraph that Colonel Frank Slade is having thoughts in those moments, even when he's [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=554.0400000000001s)]
*  not saying something. And I think, is that something that you're in conscious control of? Or [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=559.4000000000001s)]
*  is that just, you're exuding something in the moment that is beyond your control? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=573.32s)]
*  It's the latter. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=575.24s)]
*  I would say that's what happens. It's, I have always felt that to free the unconscious, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=576.28s)]
*  to allow that freedom, that's what my favorite quote of Michelangelo's, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=583.16s)]
*  free me of myself, Lord, that I may please you. That freedom, that's the whole idea of relaxation [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=589.4799999999999s)]
*  and everything else, which is once you get into that freedom, the unconscious goes to work. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=596.52s)]
*  I just heard the other day that someone was able to hear the Big Bang. You can hear it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=603.0s)]
*  That's what they've done. I mean, when I heard my son told me, I couldn't believe it. I felt so [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=611.64s)]
*  great. He says, you want to hear it? I said, no, no, no, just the idea that it's out there. And it's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=618.1999999999999s)]
*  kind of muffled. It happened. We're real. We exist. This is the greatest thing that can happen. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  What information? I went to bed high just from that. But as far as your question goes, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=632.76s)]
*  I know I go off on things. Let me tell you, pal. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=640.52s)]
*  An actor was telling me that he attributed this to something that he thinks Meryl Streep [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=644.92s)]
*  was quoted as saying, which is that every good script has a scene that makes the actor think like, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=650.28s)]
*  how the hell am I going to do that? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=656.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=658.44s)]
*  So what's an example of a scene that really you thought, how am I going to pull that one off? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=659.08s)]
*  Let me see. I know I've had that feeling before. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=669.4s)]
*  When we get to that, what's going to happen? Oh my God. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=672.92s)]
*  What about killing Salazzo in Godfather 1? Was that one of those scenes? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=676.84s)]
*  Salazzo? No. I mean, that's easy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just don't want the gun to go wrong. I mean, yeah, you just go there. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=684.52s)]
*  My friend Charlie told me. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=695.64s)]
*  Your friend Charles Lotton. Yeah. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=697.0s)]
*  Yeah, my friend Charlie Lotton. How? How are you going to go in there and be the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  don of all these guys, these great actors like Duval and all these people around that thing? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=705.4s)]
*  I was just a homeless a couple of years before that. So I said, well, I mean, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  it's in the script. I tell somebody you're out, you're out. I don't know if you say it a million [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  ways. You don't go, you're out. See, it's like- [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=730.36s)]
*  Do it three different ways right now. Show me some how to do you're out three different ways. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=733.88s)]
*  No, actors don't do that. Actors don't. It's like saying- [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=737.88s)]
*  Wait, you don't like it when I say act monkey? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=740.76s)]
*  I'll say to you, interview, interview. Go ahead and let me see you interview. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=743.72s)]
*  Not me. Tell me about your childhood. Tell me about your childhood. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=747.48s)]
*  What's your primal heartbreak? I can do it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=750.92s)]
*  I hate to be shown up like that. Well, you know, in the book, you say [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=755.24s)]
*  that directors have insulted me throughout my life. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=761.08s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Many of them have. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=764.04s)]
*  Tell me one. Many people have. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=768.12s)]
*  A great director. What was his name? The guy directed the great, you know, Mozart film. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=772.8399999999999s)]
*  Amadeus. Yeah, Milos Forman. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  Milos Forman. You know, he's so great. I'm having dinner with a few people. He just came up. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=784.92s)]
*  How do you do this fucking scoffy? You do dog day afternoon and you do this [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=790.12s)]
*  fucking scoffy. You know who else said it? Who? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  My favorite, Sidney Lamant said, Al, how do you go in there and do that crap? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=802.52s)]
*  And he was so mad. And I kept thinking, I don't feel that way. So, you know, if I felt, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  I actually, I love their passion. I have to say that I'm not being like some [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=815.88s)]
*  Mother Teresa. You're being nice. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=822.76s)]
*  No, I'm not being. Somebody says, how do you do that shit? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=824.76s)]
*  You say, I love your passion. You're enlightened. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=827.4s)]
*  Yeah. And thank God, merciful, that I can say today it's one of the biggest films I've ever made. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=831.0s)]
*  Yeah, Scarface. You know, it's interesting that you mentioned Scarface because- [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=840.8399999999999s)]
*  It keeps going. When I think of Scarface, I wonder if in some ways it's not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=844.36s)]
*  purely in terms of your acting style, a pivotal movie for you. Scarface was the first time you [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=851.48s)]
*  kind of really went operatic over the top. The question is, if in doing that, it changed [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=858.6s)]
*  something about your acting or opened something up in you, because if you look at the roles you [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=867.16s)]
*  do after, I feel like you're much more likely to sort of go big than you were before. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=872.44s)]
*  Yeah. I got that reputation. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=878.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you think Scarface opened something up in you or sort of changed what you did in some fundamental [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=881.4000000000001s)]
*  way? Well, I, you know, like I was saying, look, I'm sorry, some of the early stuff I did in school, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=886.44s)]
*  14, 15 years old when I did it was in those plays. That was still the best work I ever did. Or when [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=896.76s)]
*  I think the best work, it's not the best work. It simply was the most inspired work I had done. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=903.16s)]
*  You know, I didn't know what I was doing. The most inspired work you did was a 14 or 15 year [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=909.2399999999999s)]
*  old kid? I think so. I think so because I was so in it. And that's why the teacher came and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=912.8399999999999s)]
*  talked to my mom and came to my house to tell her about me and that she, I should pursue this thing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=919.8s)]
*  And that was when I was in high school performing arts. And I first, the first things I did were [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=928.28s)]
*  absolutely absurd. And the kids in class were laughing when I would perform. But as, as time [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=933.9599999999999s)]
*  went on, I got a little bit of a drift of it and I did some things. But what I'm getting at is [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=941.0s)]
*  Scarface was done that way. Scarface came from a way, a place that was different than anything [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=946.84s)]
*  I'd done before. That's true. You must get actors, directors who have said to you at some point, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=952.68s)]
*  thinking about other performances you've done, something to the effect of, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=958.76s)]
*  give me more Al Pacino. What do you think they're looking for when they say something like that? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=962.6s)]
*  Go louder. I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I mean, bring it up to, I don't know, nobody's [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=967.96s)]
*  said that. Oh, they did say things to me in the theater from time to time. And I had to adjust [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=974.28s)]
*  to directors. And say things like what? Say things like, you see, somebody, one director came up to [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=981.56s)]
*  me once when I was young. You have to understand, I was young here and he came up to me and said, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  you see, the character did this and the character comes in and then, you know, he's feeling this way [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=993.88s)]
*  here and he does this. So I said to him, I just said, well, you seem to really relate to this [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1000.2s)]
*  person. I said, he said what? I said, yeah, I said, maybe you should play him. Dead silence. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1007.96s)]
*  I don't like that kind of talk. That kind of talk is, you know, a director who's directing you and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1017.32s)]
*  is helping you with your part is telling you how to do it. I don't understand that. Then why did [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  you cast me in the first place? Well, what's a great note that you got from a director? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1029.48s)]
*  One of the best notes I ever got was from Lee Strasburg when we were doing Injustice for All. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1036.6s)]
*  I came in and I was doing the scene and then they just leaned over to me and said, darling, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  you gotta learn your lines. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1050.68s)]
*  Seems like good advice. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1052.44s)]
*  Great advice. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1053.64s)]
*  In the book, there's an offhand line in the book. You say there's the general belief that I'm a [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1055.96s)]
*  cocaine addict or was one. I've never heard that before. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1061.0s)]
*  I don't know. I assumed it. I made a mistake. These assumptions is what is going to kill everybody [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1065.4s)]
*  because assumptions turn into opinions. I heard it somewhere. They're shocked when they find out [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1071.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't take cocaine. I never took it in my life. It's the kind of drug that a person like. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1080.52s)]
*  Who's shocked? Who are these people? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  I wish I knew, but you know, I have a grapevine over at my house and that's where I get it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1087.56s)]
*  I'm not the kind of guy who take coke. Any upper, I don't need. I'm up. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1094.36s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1098.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1101.08s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1101.58s)]
*  In a bunch of your movies, there is really an opportunity. Usually it's a monologue. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1107.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1113.26s)]
*  You just really get to do your thing. So I mentioned, if a woman has that or [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1113.76s)]
*  remember in City Hall, there's a great speech. I choose to fight back or any given Sunday, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1120.62s)]
*  uh, inches of the difference. We live in a diet or I keep a devil's advocate, right? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1126.78s)]
*  There's a God. He's an absentee landlord. But when you, when you see those parts in a script, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1134.38s)]
*  some part of you must know when I get here, I am going to give the thing that people want. Right? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1142.94s)]
*  Exactly. That's what they came for. A lot of people, a lot of people don't like it. I must [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1150.8600000000001s)]
*  say, and I sometimes go too far. I think, and I don't think through it enough. It comes to me a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1156.22s)]
*  little easier because I love words. You know, I love to say words and I really do think I can, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1161.82s)]
*  I can do with some taking it down a bit. I really do. It's a confession, but Hey, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1168.7s)]
*  if it's ham, as long as it's not spam. That's what they used to say. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1176.7s)]
*  Okay. Al, I also want to ask you about the subject of money because in the book you write [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1181.82s)]
*  about growing up really poor and also about how I think it was in the two thousands, you lost a [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1188.86s)]
*  bunch of money because your accountant ripped you off. And before that it sounded like you were, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1194.06s)]
*  let's say, spending lustily. I think your $400,000 a month was the figure you gave. You said your, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1198.86s)]
*  your landscaper was getting $400,000 a year. Yeah. All that made me think, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1205.4199999999998s)]
*  what is this man's relationship with money? Oh, no, you don't want to know. It may be catching. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1209.98s)]
*  In what ways? You'll go down the drain for sure. But in what ways did growing up the way you grew [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1214.8600000000001s)]
*  up where money was not readily at hand, do you think shaped your relationship later on with money? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1220.22s)]
*  You know, I'm a kind of person. I think that if I don't understand something very well, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1226.3s)]
*  I just avoid it. There's no sense. You know, if I, if I have a need to learn it, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1233.26s)]
*  you know, actually, you know, my, my father, who I, you know, I didn't know really, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1240.06s)]
*  he was an accountant and a very good one, apparently. And he, you know, so he sort of knew. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1246.94s)]
*  He'd have to, wouldn't he? I mean, but I, I, I moved away from that only because I, I, I, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1256.8600000000001s)]
*  was always into my work or other kinds of things that had nothing to do with money, except, you [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1264.22s)]
*  know, you know, a fool, whatever that saying is, that was very applicable. Oh, a fool and his money [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1270.3s)]
*  are soon parted. I soon parted. Also, you write in the book about how, you know, you just were [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1277.1s)]
*  started to take more roles often because, you know, they're paying gigs, they're, and my question [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1284.3s)]
*  about that is how do you calibrate how much of yourself to put into a performance in that type [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1290.7s)]
*  of circumstance? Because, you know, it's one thing if you're doing, you know, Serpico or Dog Day [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1298.8600000000001s)]
*  Afternoon, or even Sea of Love, it seems to me it would be impossible or foolhardy to put the same [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1303.74s)]
*  amount of energy and detail into, I don't know, Righteous Kill or 88 Minutes or something like [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1310.22s)]
*  that. So is there like a conscious calibration that happens on your part? Yeah, there would have [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1317.5s)]
*  to be, but everything I do, I try to do the best I can in it. So that would require certain things. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1322.86s)]
*  And, you know, people maybe sometimes are scratched their head and says, what is he doing? Why are [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1331.26s)]
*  you going through all these, you know, machinations in order to do this role? I mean, and I understand [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1336.22s)]
*  that, but that's the way I've always worked, you see. So I approach these things like, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1342.06s)]
*  okay, what can we do with this? So, and finally, I enjoy the whole idea, or maybe make myself [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1349.9s)]
*  enjoy the whole idea of being in the editing room or the afterglow or the, you know, after you do it, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1359.26s)]
*  you have to then fix it. You know, sometimes I would actually even put my own money back into [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1366.62s)]
*  this film I did for money. So I would do that in the effort to see if I can get it to mediocre, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1372.54s)]
*  then I would be accomplishing something. And I never did. And I have to say about films now, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1380.9399999999998s)]
*  over, I don't know, to me, it feels like the last 20 years, but pretty much [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1389.02s)]
*  films are changing because of the streamers. Yeah. How so? Well, there's more work for everybody, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1394.94s)]
*  but the quality of it has changed a little bit in just in its consistent output. And for one thing, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1403.18s)]
*  things seem to be a little more rushed, which means everything is operating on a, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1412.06s)]
*  I don't want to call it a treadmill, but on that thing that goes through the, you know, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1421.74s)]
*  Charlie Chaplin film, or what is that thing? Like a conveyor belt. Yeah, conveyor belt. Yeah. So, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1427.1799999999998s)]
*  you know, you know that you're a part of something. And sometimes some of those movies, you try to [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1433.34s)]
*  bring them to a level where you are trying to find what's most interesting in a film, to bring it out [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1440.62s)]
*  and to expose it and allow it to flourish. That's what you're after so that it communicates. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1448.62s)]
*  I was reading Richard Burton's diaries. You ever read those? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1456.3s)]
*  No, I did. A little bit I did. I loved Richard Burton. Yeah. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1460.1399999999999s)]
*  I know you love him. And in his diaries, he really suggests that he felt like he [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1463.02s)]
*  underserved his talent by acting in a bunch of stuff that was beneath his skills. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1469.74s)]
*  Is that a concern that you ever had? Or how did you guard against it? When sort of in the 90s and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1476.7s)]
*  beyond, you then said, I'm not just going to sit around for years waiting for the perfect role. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1483.66s)]
*  I'm going to just take stuff. And sometimes the stuff's probably not going to be blue chip, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1488.54s)]
*  but I'll try and make it as good as I can. Yeah. But is there ever a concern that you, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1492.22s)]
*  or was there ever a concern that it might tarnish the gift to take material that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1497.18s)]
*  maybe wasn't at the level you were capable of? I really don't think so. I think I looked for [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1502.6200000000001s)]
*  something that I could relate to and that I would feel inclined to want to play it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1509.42s)]
*  That feeling comes to say, I have an appetite to do this. See, athletes, it's clear with, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1519.58s)]
*  you know. You lose your fastball. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1527.98s)]
*  Yeah. You lose your fastball. You don't get down at first as quickly. You know, your eye is not, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1529.4199999999998s)]
*  and you know you're going. All sports have that, but the actor has other roles they can go to. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1536.1399999999999s)]
*  Other roles that, you know, are, you know, you say, I'm doing Lear. I'm doing King Lear. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1545.18s)]
*  I'm doing an adaptation of a film of Lear. And I want to. And I'm trying to stick through those [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1552.3s)]
*  kinds of things because I went through a period of time and you always do in this. You see it, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1560.6200000000001s)]
*  everybody has it. Other actors have it in my position too. They do things sometimes. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1567.58s)]
*  Sometimes for financial reasons, but sometimes also because you just don't want to sit around [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1572.86s)]
*  and you want to find something that can get busy. I'm sure other actors would say other things about [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1579.1s)]
*  their interpretations of different things they did. Some actors can't articulate things. I was [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1586.86s)]
*  one of them. I'm still am in a way. There's sort of a kind of a thing about articulating what you're [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1592.86s)]
*  articulating, what you're doing is as if you're being found out. You know, that's why I didn't [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1599.58s)]
*  care for interviews much when I was young. A long time. Yeah. Yeah. Because I thought what they did [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1606.14s)]
*  is they expose a part of you that then people reflect and then when they see you in a character, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1611.02s)]
*  they think, you know, now they all think, when is Al going to yell? I bought that ticket for Al to [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1618.94s)]
*  yell. Is he yelling at me? I need it. I need someone to talk to me that way. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1624.78s)]
*  But what changed your mind then that made you feel comfortable [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1634.7s)]
*  pulling back the curtain by doing interviews and things like that? Why did you change your mind? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1638.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, I could relate it to Picasso for one time. Picasso, they did this great [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1644.78s)]
*  documentary on Picasso and he, and he's, he goes and he makes a painting and you see him make it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1653.82s)]
*  And then he takes it and he holds it up beside him. And there's Picasso and there's the painting [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1660.54s)]
*  and it's like you have two people there, you know, doesn't matter. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1667.26s)]
*  Because the painting exists. That's what I thought. I think it made me think a little bit. It made me [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1672.78s)]
*  think, well, you know, if Picasso can do that, wow. You know, I'm this person that you're seeing now [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1678.38s)]
*  and I think I'm partially, I'm doing an interview. I'm not this way when I go downstairs. I mean, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1687.42s)]
*  I wouldn't have any friends and I'd be, you know, I don't see it. I, but I do feel also doing the book [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1694.38s)]
*  has opened me up a little bit too. You know, you care a little less as you get older too. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1703.98s)]
*  I don't mean to bring that in, but you do. You sort of say, hey man, you know, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1709.26s)]
*  say what you have to say. What's, you know, what happened. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1714.7s)]
*  Well, so has aging been comfortable or uncomfortable for you? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1718.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the hell aging is. It seems absurd and crazy. I don't even understand it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1723.98s)]
*  Yeah. I wish I had something. I, I sometimes see, you know, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1729.58s)]
*  why can't I find some steroids around that won't kill me? You know, I'm just looking at [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1734.78s)]
*  who would I know that has steroids and keeps living with them, you know? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1741.74s)]
*  Cause I took some when I had the bad COVID, the first time I had it, where I sort of. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1748.3799999999999s)]
*  You almost died. Yeah. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1754.4599999999998s)]
*  Well, they said my pulse was gone and I thought that's enough, but I thought it was so like, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1755.74s)]
*  so well, you're here. You're not, you're here. You're not. And I thought, wow, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1764.54s)]
*  you don't even have your memories. You have nothing. Strange part. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1771.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1777.8999999999999s)]
*  Towards the end of the book, there's a couple of very moving passages about your youngest son, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1780.78s)]
*  Roman. And you're sort of musing about he's what, one, one and a half, something like that? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1787.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. He was less than that when I was musing about it, you know? He's coming to the world [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1793.26s)]
*  a little more now, you know, he's learning things. How much of the desire to set your story down [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1799.34s)]
*  was about wanting him to be able to know what your life was? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1807.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. He will. I mean, you know, that's, that's the way the world, whatever, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1816.86s)]
*  whatever, which way the world goes, you know, if we're talking about 20 years from now, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  who can speak to that? I mean, that's, that I can't, can you predict anything now? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1827.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, I just wondered if some part of you is thinking you wanted to have your story in your [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1833.82s)]
*  words for him, because he's so young now. Well, that's one of the reasons. Yes, of course. Yeah. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1838.62s)]
*  Yeah. And that has been a campaign for me to get a little older, you know, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1846.22s)]
*  and stick around a little longer if it's possible. But I got to say, you know, just, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1853.5s)]
*  uh, and this is probably more sort of psychoanalysis than you're interested in. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1858.14s)]
*  Is it not possible that on some level, having a child at 83 years old is a reaction to [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1863.8200000000002s)]
*  the recognition of your own mortality? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1872.94s)]
*  Wow, that was something. I don't know. I have to think about that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1877.5s)]
*  I got four children, you know, so I'm happy about that, but no, I, I, I don't know. Maybe [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1883.1s)]
*  I don't even understand it. I'm saying what? Well, you know, like when I saw the little baby [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1894.3799999999999s)]
*  there and the way he was, you just, you're looking at a little differently now, you know, you look [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1901.58s)]
*  at it like, what, what is this? This is so amazing. That's why I was so excited by the, uh, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1910.14s)]
*  hearing the big bang because I thought, my God, I'm not going to die. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1918.46s)]
*  I don't mean literally. I mean, spiritually, look at that. There's something out there that's bigger [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1927.74s)]
*  than us. You can't say better because you don't really know them, but something's out there. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1934.14s)]
*  That's more than we understand. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1940.5400000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you one last one for this time. If I were going to go away and figure out how to play [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1945.18s)]
*  Al Pacino in your life or in a movie, either one, what's the secret to, uh, portraying you? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1951.5s)]
*  Well, I think you should just go to some of those [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1959.9s)]
*  metal houses and study some of those people there. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1963.98s)]
*  After the break, Al shares more about his near brush with death. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1979.34s)]
*  I opened my eyes and everybody was around me. First time that ever happened. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1983.98s)]
*  And they said, he's back. You know, he's here. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1988.78s)]
*  Hi, Al. Hi. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=1993.98s)]
*  You know, I have a handful of questions. Some are our followups to stuff we talked about before. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2006.94s)]
*  Some are different, but I love it. I, you know, we started to talk to each other and you're going [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2011.42s)]
*  to find as we all find we're in different moods. Every time we speak, every day, I change. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2016.78s)]
*  Well, how's your mood today? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2024.94s)]
*  I have a mood that seems a little bit better than the last time we spoke. And I don't know why. I [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2027.5s)]
*  feel I'm, I might be a little more articulate today, wishful thinking, but I think I might. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2034.46s)]
*  Well, give it a shot and see how it goes. But you know, I'm thinking about it. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2042.7s)]
*  Okay, sure. Yeah, I'm thinking about how you had made this kind of offhand comment earlier [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2045.42s)]
*  about how you're not the same guy talking to me as you are when you go downstairs in your house. And [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2052.54s)]
*  you know, if you were that same guy, you wouldn't have any friends. But I want to know how is the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2057.34s)]
*  guy downstairs in your house different from the guy talking to me? Who's that guy? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2061.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I can't answer a question like that. I don't understand what you're talking about, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2067.26s)]
*  actually. I really don't. I'm in the moment and whatever's in the moment is who I am. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2072.78s)]
*  When I'm going down the stairs, I'm obviously thinking of other things, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2081.26s)]
*  but I have to really think about falling down the stairs. These are the things I think about. And [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2084.7000000000003s)]
*  when I'm sitting and thinking about some, you know, I have a lot of things I can think about. I have, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2090.3s)]
*  you know, four kids, I have all kinds of projects and, you know, I'm occupied. I don't know [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2097.9s)]
*  what else I could say. The guy I am now is talking to you. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2106.38s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. It's the subject that matters. You're asking me an impression of what I am. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2111.9s)]
*  I don't know, do you have an impression of what you are? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2121.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2123.98s)]
*  Really? Will you objectify yourself? Okay. I don't think about that. Sometimes I even see myself in [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2125.6600000000003s)]
*  the mirror and I get a little shocked at first. That happens. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2135.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting for me to hear you say that because- [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2141.1800000000003s)]
*  I know you're getting at something. You started getting at it. When did we speak? This week? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2142.94s)]
*  Yeah, a couple days ago. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2150.3s)]
*  Oh, okay. You started getting at this very thing. And I thought, I don't know what this guy's doing [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2152.46s)]
*  or where he's taking this thing, but I'm sorry. I don't know how to comply. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2157.1s)]
*  Oh no, you don't need to apologize. I think the thing I'm getting at or trying to get at [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2163.34s)]
*  is when you said back to me, like, do you sit there and have some, like, objectify yourself and [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2167.9s)]
*  think I know who I am? And I said, yes. And I wonder if that's the difference between [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2173.02s)]
*  someone who's an actor and someone who's not. Maybe someone who's able to inhabit other [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2178.86s)]
*  personalities has a greater sense of malleability about- [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2184.7s)]
*  Yeah. I actually had that thought when I asked you. I said, I think maybe he might be thinking [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2188.22s)]
*  because I'm an actor that I inhabit other characters. I don't know. You know, you call on, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2194.38s)]
*  there are some actors who are more or less, you know, mimics. They're more on the mimic side. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2202.94s)]
*  And there are others that, it's a form of mimicry in some way. You know, you're pretending to be [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2209.02s)]
*  somebody else, but then you're not pretending anymore. You absorb it enough times and you [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2219.1s)]
*  become it. But that requires a certain amount of focus and acumen and time and patience. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2226.3s)]
*  Everything to me is time. It's time. It's like anything. You know, you paint your house and you [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2236.7000000000003s)]
*  start painting and you start painting one of the rooms and then you go and move again and you paint [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2244.3s)]
*  another room and then you paint that room again. And then what happens is the way you painted the [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2252.2999999999997s)]
*  first time, the first room, by the time you've painted about 40 or 50 of them, you're a different [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2257.58s)]
*  painter. That's what I think. Wait, but you're working on a film adaptation of King Lear, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2264.7s)]
*  which is obviously a mountain of a role. And one you've never played before, right? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2273.18s)]
*  No, I've never played it. I've stayed away from it forever. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2278.62s)]
*  Yeah. Tell me why you stayed away and why you're taking it now. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2282.22s)]
*  Well, why I'm taking it now is I've been, you know, people have been encouraging me to do it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2286.06s)]
*  10 years ago, I remember thinking I had no interest in it. And then I started reading it all the time. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2293.02s)]
*  And I saw it a few times too, and I got to know it. And it wasn't until I realized [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2300.94s)]
*  things, I got older and some of the things that I, I, I, so now that they're easier, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2312.3s)]
*  but I understand them more. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2319.26s)]
*  Well, so how are you understanding Lear? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2321.82s)]
*  Yeah, I can't talk to you like that. I understand Lear, but that's my secret. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2323.42s)]
*  I want to go back to your COVID near death experience. I know you described this a little. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2330.86s)]
*  I love to revisit that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2337.02s)]
*  Let's revisit the time you almost died. Yeah. Just tell me about what happened. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2339.9s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what happened was I felt not good, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2345.34s)]
*  unusually not good. And I had a fever and I was getting dehydrated and all that. So [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2351.6600000000003s)]
*  I got someone to get me a nurse to hydrate me. I was sitting there in my house and I was gone. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2359.82s)]
*  Like that. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2370.7000000000003s)]
*  So you just went from consciousness to no consciousness. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2372.1400000000003s)]
*  Absolutely gone. Yeah. So then they looked at my, at my pulse and I didn't have a pulse. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2375.34s)]
*  It probably was very, very low. And they didn't, they got panicked right away in a matter [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2383.98s)]
*  of minutes, I guess, or whatever it took. They were there, ambulance in front of my house. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2391.6600000000003s)]
*  And I had about six paramedics in that living room and there were two doctors and they have [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2398.1400000000003s)]
*  these outfits on that looked like they were from outer space or something. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2403.34s)]
*  So it was kind of shocking to open your eyes and see that. I opened my eyes and everybody [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2409.6600000000003s)]
*  was around me. It was the first time that had happened. And they said, he's back. He's here. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2416.3s)]
*  Well, did that experience sort of have any sort of metaphysical ripples for you? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2423.82s)]
*  Yes, it did. It actually did. I didn't see the white light or anything like that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2429.58s)]
*  I, I, there was nothing there. As Hamlet says it to be or not to be, you know, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2436.38s)]
*  the unknown country from whose born, no traveler returns. And he says two words, no more. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2443.2599999999998s)]
*  It was no more. I don't like that, that there's no more. It's gone. You're gone. Now I started [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2451.74s)]
*  thinking about that and I never thought about it in my life. But you know, actors, it sounds good [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2464.2999999999997s)]
*  to me to say I died once. It felt like death. What is it when there's no more? I mean, you do [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2470.8599999999997s)]
*  have this body of work that you know that people will be going back to for [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2479.34s)]
*  at least a little while. Is that consolation at all? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2483.82s)]
*  Well, yes. And the kids, you know, having children and all is a consolation. And it's natural, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2487.7400000000002s)]
*  I guess, to have a different sort of view on death as you get older, you know. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2495.1800000000003s)]
*  That's it's just the way it is. I didn't expect it. I didn't ask for it. Just comes like a lot of [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2502.54s)]
*  things just come. Well, I don't want to linger in morbidity, but I don't find this morbid, right? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2510.38s)]
*  But I have one more, perhaps slightly more question, but you know, your, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2521.66s)]
*  your youngest son, like when you're not around, what performance of yours should he watch to, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2525.8199999999997s)]
*  to see what his old man was capable of? I think he, I think he should start off with Adam Sandler's. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2531.1s)]
*  Jack and Jill. What was that? Jack and Jill. I think that's funny. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2536.86s)]
*  Adam Sandler is just the greatest guy. He's just become a great actor. And I really enjoyed so much [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2541.3399999999997s)]
*  his company. And it came at a time in my life that I needed it because it was pretty much after I, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2549.42s)]
*  I found out I had no more money because my, my, my, you know, my accountant was in prison [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2555.66s)]
*  and I needed something quickly. So I took this. There's this thing I do in that film. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2564.7s)]
*  They got me doing is a Dunkin Donuts commercial. You know, many people think I actually made that [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2575.02s)]
*  commercial. I mean, it's just so unfair. You did it. You did it. Yeah. I mean, after it, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2581.5s)]
*  at the end of it, I say to Adam in the scene, when I say to him, this does not go on. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2592.38s)]
*  No, he says, no. I said, just, no, it won't go on. I won't put it off. But he put the film on it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2601.66s)]
*  It's always been all over the internet. I thought it was funny that, you know, you said your, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1P5x47poA&t=2608.78s)]
