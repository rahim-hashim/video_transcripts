# Jenna Ortega Is Still Recovering From Childhood Stardom
**New York Times - The Interview:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=0.0s)]
*  This week, I sat down with Jenna Ortega. And if you have a tween daughter like I do, this [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=10.24s)]
*  is a very big deal. In 2022, Ortega starred as the title character in Wednesday, the Addams [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=15.76s)]
*  Family reboot produced by Tim Burton for Netflix. And she became an instant hero to both kids [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=23.26s)]
*  and adults like me, who adored her snarky, dark, and brutally honest personality. Suddenly [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=30.04s)]
*  Wednesday and by extension Ortega was everywhere. On merch, Halloween costumes, all over the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=35.76s)]
*  internet doing her endlessly memeable dance moves. It was the kind of star-making, culture [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=42.2s)]
*  saturating event that is life-changing for a young actor. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=47.84s)]
*  But Ortega didn't just suddenly appear out of nowhere. She's been working since she [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=52.64s)]
*  was a kid herself, on the Disney Channel and in shows like Jane the Virgin. As an adult, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=56.92s)]
*  she's also become a regular in the horror world starring in both the Scream and X franchises. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=62.68s)]
*  Ortega is 21 now and her next big role is in the new movie Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=68.12s)]
*  the sequel to Burton's 1988 classic, where she plays the daughter of Winona Ryder's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=73.4s)]
*  character. When I caught up with her, she was filming the second season of Wednesday [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=78.4s)]
*  in Ireland. We talked about her time as a child actor, her Latina roots, her upcoming [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=83.2s)]
*  projects and her newfound fame. And what came across is that Ortega is a deeply thoughtful [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=88.68s)]
*  and curious person who, like many young people, is still trying to find out who she is, all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=94.4s)]
*  while dealing with the glare of a massive spotlight. Here's my conversation with Jenna Ortega. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=100.08s)]
*  Before we talk about the Beetlejuice film, I wanted to ask you just a little bit about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=113.2s)]
*  what your life is like when you're filming in a place that you're not familiar with. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=123.04s)]
*  I mean, do you hang out with your co-stars? Do you just focus on your work? Like, what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  is the vibe day to day? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, currently I'm working on being better about hanging out or prioritizing a normal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  life outside of work because I typically just hide away in a hole and lose all sense of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=141.12s)]
*  self and life outside of my job. And I don't do that intentionally and that's not to be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  dramatic, but I think it's really easy on a job where, for example, I do a lot of horror [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  and things like that. There's a lot of night shoots. You know, you're not working regular [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=156.28s)]
*  hours. It's kind of hard to communicate with people during the day because you're technically [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  supposed to be sleeping. Me working on location usually consists of walking around for a bit, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  maybe going for a run, finding like a local cafe that I know I like the coffee there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=170.52s)]
*  And then that's about it. I usually find a nice river and a park bench to write on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=176.96s)]
*  You like to journal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I love to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about that. Like, why did you get started doing that? And what do [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=185.22s)]
*  you journal about? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I got into that because I lost all sense of self and life while I started working and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  traveling for the first time because I first started traveling when I was around 18. So [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=196.12s)]
*  it's been a few years of this. I love to journal about my dreams mainly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=200.88s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=206.68s)]
*  Yes, because dreams to me are really fascinating because I feel like I learn a lot about myself [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=208.16s)]
*  through them. I've been able to notice patterns in my way of thinking based on how stressed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=214.72s)]
*  I may be. Lack of sleep. Sometimes I end up in this middle state where I'm actually inspired [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=221.6s)]
*  and become creative over the ideas that I had while I was still somewhat awake. And [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=226.6s)]
*  sometimes it's complete nonsense. None of it makes sense. It'll be balloons made out [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  of frogs. Like, it doesn't matter, but other times it'll be a really special story. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=236.4s)]
*  It's cool that you remember it though. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=241.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=243.32s)]
*  Okay. Let's talk about the movie. When did you first see the original Beetlejuice? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=244.32s)]
*  Honestly, I can't really put a date on it. I feel like I had to have seen it maybe when [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=250.16s)]
*  I was around eight or nine. I was terrified of everything when I was younger. I actually [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  had a reoccurring nightmare about Beetlejuice. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=259.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=262.48s)]
*  Yeah, but I think I actually got scared because I saw a really terrible Halloween costume [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=263.48s)]
*  before I really knew what the movie was. And I think that the molds and smearing, like [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=268.76s)]
*  bleeding green and black Party City makeup gave me a scare. Anyway, I just remember that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=274.8s)]
*  image. And then I watched the movie later and I thought, oh man, this is what the guy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=281.48s)]
*  was dressed as. This is just as scary. So yeah, I think around then. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  What were your nightmares about Beetlejuice? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=291.48s)]
*  I shared a room my entire life growing up and I was the bottom bunk on a bunk bed. And [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=293.56s)]
*  I had a dream that Beetlejuice would come down and swing around the banister down to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=300.28s)]
*  my bunk wearing a Superman cape and would offer me grape juice. And he would say, got [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=306.11999999999995s)]
*  any grape? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  Did you tell this to Michael Keaton when you met him? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  No, no. Maybe I should have, but maybe there was something in me that was still potentially [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  scared and frightened. Meeting him, he was a giant from your childhood. That's intimidating. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=322.44s)]
*  And I think I just, maybe I reverted back to my old adolescent ways in front of him. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=329.84s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  One of the things that I love about Beetlejuice is that it's a film that is full of joy. It's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  not like the scary view of the afterlife, despite what you felt as an eight year old. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  I can understand that, but it is sort of this kind of funky, not terribly dark view of death. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, Tim Burton is obviously a master and I think he's done an incredible job all throughout [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=355.92s)]
*  his career of being able to balance dark topics that most people are, I guess, fearful of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=362.76s)]
*  or avoidant of and make it an acceptable and almost comforting conversation. So it's something [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=369.52s)]
*  like Beetlejuice. You see people reconnecting with loved ones. You see people finding love. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=377.24s)]
*  You see people making discoveries about themselves. It's actually beautifully put, the afterlife [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=383.68s)]
*  rather than hell or something like that, because it's just, it continues. And I think for a [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=389.52s)]
*  lot of people who maybe don't consider death or for young children who can't really understand [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=394.36s)]
*  the concept, I think it's a really easy guide. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  And also just the idea that they're not gone, right? That you can find them afterwards. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=401.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=406.04s)]
*  Do you believe in life after death? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=407.04s)]
*  No. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  I wish, I wish. I wish that I could go and end up in Tim's version of the afterlife, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  but I don't. I really think it just goes black afterwards. I think it's nice and comforting [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=417.96s)]
*  to think otherwise. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=422.52s)]
*  I'm shocked. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=423.52s)]
*  Do you? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=424.52s)]
*  Well, yeah. This is the thing. As a Latina, I grew up believing in ghosts. I had family [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=425.52s)]
*  members see them. My sister, when we were young, was always like, don't you see the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=431.24s)]
*  ghost there? And I'd be like, no, man, I really don't. And you're freaking me out. But it's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  something that is embedded in the way I grew up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=441.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't want to say that ghosts aren't real because I don't want one to come [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=445.24s)]
*  after me. And I also have people who claim that they saw ghosts. I'm sure there's some [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=449.48s)]
*  weird spiritual in-between realm. I do believe in kind of strong energies and things like [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  that. But ultimately, I don't know, life is, there's a lot going on. I would hope that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=459.32s)]
*  you get some good rest afterwards. Also, so much of ghost culture, feels so strange to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=464.68s)]
*  say. I think especially in the Latin community is based off of, you know, it's very religious. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=471.2s)]
*  So I think some of that is maybe to instill fear in young people. Or we just love to take [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  the piss out of everything and harass one another in the most loving way. So I think [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=482.6s)]
*  also to tuck your kids in at night and tell them to watch out for la Llorona. Like that's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  classic. I think that's hilarious. I would do the same with my children. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. And since we're talking about your childhood, I want to talk [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  a little bit about that because you grew up in Coachella Valley. Correct. And I would [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=501.24s)]
*  love for you to tell me a little bit about what you remember from those early days. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=507.72s)]
*  I, looking back on it, had a pretty cool childhood. I grew up in a very loving household. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=512.64s)]
*  My parents are very in love with each other. I'm one of six kids, so I'm the fourth. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=521.28s)]
*  And there's a pair of twins under me. Who did you share your room with? I shared my [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=526.6s)]
*  room with my older sister, Mia, for the longest time. And then when my older sister left, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  Mia got her room. And then my younger sister came into play. So there was no escape for [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=535.68s)]
*  me. I didn't have my own room until I left. But that was nice, too, especially as someone [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=540.8s)]
*  who I would tuck myself in my blanket and I would cover my entire face except for my [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=545.6s)]
*  nose and lips so I could still breathe. And I would wake up in a pile of sweat. I slept [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=550.56s)]
*  on the wooden plank in between the bed and the wall. So when I would wake up in the middle [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=555.16s)]
*  of the night in a panic because I had a terrible nightmare, I could always look over and see [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  my sister and think, oh, okay, cool. So did you have a lot of middle child energy being [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=564.1199999999999s)]
*  the fourth one? No, I feel like I actually kind of had not the opposite. I mean, I was [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  loud and extroverted and all of my family was very shy. And my parents always said [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=577.44s)]
*  that I had the most expression and it made trips to Disneyland or something like that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  worth it because where my siblings would walk around going, oh, okay, that's nice. I was [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=587.6s)]
*  walking around going, oh my God, can you believe it? Ariel waved at me. She saw me. This is [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=592.72s)]
*  the happiest place on earth. I get it. I was very much that, which I don't think is very [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  middle child of me. And your dad was a sheriff and your mom was an emergency room nurse. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=605.84s)]
*  Did that sort of rub off on you? You know, those very intense jobs that deal with really [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=613.4s)]
*  important things, life or death matters? Yeah. I love my parents. I love my mom. She made [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=619.14s)]
*  me think I was going to die with every left turn that I took. Her fear of life and what [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  would happen when we walked out. She'll even say it herself. She's very fear-based and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=633.68s)]
*  she moves based on her fears, which is totally understandable considering the job and the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=637.8s)]
*  horrific phone calls she's had to make or things that she's had to see. It's unbelievable. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=643.76s)]
*  She has unbelievable stories, but I wouldn't want to go outside for weeks. I had to go [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=649.0s)]
*  to school and I would beg her, please don't make me go because I thought that I was going [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=654.68s)]
*  to walk out and was going to get hit by a car instantly or I was going to trip and fall [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=657.5799999999999s)]
*  and bang all my teeth out. I didn't want to pet a dog because I thought a dog was going [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  to bite my face off. You know, I just didn't know what was going to happen. I definitely [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  was and still am to a certain point paranoid. I'm just very cautious of my surroundings [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=671.84s)]
*  and the people around me. Yeah. I mean, I imagine that's true because, you know, if [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=678.2800000000001s)]
*  your mother's been seeing all this stuff, you know, she's going to worry that that's [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  going to happen to you. Yes. Well, did she tell you about it? Did she come home and talk [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=688.68s)]
*  to you about it? She would. And that's the thing. She would explain things in detail, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=692.28s)]
*  which is why I think with the job that I do, it's kind of helped because while I was fearful [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=695.36s)]
*  of it then, I also was simultaneously being very desensitized to things. So I was never [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=700.8s)]
*  really scared by blood or gore, but I think that kind of helped. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=706.36s)]
*  Your first lead came when you landed the Disney show Stuck in the Middle. And then you were [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=714.2s)]
*  a voice actor in the animated Disney show Elena of Avalor, which I will say is my daughter's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=719.6s)]
*  favorite. First Latina princess. And you played her younger sister, who's also a princess. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you remember the significance of being part of that show? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=733.44s)]
*  Yeah, most definitely. When I initially was trying to convince my parents to let me act, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=736.24s)]
*  I remember crying to them one night at the dinner table and just saying, oh man, I can [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=741.4s)]
*  do it. I know I can do it. If you let me do it, I swear to you, I will end up on Disney [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=745.88s)]
*  channel. And they just kind of laughed. So that was a huge marker of success for me when [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=750.68s)]
*  I was really young, just because I had met my promise. I completed my task. And then [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=758.0s)]
*  with Elena of Avalor, I was doing Stuck in the Middle at the time. So I was a familiar [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=763.56s)]
*  face to Disney kids. So Disney channel actually flew me out to Orlando, to Disney world to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=767.88s)]
*  promote the Disney princess in the park. And I remember almost being brought to tears. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=774.8s)]
*  And my mom was definitely crying because we saw Elena walk through the park for the first [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=780.24s)]
*  time. And there was girls of all different ages and colors dressed in her outfit. And [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=785.4s)]
*  that to us was such a glorious moment because it was all I wanted growing up with somebody [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=790.2s)]
*  that I could relate to. And I loved princesses and I wanted to be able to see myself in them. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=796.72s)]
*  I wanted to be Cinderella so bad, but I didn't have blonde hair and that killed me. So something [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=802.4s)]
*  like Elena, I was so little when that happened. I think I must've been 10 when I was first [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=807.8s)]
*  cast, but I knew the significance then and I definitely didn't take it for granted. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=814.12s)]
*  Your parents were very supportive, but they weren't like stage parents, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=820.76s)]
*  They weren't kind of pushing you out there. It sounds like it came all from you. What was [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=826.0s)]
*  the dynamic like, especially among other sort of families who really wanted their kids to become stars? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, when I first started auditioning, we had spent hours in these casting offices [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  and we met so many strange and intense personalities. It could be stage parents, it could be producers [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=844.0s)]
*  that really made me fearful of other people for a while. And I think that's when I kind of started [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=851.28s)]
*  to become more introverted, but it was such a joy to be able to get back in the car at the end of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=857.68s)]
*  the day and just do my homework because I was still going to public school at the time and listen to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=864.0s)]
*  my mom talk and catch up with my siblings at home. When I was on that Disney Channel show, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=868.72s)]
*  my mom was so calm and relaxed. She went back to school, she got her bachelor's degree in that time [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=874.96s)]
*  and she took advantage of that time that she, all those hours she spent with me on set. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=882.96s)]
*  I was just very lucky because it felt very normal. I was in school, she was in school. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=887.12s)]
*  Hey, you want to grab dinner afterwards? Everything was very cozy and close and I knew that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  no matter who I was surrounded by or who I was with, my mom was there right by my side the whole time. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  What do you mean when you say that it made you afraid of other people, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=902.08s)]
*  the kind of personalities that you would meet? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=906.48s)]
*  Because we were so brand new to everything and some of these people had been in it for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=908.88s)]
*  years at the time or every kid in that family was an actor or all of these people had [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  advice and experience and lessons and I didn't know anything about Hollywood. I didn't know [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  anyone. I wanted to be able to do things at my own pace and in my own style but you didn't know [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=927.28s)]
*  if people were saying things to help you or to hurt you and not even on that show just speaking [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=934.64s)]
*  about my career as a child. Overall, there was definitely a few moments where you realized, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=942.16s)]
*  oh maybe that person didn't have my best interest. Maybe they didn't want to be as supportive of me [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=946.64s)]
*  as they said and that's a hard lesson to learn so young and especially hard when you have [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=955.0400000000001s)]
*  adults or people you should know better addressing you in a way that is potentially harmful to [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=960.88s)]
*  somebody whose brain is still growing and developing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  Did you watch Quiet on Set, the doc about Nickelodeon child stars? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=973.44s)]
*  No, I know my mom did and she called me about it a bit but I didn't sit down and watch the whole thing. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=977.2s)]
*  Did it resonate for her? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=983.52s)]
*  No, it didn't but I had had before I was on Disney, I had had some experience with [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=985.84s)]
*  Nickelodeon when I was younger and nothing like that. I don't know all of the stories but I can't [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=992.24s)]
*  relate to anything like that but she just remembers being really grateful that I ended up on a different [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  channel or in a different space because obviously we weren't seeing that side of things but I think [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1004.08s)]
*  for her it was just more so pain because she had seen the way that other children maybe weren't [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1010.08s)]
*  protected or weren't as looked at after. She watched over me like a hawk you know so I think [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1016.4000000000001s)]
*  from her it was more empathizing and wishing she somehow could have done something to help [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1022.64s)]
*  you know that case but she just called me saying she was so grateful that things were [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1031.04s)]
*  okay and that she was there to witness everything. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1034.88s)]
*  Do you think that that's what helps when you're a child actor [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1040.24s)]
*  having parents that are going to protect you? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think I mean child acting is strange. It is in hindsight. I see why my parents felt so [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1046.16s)]
*  hesitant about it because you know you're putting a child in an adult workplace. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  I think if I just stayed growing up in the Coachella Valley I would be a completely different [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1060.24s)]
*  person. I wouldn't speak the way that I do or approach interactions the way that I do. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  It's completely changed my way of thinking and going about life and when I speak to other child [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1069.52s)]
*  actors I can pick them out instantly because we kind of all have that it's just a very specific [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  like some secret little language or something like that that we all share. So children are [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1081.52s)]
*  supposed to be working like that. They are supposed to be you know climbing trees and [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1089.76s)]
*  drawing and going to school. You know some of those kids parents don't even take school [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1095.6s)]
*  seriously so I feel really really fortunate to have had parents who made sure that I hang out [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1101.52s)]
*  with friends made sure that I went to public school and wouldn't allow me to work on a job [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1106.56s)]
*  unless I had straight A's and was prioritizing my sleep and my schoolwork. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1111.36s)]
*  It's funny when you say that you can pick them out in a room. What is that thing? Is it like [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1116.64s)]
*  just like a poise of precociousness? Yes it poise precociousness. It's hard to say because [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1121.2s)]
*  what I'm finding too is oftentimes we mistake it for maturity and it's not. It's almost a mask. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1130.16s)]
*  It's a professionalism that people our age typically aren't equipped with because you're [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1137.28s)]
*  waking up at six in the morning every day and have starting your morning with meetings [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1143.6s)]
*  and coffee and I think it's very important to mention that we think it's maturity and it's not. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1147.68s)]
*  Do you regret it that you chose that path? There's [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1156.8s)]
*  times that I regret it. There's times that my parents regret it. Looking back I wouldn't [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1164.48s)]
*  I wouldn't change anything. I don't believe in that because if anything I'm incredibly grateful [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1171.28s)]
*  for the lessons that it did teach me and it did teach me so much and I do love that when I go on [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1176.8s)]
*  a set now. I'm incredibly knowledgeable of the set around me. I know what the you know camera [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1182.72s)]
*  verbiage means. I know what a gripped job is. I know what a gaffer's job is. I can get along with [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1187.84s)]
*  the DP. I can go through shot lists. I understand it all. I know what's going on around me therefore [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1192.96s)]
*  I feel incredibly safe and comfortable and excited to go to work every day because it's familiar to [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1199.28s)]
*  me. So I guess there's a part of me that as a 21 year old actor now I'm really really grateful [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1203.84s)]
*  for that knowledge and I wouldn't have had that without that experience. Have you talked about it [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1210.8s)]
*  with other former Disney stars I'm thinking of like Selena Gomez and others like that who had a [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1215.76s)]
*  similar experience? Not entirely but I do have a weird habit of connecting with older generation [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1221.68s)]
*  actresses almost instantly and I think it's because of that there's a certain level of empathy and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1229.3600000000001s)]
*  instant want for protection and you know to be able to guide younger people. I've been really [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1236.72s)]
*  really lucky to work with incredible actresses who definitely had a harder upbringing. They've [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  been teachers. They've been mentors and that has definitely helped a lot and been really beautiful. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1251.76s)]
*  Like who? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1257.92s)]
*  Winona Ryder of course. She was so warm and welcoming and kind and inviting right from the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1259.2s)]
*  jump and I couldn't be more grateful. It was at a time where my career was taking a different turn [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1265.2s)]
*  and I didn't realize that I needed that from somebody who could relate but I did. The way [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1269.2s)]
*  Winona and I got along was quite weird. It was like we were reading each other's minds a little bit. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1274.32s)]
*  What advice did she give you? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  It's hard to pinpoint. That you'd want to share. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1282.48s)]
*  Yeah it's hard to pinpoint because I think some of it I would like to keep between us. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1284.48s)]
*  I don't know she just made me feel really it's almost hard to say because it's hard to believe [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1289.28s)]
*  sometimes. She made me feel really really beautiful and special and that was again during that time [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1296.08s)]
*  it meant the world to me. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1304.96s)]
*  During that time it meant the world to me. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1306.24s)]
*  You keep on mentioning that time. I'm just trying to understand what do you mean that time? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1311.52s)]
*  It was a very transformative period of my life. We shot Beetlejuice not that long after Wednesday [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1317.1200000000001s)]
*  it had come out. So you know one day I just I woke up in somebody else's shoes. I felt like I had [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1322.56s)]
*  entered somebody else's life and like I didn't know how to get back to mine. So she you know [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1329.92s)]
*  obviously with the success and attention that she received in the 90s she had experienced that, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1335.04s)]
*  known that probably to an even greater extent. So she was the first person that I connected with [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1341.92s)]
*  on that topic or she made me feel seen where you know other people necessarily in my life [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  as much as they wanted to couldn't relate or couldn't understand. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1354.56s)]
*  I mean it's funny that we've been talking about your Disney days because the stereotype of a [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  Disney star right bubbly precocious is kind of the polar opposite of the roles that you've become [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1363.04s)]
*  famous for as an adult. Did that shift feel like a conscious one for you? Not at all. I remember [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1369.84s)]
*  when I first met with my agent and we were deciding what we wanted to do after Disney Channel, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1378.32s)]
*  what was the move. She asked if there was any genre or anything specifically that I was looking for [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1384.72s)]
*  and I really didn't know what to say. I said I think horror would be cool [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1390.48s)]
*  and I said that but didn't think much about it and it just so happened that a lot of the opportunities [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1394.8799999999999s)]
*  that came my way a few years down the road were primarily horror. How I've become the deadpan, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1399.92s)]
*  dark, brooding teenager I'm not sure. I mean well I can't say that obviously it's because of Wednesday. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1408.72s)]
*  Well you are filming right now the new season of Wednesday. One of the things that I love about [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1415.12s)]
*  the character of Wednesday is that it gives young girls permission to not be nice. You know my daughter [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1421.4399999999998s)]
*  has a Wednesday mug that says I don't bury hatchets I sharpen them. Beautiful. She's 11. She's cool. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1427.6s)]
*  Yeah and you know I think it's a good message for young girls and for women for all of us that you [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1434.4799999999998s)]
*  don't have to be liked all the time. Is that something that you thought about in the character [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1441.12s)]
*  of Wednesday that you know she had acerbic sharp edges? I think Wednesday has taught me [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1447.36s)]
*  the same thing. She's definitely taught me to be a lot more confident, a lot more headstrong. I think [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  it's really easy for women to be labeled difficult or you know a diva or you know just just trouble [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1462.2399999999998s)]
*  and I think that that's ridiculous. It's not a bad thing to be opinionated. That's not a nasty [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1470.48s)]
*  evil thing. It's so important to have opinions. If we don't have opinions where the hell would we be? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1476.64s)]
*  We would get nothing done. It would be a mess. I think everyone should have opinions and I'm glad [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1482.0s)]
*  that Wednesday has ignited that in people. You wrote a book when you were 17 and you talk about [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1487.52s)]
*  insecurities, mental health challenges and you're 21 now and I'm wondering since your career [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1496.64s)]
*  blew up does that make things easier or harder? Much much harder. Really? Much harder. Yes of [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1503.68s)]
*  course because I've always been someone who's put an immense amount of pressure on myself but [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1510.0s)]
*  it's a bit different when you can't really walk outside without expecting to be pointed at or [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1516.16s)]
*  it's kind of died down now but still I walk into a room and I am looking at everything differently. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1524.64s)]
*  I know that my position as a public figure has changed immensely and I was a private person and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1533.28s)]
*  I prefer to be a private person so I think understanding that there's a lot more eyes and [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1542.72s)]
*  a lot more people watching and I'm so underdeveloped. My prefrontal cortex isn't even [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1548.16s)]
*  fully there yet technically. I want to be making the mistakes and learning from them and falling [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1553.68s)]
*  on my face and maybe the opposite. I want to be extremely confident and try everything and do [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1560.64s)]
*  everything and be the biggest risk taker in the world. There's a lot more at stake now [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1565.44s)]
*  whether I like it or not and people are entirely entitled to share their opinion and [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1570.72s)]
*  even when maybe it's not the most welcome but I think it's just kind of [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1577.44s)]
*  sorry I'm trying to think of the best way to to phrase this or put this [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  in a way that is still refreshing but you don't have to just say it in the way that you feel it. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1587.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah it's really scary actually and it's hard to say that because also you can't complain. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1593.52s)]
*  I wanted this when I was a child. I live such a privileged life. I'm so lucky to do the things [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1604.0s)]
*  that I do. I love my job. I don't see myself wanting to stop my job. There are certain things [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1608.8s)]
*  that no one can really prepare you for though and that kind of attention is one of them. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1616.8s)]
*  How do you protect yourself? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1624.08s)]
*  This is terrible to say because I think my publicist might be listening to this [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1626.08s)]
*  but I do avoid the phone as much as I can. I'm always walking. If you're ever wondering [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1631.76s)]
*  what I'm doing, if my parents are ever wondering, if I'm not at work, I'm not on some sort of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1638.32s)]
*  meeting, I am outside doing laps, I'm in a random garden, I am laying taking a nap in a field, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1643.84s)]
*  I hope your publicist likes that. That's beautiful. I know that's what she likes. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1653.28s)]
*  I hope your parents feel the same. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1657.6s)]
*  Except when you're trying to book this second phone call to catch up and it's like, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  oh man, where did Jenna go? She can't get a hold of me. I guess that's maybe how I protect myself. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1661.92s)]
*  I think it's really easy for, again, maybe I'm like my mom in a lot of ways where maybe I operate out [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1669.6s)]
*  of fear sometimes and I try not to be that way. I think I've actually relaxed a lot in recent years [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1674.56s)]
*  because I've given up and I don't mean that in a sad way. I mean that in the most liberating way [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1680.64s)]
*  possible. I think I'm really working on not being so self-critical or just killing myself over things [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1690.16s)]
*  that in the grand scheme of the world with the news and things you see, it's really just not [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1698.48s)]
*  important at all. I should be having so much fun right now. So much fun. And I don't and I should. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1705.36s)]
*  And I try to remind myself of that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  Jenna, thank you so much. And I hope you will pick up the phone when I call you again. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1714.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I will for you. That's only because I like you and I like your daughter. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1720.3999999999999s)]
*  After the break, I called Jenna back to talk to her about her new friend. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  After the break, I called Jenna back to talk more about the pressures of growing up in public. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1731.52s)]
*  I don't like to mess up. I do it all the time and it's embarrassing. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1736.56s)]
*  Hi. Hello. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1757.6s)]
*  How you been? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1760.08s)]
*  I've been good. I've been very good. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1761.04s)]
*  Busy? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1763.76s)]
*  Busy. Last week was chaos, but I had, it was being holiday here in Ireland. So [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1764.6399999999999s)]
*  me and my friends went to the north of Ireland for the three days and just swam in the sea and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1771.84s)]
*  slept and ate and went on hikes. It was perfect. It was just what I needed right before this big, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1780.08s)]
*  crazy press tour. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1786.1599999999999s)]
*  So when we ended our conversation last week, it was a little bit of a somber note. And [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  I was thinking about the tension of being a young person and being famous. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  And you seem like quite a private person who really needs to kind of guard that privacy. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1802.1599999999999s)]
*  But then there's also this desire for you to be this public person, to answer questions, to [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1807.9199999999998s)]
*  have all these people look up to you and want things from you. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1816.24s)]
*  And I was wondering how you, at 21, figure how much of yourself to share? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. Hmm. Well, something that I want to make very clear is while I am an actor and while [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1828.24s)]
*  that sort of attention, it is so heavy and it is so intense, but oftentimes you get the, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1833.52s)]
*  oh, well, you should expect it. Oh, well, now you're complaining. Oh, well, why don't you do [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1839.76s)]
*  this instead? Or why don't you stop? And which is true. You could say that, but I think what [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1844.96s)]
*  I'm trying to say when I say that is not that I'm ungrateful, but more so that you can expect [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1849.3600000000001s)]
*  something and try to prepare yourself for something as best you can. But you just don't know until you [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  go through it. It's the same thing about, oh, I could easily drive a car. When you're a kid, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1860.0s)]
*  you think, oh, that's easy. Yeah. I'll look so cool. I'll do it with one hand. I'll do it with [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1864.56s)]
*  my knees. And then you get behind a car and it's terrifying. But for the most part, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1868.88s)]
*  like I'm 21. So also don't, I can't be expected to go out there and be a philosopher or be some, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1874.4s)]
*  you know, almighty being because yeah, I'm a 21 year old kid. And I think that's also [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1883.2s)]
*  probably important to remember. I remember my twenties being really, really hard because you [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1887.68s)]
*  are leaving one stage of your life and going into another. And it felt really fraught and it felt [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1894.16s)]
*  really uncomfortable a lot of the time. You're becoming an adult. And I was thinking about you [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1900.4s)]
*  having to do that in the public eye. I mean, does it feel scary? Of course it feels scary. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1905.76s)]
*  It feels scary regardless. I get scared when I wake up, you know, I don't know what to do with [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1912.0s)]
*  myself. And there's a big part of me that's frustrated by it because people reflect on [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  twenties like some beautiful time, which I can't speak for everyone. Obviously some people may have [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  had an incredible time. Some people may have had a shitty time. And what I find most is, you know, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1926.72s)]
*  it's, it's that thing where, you know, you can't appreciate where you're at right now. So you look [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1932.8s)]
*  back on things and you go, Oh man, the twenties, that was such a good time. You know, I was young, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1937.28s)]
*  I was beautiful. I, you know, it was the best I had ever looked and this and that, whatever you [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1941.84s)]
*  want to say, but ultimately, no, you were terrified. I know you were because that's what I'm going [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1945.84s)]
*  through right now. And there's no way that you're learning how to pay bills for the first time and [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1950.88s)]
*  dealing with taxes and being expected to be an adult and not be scared shitless. That's, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1956.24s)]
*  it's just a given. So maybe there's something exciting about that, but no, it's not nice because [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1964.4s)]
*  I don't like to mess up. I do it all the time and it's embarrassing. What does messing up mean to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1970.96s)]
*  you? To me, it's really frustrating when I don't communicate the way that I intend to, or I'm not [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1977.44s)]
*  able to, you know, fix a situation, uh, could be in my control, could not be in my control. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1984.48s)]
*  I feel really, really bad when I can't manage to do what I feel to be simple things. It, like, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1991.44s)]
*  it could be anything I could. You're a perfectionist. Do you think like you just always, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=1997.68s)]
*  I can't even call myself that, but my family and friends do. It's just, you know, everything, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2002.48s)]
*  everything is, everything could be better. I could be doing everything better. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2010.3200000000002s)]
*  So I'm thinking about you trying to be the best representation of whatever it is [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2015.2800000000002s)]
*  or not offending people. And there was something that you said in a recent interview about the [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2019.92s)]
*  expectations on you as a representative of your culture. As a Latina, it made me upset that there's [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2025.68s)]
*  this idea that there's one way to be Latino. And I wondered how you deal with that, you know, trying [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2031.92s)]
*  to represent an entire community, but also feeling like maybe you can't represent an entire [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2038.48s)]
*  community. It's very clear. I'm not going to satisfy everybody. And there's a lot of pressure, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2043.84s)]
*  but I've learned to make it less of a external pressure and more of an internal, our culture, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2049.76s)]
*  my culture, my Mexican and Puerto Rican heritage. It's so beautiful. The stories to come from it [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2056.0s)]
*  are amazing. I have so many incredible relatives and just insane, surreal experiences that, you [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2062.8s)]
*  know, I've heard and have been passed down and I want to be as close to that as possible. I do want [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2070.32s)]
*  to speak Spanish. I do, you know, I want to be more connected to my culture. The difference is [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2074.8s)]
*  now I want to do that for me and not for other people, which I think is incredibly important, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2081.84s)]
*  making that distinction and being aware of it. I mean, when you say you want to do it for you and [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2087.04s)]
*  connect more for yourself, what does that entail? What does that look like? Well, I have, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2091.6s)]
*  my tia Emma is really, really important to me. She's kind of a grandmother to me. You know, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  she's, lives with my mom now. And I think it's really important that because I'm seeing her so [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  much more often, I want to be able to connect with her as much as I possibly can. And part of that is, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2111.68s)]
*  I think, would be being able to connect with her in her native tongue. So when I go home, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2116.0s)]
*  I want to be able to have all those conversations with her and have that intimacy because I love [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2122.56s)]
*  her so much. And now with, you know, how close she is, I want to be even closer. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2129.28s)]
*  So you're learning Spanish? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2133.76s)]
*  Yes. I mean, I am, but also simultaneously I'm not. I find myself doing the thing where I pick [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2135.36s)]
*  it up and then I put it down, pick it up and then I put it down, which is hard with my job [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2144.32s)]
*  because it's so much studying. But 100% I watch videos in Spanish. I read articles in Spanish. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2147.1200000000003s)]
*  I do all of that because I think it's best to kind of keep myself aware and up to date and make sure [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2153.36s)]
*  that I can figure things out. If I spoke Spanish to you, would my grammar be all over the place? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2159.04s)]
*  100%. Would my tia Emma make fun of me? Of course she would. But I think she would also be charmed [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2164.56s)]
*  by the fact that I was trying. And if that brings her joy, of course I'm going to try. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2170.64s)]
*  That's what matters. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2177.12s)]
*  Few more questions. One of your next big projects is an adaptation of the Ishiguro novel, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2179.68s)]
*  Clara and the Sun. It's a sci-fi story. You are playing a robot. Why did you want to go do that? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2185.7599999999998s)]
*  I had a really great meeting with Taiko Itt. And he tends to work with a lot of his friends [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  and family. So the environment is really safe and comfortable. The character Clara, what he had in [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2199.92s)]
*  mind for her is she's artificial intelligence. And she's basically bought by this mother to befriend [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2206.16s)]
*  young girl who's dying. She's sick. I knew that Clara had just a pure, completely innocent, untainted [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2214.32s)]
*  optimism about her that you can't find in a person. Not a person of that age. Eventually you get older [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2223.76s)]
*  and you're a bit jaded or a bit scarred by certain things. You've learned a lot. You've [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2229.6s)]
*  maybe built a bit more of a wall. Clara didn't have that wall, which is the complete opposite of [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2234.24s)]
*  a lot of the other characters I play where they hide who they are or they don't want their emotion [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2241.04s)]
*  to be seen. I just felt like it was a good place to be vulnerable and try something new. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2246.16s)]
*  What do you think of AI? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2254.24s)]
*  I hate AI. I mean, here's the thing. Here's the thing. AI could be used for incredible things. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2255.9199999999996s)]
*  I think I saw something the other day where they were saying that artificial intelligence was able [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2262.56s)]
*  to detect breast cancer four years before it progressed. That's beautiful. Let's keep it to [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2266.72s)]
*  that. Did I like being 14 and making a Twitter account because I was supposed to and seeing [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2274.24s)]
*  dirty edited content of me as a child? No. It's terrifying. It's corrupt. It's wrong. It's disgusting. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2281.68s)]
*  Here's the problem though. We've opened Pandora's box. Well, it is what it is. It's out there now. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  We're going to have to deal with the consequences. I would like it to be used with good intent, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2296.0s)]
*  but we could say that about anything and everything. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2300.96s)]
*  You saw AI images of you, generated images of you as a child. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  As a child, like pornographic ones? Yes, of course. Actually, the first DM that I ever [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2310.48s)]
*  opened myself when I was 12 was an unsolicited photo of a man's genitals. That was just the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2317.52s)]
*  beginning of what was to come. I used to have that Twitter account and I was told that, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2325.2s)]
*  oh, you got to do it. You got to build your image. I ended up deleting it about two, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2332.24s)]
*  three years ago because the influx after the show had come out of these absurd images [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2335.84s)]
*  and photos were just so repulsive. I already was in a confused state that [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2345.2000000000003s)]
*  I just deleted it because it was unnecessary and I didn't need that. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2349.52s)]
*  I just can't imagine how disturbing that must have been. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2353.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. On Twitter, I would make political statements or just personal ones or just [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2355.76s)]
*  talk about excitement for jobs and then I was graded with this stuff and it was just disgusting [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2362.16s)]
*  and it made me feel bad. It made me feel uncomfortable. It's awful and it's... Anyway, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2366.72s)]
*  that's why, yeah, I deleted it because I couldn't say anything without saying something like that [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  and I don't need to be saying that every day. One day I just woke up and I thought, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2378.3999999999996s)]
*  oh, I don't need this anymore. So I dropped it. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2382.64s)]
*  I guess you've learned how to protect yourself or are learning. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2387.6s)]
*  I'm learning. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2391.6s)]
*  And I guess just in the bigger picture, how would you describe this moment at 21 when you have been [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2394.32s)]
*  exposed to so much already? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2403.2s)]
*  I'm just navigating. I think I'm exploring. I'm on this sort of personal expedition, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2405.84s)]
*  I guess is the best way that I could put it. I'm on my own little personal expedition. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2412.8s)]
*  So you're turning 22 at the end of September. Any plans? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2417.52s)]
*  Not at all. Probably work. I have spent every single birthday of mine since I was 11 [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  on set except for my 21st. That was the first time in 10 years that I had not been on set [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2428.88s)]
*  on my birthday. So I've never been big on birthdays and I'm back at work this time. So [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2433.2799999999997s)]
*  nothing crazy planned. I am probably just going to want to sleep. That's it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  That's Jenna Ortega. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is in theaters nationwide starting September 6th. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hteoXwYCIhA&t=2444.72s)]
