*  What? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh boy, oh boy. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=1.0s)]
*  Would make you feel... [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=2.0s)]
*  Oh boy, I didn't like the way you said the word what there. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=3.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=7.0s)]
*  What do you think you're doing? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=8.0s)]
*  What do you have planned over the next five years? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=10.36s)]
*  Because I'd take any dream trips right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=12.6s)]
*  Did you want to visit the Starship Mahal? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=15.16s)]
*  You should go. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=18.56s)]
*  You should go now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=19.56s)]
*  I do not think you should go now, but I am curious, what would make you feel done with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=20.56s)]
*  the show? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=26.32s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=27.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=29.4s)]
*  I've seen, I guess I worked with Jon Stewart for a long time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=30.4s)]
*  I saw him get exhausted. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=33.6s)]
*  So I know what that looks like. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=36.36s)]
*  I saw him reckoning with the fact, oh I don't know if I can do this in another... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=39.96s)]
*  I've done this in every possible way that I can do it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And he was right about that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Like, can't really do it any better. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  I've not hit that point yet. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=53.32s)]
*  I still absolutely love making the show. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOtKks8NCzE&t=55.52s)]
