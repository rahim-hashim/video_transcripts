# How Emotionally Immature Parents Can Weaponize Compassion
**New York Times - The Interview:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw)
*  I'm not sure quite how to bring this up, but it's sort of to do with like where compassion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=0.0s)]
*  for the sort of harmful person fits into all of this, because I'll use a personal example. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=7.36s)]
*  So I have a very distant relationship with my biological father. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=13.96s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of pain there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=18.92s)]
*  I, you know, I honestly have seen him twice in the last 20 years. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=21.6s)]
*  I don't think that it really is showing sort of the best side of who I am. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=26.6s)]
*  I think somebody who's more developed and more compassionate would probably figure out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=32.08s)]
*  a way to have a relationship that isn't so distant. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=37.68s)]
*  How do we think of the idea of compassion in this kind of example? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=46.24s)]
*  Yeah, for emotionally immature people, your compassion will be weaponized because their [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=53.08s)]
*  egocentrism makes them determined to be the innocent party, for them to be the victim, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  and for you to put aside your needs in order to meet theirs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=72.64s)]
*  That's the deal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=77.08s)]
*  The emotionally immature person will always frame a situation that you are not being sympathetic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=78.16s)]
*  enough, compassionate enough, seeing it from their point of view, being sensitive enough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=85.08s)]
*  So when I'm working with people who've been raised by people like this, I am always very [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=91.88s)]
*  careful about pushing for any kind of compassion, forgiveness, any of those things that say, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=99.28s)]
*  well, even though you have treated me badly, even though you have invalidated me and made [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=109.6s)]
*  me feel bad about myself, even though you have tried to control me and manipulate my [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=116.92s)]
*  emotions, I'm going to be empathic and feel for you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=123.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that's a moral high ground. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyPSbePQcw&t=129.6s)]
