# Pete Buttigieg thinks a victory for Harris might loosen Trumpâ€™s grip on the G.O.P. | The Interview
**New York Times - The Interview:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo)
*  Part of the promise of a Kamala Harris presidency is actually the prospect of a comparatively [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=0.0s)]
*  normal Republican party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=5.76s)]
*  What I mean by that is, you know, beating Donald Trump the first time in 2020 ended [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=8.16s)]
*  his term, but it did not end his grip on the GOP. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=13.72s)]
*  Beating him twice would, I think, have a different effect on a lot of people in the GOP who know [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=17.36s)]
*  better than to be on board with him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=22.38s)]
*  He goes against their values, too, not just my values, but they've gone along with it [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=23.68s)]
*  because they think it's the path to power. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=27.0s)]
*  And it would become abundantly clear that that is not true if we beat him not just the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=29.6s)]
*  way we beat him in 2020, not just the way we indirectly beat him in 2022 in the midterms, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=33.6s)]
*  but beat him a second or so to speak, third time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=38.6s)]
*  And we will always have fierce and meaningful disagreements between Democrats and Republicans, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=43.2s)]
*  but there's a chance of that difference, those debates being a little less ugly or, to put [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=48.42s)]
*  it another way, a little less weird. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKdJ-kpMUSo&t=56.6s)]
