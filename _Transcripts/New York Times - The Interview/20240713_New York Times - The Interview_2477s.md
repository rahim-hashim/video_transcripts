# 'The Interview': Robert Putnam Knows Why You’re Lonely
**New York Times - The Interview:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This isn't going to come as a news flash. Things feel fragile in America. And there [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=9.48s)]
*  is a broad consensus across parties and demographics that we are struggling to come together and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=15.36s)]
*  face our many challenges. Which is why, when I heard about a new documentary about the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=22.0s)]
*  Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, I knew I wanted to talk to him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=27.28s)]
*  Nearly three decades ago, Putnam became something pretty rare. A celebrity academic. In 1995, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=32.52s)]
*  he published a groundbreaking paper called Bowling Alone, America's Declining Social [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=39.52s)]
*  Capital. In it, he used data from the previous few decades to prove that America was transforming [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  from a nation of joiners to a nation of loners. We were going to church less, joining clubs [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=51.32s)]
*  at declining rates. And he warned that as a result, we were losing trust in our fellow [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=57.24s)]
*  Americans and our institutions. That paper caught the attention of then President Bill [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=62.52s)]
*  Clinton and before long, regular people couldn't stop talking about it either. Putnam expanded [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=68.48s)]
*  it into a bestselling book a few years later. And for a moment, it seemed like his work [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  might pull us back from this isolation highway we were all on. We all know how that story [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=79.6s)]
*  Putnam's now 83. And he's watched as we've become more divided, more lonely, and less [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  confident about the way forward than ever before, even as the stakes only get higher. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=92.88s)]
*  Here's my conversation with Robert Putnam. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=99.88s)]
*  Dr. Putnam, your work is all about connection. So I'm wondering first, can you describe your [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=102.88s)]
*  own social life? I mean, what clubs are you in? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=116.92s)]
*  That's a really embarrassing question. I write about and talk about the importance of connections [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  of social capital, which is my jargon for connections and trust and so on. But my wife [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=127.76s)]
*  actually does it. She is actually the one who joins everything, who has been a tutor [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=133.24s)]
*  and a teacher and a terrific mother and an even better grandmother. We've got two kids [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=139.24s)]
*  and seven grandchildren. And in the long run, her work is going to have a longer half-life [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  than mine. I'm not just being modest because those kids are going to be around long after [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=151.76s)]
*  people have forgotten anything about this Putnam, the writer and author. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=157.4s)]
*  So that's a long way of saying not many clubs, am I right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=161.8s)]
*  Right. When I was a kid, I joined everything. There's a picture of my high school yearbook [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=165.84s)]
*  and basically there's nothing in my high school that I did not join, band and chorus and debate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=170.76s)]
*  and even football and on and on. But as I've gotten older, it's hard to go to club meetings [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=174.8s)]
*  when you're on the road all the time. And I am. That's the sad fact. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=182.28s)]
*  That's interesting to me because you're grappling with, I think, something that we all grapple [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=187.56s)]
*  with, which is how harried our lives are, how hard it is to actually find a meaningful [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  connection. And a big part of why I was interested in having this conversation with you is that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to social connection, things feel bad right now. Do things feel bad to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  you too? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, sure. I think we're at a really important turning point in American history. Of course, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=215.48s)]
*  American history is full of turning points, but this is a pretty important one. What I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=222.76s)]
*  wrote in Bowling Alone is even more relevant now. Why? Because what we've seen over the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  last 25 years since the book was published is a deepening and intensifying of that trend. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=231.96s)]
*  We've become more socially isolated and we can see it in every facet of our lives. We [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=238.88s)]
*  can see it in the Surgeon General's talk about loneliness. And he's been talking about it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=243.56s)]
*  relatively recently and he's talking about the psychological state of being lonely. That's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=249.4s)]
*  in Bowling Alone, the fact that people were becoming more and more socially isolated. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  And the social isolation leads to lots of bad things. We're seeing it right now. Let [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=258.84s)]
*  me give you a particular example. Social isolation is really bad. Well, it's bad for your health. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=264.56s)]
*  That's part of the story of the book. But it's really bad for the country because people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=272.14s)]
*  who are isolated, and especially young men who are isolated, are vulnerable to the appeals [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=276.12s)]
*  of some false community. That was true, and I can cite chapter and verse on this. Eager [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=283.16s)]
*  recruits to the Nazi party in the 1930s were lonely, young, German men. And it's not an [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=289.46s)]
*  accident that the people who are most attractive today to white nationalist violence are lonely, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=297.88s)]
*  young, white men. Loneliness is bad for your health, but it's also bad for the health of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=305.4s)]
*  the people around you. Does that make sense? It does. I want to understand a little bit [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=312.16s)]
*  about the terms that you use for how you describe this. You distinguish between two types of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=317.8s)]
*  social capital, right? There's bonding social capital and there's bridging social capital. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=324.68s)]
*  Exactly. Can you explain that distinction? Sure. Ties that link you to people like yourself [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=329.48s)]
*  are called bonding social capital. That's just the way the word is used. So my ties [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=336.88s)]
*  to other elderly male, white, Jewish professors, that's my bonding social capital. And bridging [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=343.16s)]
*  social capital are your ties to people unlike yourself. So my ties to people of a different [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=352.92s)]
*  generation or a different gender or a different religion or a different politics or whatever, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=358.16s)]
*  that's my bridging social capital. I'm not saying bridging good, bonding bad, because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=364.08s)]
*  if you get sick, the people who bring you chicken soup are likely to reflect your bonding [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  social capital. But I am saying that in a diverse society like ours, we need a lot of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=376.56s)]
*  bridging social capital. And some forms of bonding social capital are really awful. So [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=385.7s)]
*  the KKK is pure social capital. Bonding social capital can be very useful, but it can also [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=392.12s)]
*  be extremely dangerous. So far so good, except that bridging social capital is harder to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=397.92s)]
*  build than bonding social capital. But basically, that's the challenge as I see it of America [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=404.96s)]
*  today. There's a lot more to say about it, but the basic challenge is we need a lot more [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=410.76s)]
*  bridging social capital, and that's hard to do. And that's especially true in politics. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=414.68s)]
*  Yeah, we'll get to politics, but I actually want to start by talking about individual [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  connections. You know, in preparation for this interview, I talked to a lot of people [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=425.12s)]
*  about social isolation. My 33-year-old niece feels it. My nearly 60-year-old sister feels [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=431.56s)]
*  it. I feel it. People think that they've lost the ability to connect. Twenty-four years [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  ago, you placed a lot of blame on television. Nowadays, many people place the blame on phones, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=446.32s)]
*  although maybe that's too simplistic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, let me go back originally. At the time I wrote Bowling Alone, social media was still [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  six or seven years in the future. I did speculate a little bit about social media, because I [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  didn't guess that, but about the internet. I did speculate a little bit, and as it happens, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  my speculations about the effects of the internet turned out to be approximately right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=472.76s)]
*  And it's now a quite common idea that social media are to blame for all of our troubles. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=479.12s)]
*  And I think that's a lot true, although even now I don't think we should exculpate television. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=485.58s)]
*  There was a recent Nielsen report which said that on average, the typical adult spends [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=495.26s)]
*  more than 10 hours each day with media. Okay, 10 hours every day. Think of that. But about [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=501.16s)]
*  half of that is still devoted to television. So even now, even long after the invention [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  of the internet and social media and the iPhone and so on, television still has that effect [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=514.08s)]
*  of privatizing our leisure time. That's the fundamental thing it does. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. We're not interacting face-to-face with a real person. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=523.72s)]
*  And one really important question that I don't think we really know is, what is it about [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=528.24s)]
*  face-to-faceness that matters so much? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=533.12s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=536.44s)]
*  Face-to-faceness matters. There's no doubt about that. And why it matters, I don't know. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=537.44s)]
*  Nobody knows. But I want to add one more thing, because to have that as a dichotomy, which [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=541.84s)]
*  most discussions of this have, is it better to do Facebook or better to go bowling on [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=545.96s)]
*  a team, that kind of issue, that is not the right way to think about the problem. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=551.28s)]
*  What is? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=557.68s)]
*  I want to use an analogy here with the concept of alloy. An alloy is a mixture of two different [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=558.68s)]
*  metals but mixing them together has unique characteristics. Today, almost all of our [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=566.2199999999999s)]
*  social connections are simultaneously face-to-face and virtual. Our social ties are all alloys. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=572.68s)]
*  My wife and I, for example, we have offices just next door, but often we send emails [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=583.32s)]
*  to each other. How weird is that? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  I text my husband all the time, even if we're in the same house. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=591.2s)]
*  Exactly. Well, it turns out that's not peculiar to your marriage or my marriage. That's extremely [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=594.08s)]
*  common that our most intensive personal face-to-face ties are also the people with whom we interact [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=599.32s)]
*  virtually, most of the time. So there are ways in which we could combine face-to-face [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=605.72s)]
*  and internet that would be really productive. We could develop social media in a way that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=612.44s)]
*  they would actually contribute to our lives, our personal lives and our collective lives. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  But it would be a little less profitable. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=626.0400000000001s)]
*  Let me take this idea a little further because as we've been talking, there's been two sort [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=627.88s)]
*  of ideas that are in tension here. One idea is that face-to-face is better. You've said [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=634.0s)]
*  we definitely experienced it during the pandemic. We know it. We are social animals. We need [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=641.92s)]
*  to see each other. And the other side is that you're texting your wife and I'm texting my [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  husband, even though we're in the same house. We want community, and yet there's something [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=653.92s)]
*  that takes us away from community. Why? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=661.56s)]
*  There are two ways of answering that question. The first answer is we're busy. And you might [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=664.8s)]
*  think therefore busy people are going to be more online and less face-to-face. But here's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=673.9599999999999s)]
*  what's complicated about that theory. Actually, when we look, and in bowling alone I did this very, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  very carefully, we look to see who is a joiner and who is not a joiner, who connects in real [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=689.32s)]
*  life, bowling leagues or Kiwanis or women's reading groups or whatever. And I compared that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  to how busy they were. And the fact is busy people are more connected with the rest of the world. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=702.84s)]
*  So there are, I don't like to use pejorative language, but there are some sloths among us [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  who don't connect face-to-face and also don't connect. They just sit in front of the television. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  And there are other people who are very busy but nevertheless manage to connect with a lot of people, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=719.36s)]
*  both face-to-face and during the media. So it's basically, if you're asking why do we have people [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  no longer connecting face-to-face, it absolutely is not because we're too busy. So then what is it? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, so I know you ask an academic a simple question and they answer with an encyclopedia. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  And the next thing that academics always do is cite their most recent book. So that's what I'm [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=747.2s)]
*  going to do. My most recent book is called The Upswing. I wrote it jointly with a brilliant [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=751.48s)]
*  young woman named Shailen Romney Garrett. We looked at long run trends, trends for example, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=757.0s)]
*  in social capital, that is trends in connectedness, trends in loneliness, that sort of thing, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=764.48s)]
*  over the last 125 years. And the short version is that curve, it's an upside down U-curve. We were [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=768.36s)]
*  socially isolated and distrustful in the early 1900s. But then there was a turning point and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=776.12s)]
*  then we had a long upswing from roughly 1900 or 1910 till roughly 1965. And that was the peak of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=783.6s)]
*  our social capital. That is, people were more trusting then, they were more connected then, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=790.64s)]
*  they were more likely to be married then, they were more likely to join clubs then, etc. And [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  then for the next 50 years, that trend turned around. And the book-balling alone looked at [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=799.96s)]
*  that single trend. But this new book not only extends the length of time of looking at these [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=805.24s)]
*  things, but also looks at three other variables. First, political polarization. That trend in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=810.24s)]
*  political polarization or depolarization follows the same pattern exactly that the trends in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=816.4s)]
*  social connectedness follow. That is, low in the beginning of the 20th century, high in the 60s, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=822.52s)]
*  and then plunging to where we are now. So we now have a very politically polarized country, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  just as we did 125 years ago. The next dimension is inequality. America was very unequal in what [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=833.68s)]
*  was called the Gilded Age in the 1890s and 1900s. But then that turned around and the level of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=840.4799999999999s)]
*  equality in America went up until the middle 60s. In the middle 60s, it's hard to believe this, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  in the middle 60s, America was more equal economically than socialist Sweden. And then [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=850.68s)]
*  beginning in 1965, that turns around and plunged and now we're back down to where we were. We're [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=856.68s)]
*  in a second Gilded Age. And the third variable that we look at is harder to discuss and measure, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=861.64s)]
*  but it's sort of cultural. To what extent do we think we're all in this together or to what [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  sense do we think it's every man for himself or every man and woman for himself? And that has [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=873.24s)]
*  exactly the same trend. Pause. What caused that? I am trying to get to the issues of causation, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  because it turns out to be morality, according to my reading of this evidence. What stands upstream [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=884.0s)]
*  of all these other trends is morality, a sense that we're all in this together and that we have [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=892.88s)]
*  obligations to other people. Now, suddenly I'm no longer the social scientist, I'm a preacher. I'm [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=898.04s)]
*  trying to say, we're not going to fix all these problems in America, polarization, inequality, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=904.4s)]
*  social isolation, until first of all, we start feeling we have an obligation to care for other [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=910.16s)]
*  people. And that's not easy. So don't ask me how to do that. That is a very hard thing to reverse, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=916.6s)]
*  this idea that we're not all in this together. This idea that we're not rowing the same way. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=924.4399999999999s)]
*  And I'm hearing you enumerate all these different things that are behind it, polarization, etc., [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=929.9599999999999s)]
*  what though makes this a uniquely American problem? Because we look at other countries [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=937.96s)]
*  that have similar financial and economic and political systems, and they don't suffer as [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=946.28s)]
*  acutely at this moment, as we do from these things. Can I take issue with the framing of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=954.9200000000001s)]
*  the question? You say, why are we among all nations, prone to or uniquely afflicted? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=960.48s)]
*  Uniquely afflicted. And we're not. That's my short answer. Now I have to spell. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=968.2s)]
*  But we are. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=972.32s)]
*  No, we're not. First of all, a little bit about the empirical data today. America is polarized, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=973.12s)]
*  so is France, so is Hungary, so is Canada. It's hard to name an advanced industrial democracy [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=979.96s)]
*  in which there's not really deep, I mean, seriously deep political polarization. And [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  if you'll allow me to get a little political, Trump-like figures in all of those countries. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=997.2s)]
*  Okay, how about economic inequality? The degree to which we're unequal, it's true, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1001.88s)]
*  is probably higher in America than anywhere else. But the trend in inequality, that is the growth [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1008.88s)]
*  of inequality over the last 35, 40 years, is completely non-unique to America. Okay, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  how about social isolation? There was a lot of debate once upon a time when [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1021.4s)]
*  bowling alone first came out. People said, well, true in America, but it's not true here. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  But then there was a second wave, and almost everybody agrees that there has been in their [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1028.12s)]
*  country in the last 30 or 40 years, a growth in social isolation and loneliness. And indeed, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1035.76s)]
*  some places have the government department of loneliness. I'm not even joking. Okay, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1041.36s)]
*  now how about is America uniquely individualistic? There was a guy who wandered around, a Frenchman [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1047.36s)]
*  actually, who wandered around America in the 1830s, a guy named Alexis de Tocqueville. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1053.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1059.36s)]
*  He wandered America in 1831 all over the country. And he came away thinking the most interesting [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1060.28s)]
*  thing about America that he discovered was that it was incredibly communal. And he didn't know [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1066.76s)]
*  the word social capital, too bad for him, but he was talking about joining. People were always [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1073.64s)]
*  joining. However, he talked about, really incessantly, about how Americans were individualists. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, how do you reconcile those two points? Is America individualistic or are we communitarian? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1084.52s)]
*  He, in effect, said there are ways in which Americans are both, and we even have a secret. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1091.48s)]
*  He said, this is the secret to America. It's called self-interest rightly understood. And he said, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1099.24s)]
*  it's because Americans, they do pursue their self-interest, but they think about it in the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1107.0s)]
*  long-term. They think about, well, in the short run, maybe I can gain by cheating somebody, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1112.4s)]
*  but in the long run, that's bad for everybody. If everybody followed that practice, we'd be a [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1118.4s)]
*  poorer country. We're all better off if we all can cooperate. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1122.4s)]
*  It reminds me of something I've covered a lot of, natural disasters, among other things. And [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  studies have shown that neighborhoods that have strong connections recover much more quickly from [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  natural disasters than neighborhoods that don't. Exactly. The ones that have strong ties, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1141.76s)]
*  they do better. Absolutely. And I'm conscious of that. At this moment, I'm speaking to you from [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1147.92s)]
*  Cambridge, Mass., where we are lucky enough to have a very nice home right in Harvard Square, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1153.52s)]
*  but we also have a very nice home up in New Hampshire. And one of the reasons we like New [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1157.68s)]
*  Hampshire is because it happened purely by chance that the places we're living has the highest level [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1161.04s)]
*  of social capital in America. And I have got the data to show it. And what that means is [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1165.12s)]
*  that if a disaster happens, the power goes out, which happens all the time up in the woods, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1171.1200000000001s)]
*  people will help one another. Now, maybe they would do that in Cambridge. I don't know. But [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1175.2s)]
*  in Cambridge, you probably wait for the utility to fix the utility. But if there's a bad snowstorm, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1179.44s)]
*  our neighbors come to shovel us out because they think I'm too old to shovel the snow, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1184.88s)]
*  which is actually true. So I'm just reinforcing your idea that disasters require social capital. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1189.0400000000002s)]
*  Wait, wait, you own a house in the place with the most social capital in the United States. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1195.84s)]
*  Did that happen because you're there or you move there because it has social capital? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1200.8s)]
*  Well, here's correlation causation. I can show you the data that had social capital decades before [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1206.9599999999998s)]
*  I got there. No, no, it's the other way around. I think I was attracted to Jaffrey is the name [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1211.52s)]
*  of this town. Well, partly because it's beautiful, actually. But I'm sure I was attracted to it [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1216.32s)]
*  without even at that point knowing it. Because you can feel community. I mean, you can [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1220.8s)]
*  be there not very long and you can feel that the neighbors are paying attention to you. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1226.32s)]
*  One of the first times I went there, I mean, I'm sorry, this is just a silly story, but I've [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1230.72s)]
*  went to the grocery store and they had different kinds of potato salad. And I asked the guy at the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1233.9199999999998s)]
*  counter, could I have some German potato salad? And he gave it to me and it was super. And the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1242.08s)]
*  next week I came back and I ordered a different kind of potato salad because I thought, well, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1248.4s)]
*  maybe try something different. He said, what, you didn't like the German potato salad I gave [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1253.6000000000001s)]
*  you last week? I'm a total stranger and he's paying attention to my taste in potato salad. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1257.92s)]
*  So I'd imagine that people do come to you a lot asking for solutions about how to feel less lonely [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1265.2800000000002s)]
*  on an individual level. And the thesis of this new documentary about your life is join a club. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1272.16s)]
*  But how does having fun in a running club, for example, translate to democracy with a big D? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1278.8000000000002s)]
*  How does that small germ of social connection in a club then translate to, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1288.16s)]
*  I believe in this whole experiment that we are living in? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1295.44s)]
*  My work and this movie is designed to show you how it is that joining a club, even a trivial, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1299.44s)]
*  you know, a pinnacle club or whatever, tiddlywigs, does help democracy. That's what my work is [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  designed to show. The reason that that's true is because it's only by connecting with other people [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1312.3200000000002s)]
*  we generalize from our experience. I mean, in the running club, you learn that you can trust other [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1320.5600000000002s)]
*  people and learn in a way how you need to do to maintain that trust. The idea is that you're [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  running with someone, you learn that you can care for people and people can care for you, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1333.92s)]
*  even people that are different. And therefore, you're more likely to then trust that government [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1338.72s)]
*  and institutions are actually working to help you too. Yes, but I would say that the causal [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1345.44s)]
*  sequence is you begin with trusting other people. And the trusting in other people produces a [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1352.4s)]
*  government that's trustworthy. The virtue here is not trust, it's trustworthiness. I'm talking [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1359.28s)]
*  especially about government. That's not like a silly difference. But trust without trustworthiness [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1366.48s)]
*  is just gullibility. I'm not an advocate of pure blind trust. I'm an advocate of trustworthiness. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1373.84s)]
*  I want other people to be trustworthy of my trust, and I want the government to be trustworthy. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1382.8s)]
*  Does it matter what kind of a club you join? Is there a tension between what might be more [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  enjoyable for you and what might be better in terms of saving American democracy? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1397.6s)]
*  Of course, that's a tough question. I'm not sure I have any answer to it. It's got to be fun. I mean, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  building social capital is not like castor oil. You've got to take it because it's good for you, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1413.12s)]
*  even though it feels awful. People don't join things unless they're fun. So I am famous as [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1418.08s)]
*  the advocate of bowling clubs, but you don't bowl so you can build a better community. You bowl [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1425.12s)]
*  because it's fun. And in the doing of the bowling, in a team, I mean, you're hanging out with folks [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1431.76s)]
*  and you're talking about the latest TV show that you saw, or that occasionally you might talk about [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1437.36s)]
*  garbage pickup in town. And that's democracy. I mean, doing democracy doesn't just mean, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1445.6s)]
*  of course it means voting or it means organizing. I'm a political scientist, so I'm not opposed to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1451.04s)]
*  that. I'm just saying, don't think that the way to save democracy is just to set out to save democracy. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1455.12s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So this is top of mind, of course, because we are in an election year. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1460.88s)]
*  And this collective experience that we're all having of feeling disconnected and alone [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1467.6000000000001s)]
*  and angry and upset has bigger ramifications than just my own feeling of that. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1474.5600000000002s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER Absolutely, it does. Actually, I should say, even though I am a liberal Democrat, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  I've, much of my work has actually been supportive of and supported by people on the other side of [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1487.52s)]
*  the aisle. I mean, I have a track record of not being partisan, but I am on the issue of Trump [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1495.1999999999998s)]
*  because I think the MAGA movement is different. And why is it different? Well, partly because it [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1500.3999999999999s)]
*  doesn't do bridging social capital. I mean, that's part of my diagnosis. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1508.16s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK That's interesting. Let's talk about that. It doesn't do bridging social capital. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1512.16s)]
*  It does bonding social capital. It basically tries to find people that are like themselves [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  and exclude the other. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1524.16s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER And not only exclude the other, but vilify the other and glorify the fact that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1525.2s)]
*  it is bonding social capital. I mean, that captures the essence of the Trump movement, that they hate [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1530.88s)]
*  bridging social capital, and they love their bonding social capital. That is, they glorify [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  that they alone have the truth. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1542.4s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So what is the causality here? Are we politically polarized because we are [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1545.52s)]
*  less connected, or are we less connected because we are politically polarized? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1550.4s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER Yes. By that, I mean, life is not all one way cause and effect. And it is a vicious [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1554.24s)]
*  circle that we're caught in now. So what that means is any single strand, if we tried to fix [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1562.8s)]
*  one single strand, it wouldn't be enough because the other strands would work against that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1567.68s)]
*  I don't have any simple solutions to that. Sorry, did you invite me here because you thought I was [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  going to solve all of American problems? I don't solve American problems. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK I was hoping. I always told you were a sage. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1585.12s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER Okay, last question. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1589.52s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER And then I have one for you. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1593.2s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Okay. I'm just thinking about, in the documentary, actually, you sitting at the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1594.4s)]
*  table with President Clinton in the White House, and you must have felt at that moment like your [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1602.0s)]
*  message was going to be received. You must have felt so hopeful at that point. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1610.96s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER Sure. And in fact, I felt even more that way about Barack Obama. I mean, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1615.84s)]
*  I was incredibly hopeful about Barack Obama, not just because of who he was, but because I actually [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1621.52s)]
*  knew him well. Until he became president, he called me Bob and I called him Barack. He drew [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1625.6s)]
*  on my language in many of his speeches. LESLIE KENDRICK And yet, Dr. Putnam, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1631.04s)]
*  I hear you and your passion is so great. And I'm moved by it, frankly. But here we are. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  MARK S. LIEBER Yeah. So, I don't know. You shouldn't think I've never asked myself that [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1643.44s)]
*  question. In fact, one way to put it is this. Twenty-five years ago, I essentially predicted [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1650.8000000000002s)]
*  everything that was going to happen. That's a little exaggerated, but not much. And yet, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1658.88s)]
*  they happened. Okay, I've been a little bit of an Isaiah, preaching how awful things are. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1664.8000000000002s)]
*  Um, one person once said I was like an Old Testament prophet with charts. Um, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1670.4s)]
*  I've been working for actually most of my adult life, and maybe even longer than that, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1678.0800000000002s)]
*  to try to build a better, a more productive, more equal, more connected community in America. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1683.52s)]
*  And now I'm 83 and looking back, and it's been a total failure. Now, should I be optimistic or [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1690.72s)]
*  pessimistic about the future? I don't know that I'm optimistic or pessimistic. I could honestly, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1697.36s)]
*  looking at the polls today, I could be pretty pessimistic. But I am hopeful, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1705.28s)]
*  because I can see how we could change it. And I'm doing my damnedest, including right this moment, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1709.9199999999998s)]
*  to try to change the course of history. I'm sorry, that's very self-important, and I apologize for [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1715.84s)]
*  that. But I'm telling you honestly how I feel. I don't mean to sound cynical, it's just that what [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1722.48s)]
*  can I do? I've tried my damnedest to sketch a way forward, but I've not been persuasive enough. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1727.52s)]
*  Maybe it's just that one man can't do it alone. We need community. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1735.3600000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1740.88s)]
*  Well, what is your question? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1743.76s)]
*  If I'm right in examining your CV, you started your journalism career at the end of the 20th [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  century, roughly speaking, 2000, just about the time that Bowling Alone was released. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1754.7199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1759.28s)]
*  Suppose you didn't know me at all and didn't know the book, but you were trying to describe [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1759.84s)]
*  how you think American society or any of these societies you've studied have changed. I'm trying [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1764.7199999999998s)]
*  to turn you into not a social scientist, but neither am I a pure social scientist. What's changed? Better? Worse? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1772.16s)]
*  Can I call you Bob? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1786.08s)]
*  Well, there are two options. Bob or Your Excellency. So yes, Bob. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1788.32s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1793.84s)]
*  I came here in 2017 from having lived overseas, and the things that I had seen in other places [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1794.88s)]
*  that I had not seen here before, I started to see here. Families turning against each other, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1804.64s)]
*  friendships broken, politics invading every part of people's lives. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1812.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1819.36s)]
*  And that has only accelerated. And I think, like you say, to turn that around is a hard and Herculean task. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1820.1599999999999s)]
*  Actually, it's interesting that we have very different careers and origins and so on. But [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1832.72s)]
*  I have actually seen an America that was better. So I know it doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1841.04s)]
*  mean I know how to get out of here. But America as a whole has been in good times. We have [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1846.88s)]
*  trusted one another. That's what my books show. We've trusted one another. We've loved one another. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1852.64s)]
*  We've been equal to one another. We've voted for higher taxes on ourselves in order to help [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  poor Americans. We even began to reach across racial lines. I mean, it's not an accident that [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1864.16s)]
*  the Civil Rights Movement comes at the peak of this upswing. So I know that we can do better. And I [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1870.4s)]
*  know that we've turned corners in the past. I mean, we've come back from worse. So there's [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1875.84s)]
*  no question that you can turn a corner. But you asked me in my lifetime what I'd seen. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1881.12s)]
*  And I'm afraid the trajectory hasn't been on an upswing. And I think that's what your data shows, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1886.24s)]
*  too. Sure does. It's not just the vibes. I don't do vibes. I do data. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1892.24s)]
*  After the break, I called Bob back with a theory about why it's so hard to join a club these days. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1898.0s)]
*  Politics. But he's not so sure. Everybody who studies people's views agree most people are not [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1904.3999999999999s)]
*  interested in politics. Even now? Even now! [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1913.84s)]
*  Hello. Hi, Lulu. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm terrific. Are you at home? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1927.36s)]
*  I'm at home in New Hampshire. I'm looking down across our lawn to a pond. And then on the far [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1940.8799999999999s)]
*  side are trees. And beyond that is the tallest mountain between here and New York City. So yeah, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm in great shape. Thank you. It sounds beautiful. I'm jealous. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1952.96s)]
*  So I was thinking about our conversation. And what struck me is, to me, we feel less connected [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1958.56s)]
*  because it just feels like politics has changed since you started researching this. Our disagreements [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1969.44s)]
*  aren't just intellectual anymore about how we should pay taxes or how we should fund programs. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1975.52s)]
*  They feel fundamental and existential to many people. And the remedies that are being proposed, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1984.16s)]
*  like join a club, don't seem practical because people don't want to spend time with folks [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1989.84s)]
*  who seem to threaten their very way of life. There's a debate among academics about which [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=1994.72s)]
*  comes first, the elite polarizing us or the mass public polarizing? And there are debates about [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2002.08s)]
*  that, of course, but there's a strong argument, in my view, that this is top down. The reason [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2012.8s)]
*  people feel the way they do, that they don't want to hang out with people who differ from them, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  is because those are the messages they're getting from their political leaders. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2024.3999999999999s)]
*  And there are people who want to join clubs and they're really happy in those groups [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2027.76s)]
*  and they're not talking about politics. Most people in America don't care about politics. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2032.8s)]
*  That's sad for me to say as a political scientist, but that was the first discovery of empirical [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2037.92s)]
*  political science. And so by now, everybody who studies people's views agree most people [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2042.64s)]
*  are not interested in politics. Even now? Even now. If you ask people, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2052.24s)]
*  what are the things that you were worried about in your daily life, politics is bottom of the list. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2057.52s)]
*  Most people, they don't wake up in the morning thinking, oh, I wish I could stick into those [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2062.96s)]
*  abortionists or whatever. They don't. Most people, they wake up thinking about their marriage or their [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2066.56s)]
*  kids or the local sports team or whatever. And then they turn on the news and the news is telling [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2072.16s)]
*  that they should, A, that they should be concerned about public affairs, politics, and B, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2078.48s)]
*  people telling them what to think. The polarization that we're talking about is mainly [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2084.64s)]
*  provoked from above, to some extent by media, but mostly by political leaders. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2091.52s)]
*  Okay. So let's say you got to sit with the next president, like you did with former president [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2097.52s)]
*  Clinton and Obama. Yeah. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2103.68s)]
*  What are the top policy solutions you'd recommend to help remedy social isolation? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2106.24s)]
*  I think there are a lot of specific things. For example, about 125 years ago, in other words, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2112.72s)]
*  roughly around 1900 or 1890, what was called the quote boy problem was a big problem. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2118.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know what that is. Well, it was a problem of boys who were [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  getting in trouble and raising trouble for the country as a whole. And to address that problem, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2129.3599999999997s)]
*  a burst of new associations directed at boys were invented. Big Brothers and the organization [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2136.24s)]
*  called Boys Clubs is now called Boys and Girls Club, but it was then called Boys Clubs. It was [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2145.44s)]
*  invented in 1906 and Boy Scouts. Now, what do I infer from that? This goes back to my understanding [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2149.3599999999997s)]
*  of why we would look at that period, the progressive era. Folks in that era were concerned [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2156.32s)]
*  about the same problem we are now. That is, loner males, boys especially, were getting in trouble [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  and causing the country trouble. And nowadays, it's exactly those younger loner males who are [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2171.6000000000004s)]
*  drawn to white nationalism and violence. And so if I were talking to the president and said, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2178.0800000000004s)]
*  how do we solve this problem of white nationalism and violence and terrorism in America? We have to [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2185.28s)]
*  begin early in life. And that means thinking of new ways, not the Boy Scouts or whatever, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2191.28s)]
*  because that's... But what did the Boy Scouts and those other groups do that was so neat? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2197.92s)]
*  They combined something that was fun with moral indoctrination. A scout is trustworthy, helpful, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2202.48s)]
*  friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, I could do this once. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2211.2s)]
*  I love that you still remember most of it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2215.52s)]
*  Oh, I remember it. All the boys in my generation remembered it because it was a pledge. A scout [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2217.68s)]
*  is trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2224.16s)]
*  and reverent. I got it. Now, some of that sounds a little, thrifty sounds a little dated, but [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2228.48s)]
*  trustworthy isn't it? That's not wrong. So we need somebody as bright as the people who invented those [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2234.3999999999996s)]
*  institutions. Now, for the 21st century, the thing about something that's fun that will actually be [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2240.96s)]
*  enjoyable for the kids, but also throw in a dose of character education. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2247.84s)]
*  I want to end by asking you this. You've sounded frustrated with the lack of progress your work has [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2256.16s)]
*  led to. Why do you think it's been so hard to get people from reading your book and understanding [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2262.08s)]
*  your argument to actually doing something about it? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2270.96s)]
*  I wish I knew the answer to that question. Obviously, I wish I knew the answer to that [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2276.08s)]
*  question. First of all, it's a tough problem. I mean, if this were an easy problem, somebody [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2279.44s)]
*  else would have fixed it. And the fact that we're divided as a country, or at least think we're [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2285.92s)]
*  divided, makes it even harder to fix. But for the last 25 years, more than two-thirds of my time [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2291.44s)]
*  has not been spent doing research or writing books. I first of all ran something called the [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2301.44s)]
*  Saguaro seminar, which tried really hard to get smart people, both practitioners and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2306.08s)]
*  intellectuals, together to figure out these problems. And we still couldn't crack the problem. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2311.84s)]
*  But that was my try, and it didn't work. And then the other thing I've spent a ton of time on, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2317.52s)]
*  I've traveled certainly every state and to hundreds of towns, big towns and little towns, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2323.68s)]
*  all across America. Probably over those 25 years, hundreds of thousands of people I've [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2331.68s)]
*  personally spoken to. There are some groups largely around community foundations across America that [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2337.68s)]
*  actually are now, they would tell you, they're following my agenda for trying to fix their [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2342.96s)]
*  communities, who have spent a lot of their time over the last 20 years trying to do what I said [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2347.36s)]
*  they should do. Has that made a difference? I don't know. I may be hard pressed to make the case. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2353.44s)]
*  But that's, you know, believe me, I'm more aware than you are of my failures. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ&t=2359.2s)]
