# 'The Interview': Marlon Wayans Lost Nearly 60 Loved Ones. Comedy Saved Him.
**New York Times - The Interview:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE)
*  Hey, everybody. It's Sabrina. Just popping in here to remind you that every weekend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=0.0s)]
*  on Saturday, we're going to be sending you episodes of a new show our colleagues are [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=6.32s)]
*  making. The show is called The Interview. This weekend, David Marchese talks to comedy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=10.24s)]
*  star Marlon Wayans. A quick warning, there's some swearing and references to sex and sexual [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=17.44s)]
*  assault. Okay, here's the show. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=23.64s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=30.96s)]
*  It's not easy to make what some people might call dumb comedy, because if it were, more [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=36.96s)]
*  people would have a career as successful as Marlon Wayans. Wayans broke out in the early [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=42.24s)]
*  2000s when he co-wrote and co-starred in slapsticky parody comedy movie hits like Scary Movie [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=47.16s)]
*  1 and 2, White Chicks, and my personal favorite, Little Man, which for those of you who don't [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=53.4s)]
*  remember is one in which he plays an adult masquerading as a baby. He spends most of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=58.08s)]
*  the movie in a diaper. Marlon is the youngest of 10 children, and he's a member of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=63.4s)]
*  Wayans family comedy dynasty, which also includes his successful siblings Damon, Sean, Kim, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=68.84s)]
*  and Keenan Ivory Wayans. They all had a hand in the groundbreaking 90s sketch comedy show [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=73.92s)]
*  in Living Color. Marlon went from there to later starring on five seasons of the WB sitcom [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=78.3s)]
*  The Wayans Brothers. He made all those hit movies I mentioned, and then on top of all [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=83.66s)]
*  that, he's also built a nice career for himself as a supporting player in dramatic movies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  But recently, Wayans, who's now 51, has been using his comedy to work through some much [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  heavier topics. His upcoming stand-up special, called Good Grief, is all about the death [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=97.24s)]
*  of his parents, as well as the nearly 60 other loved ones he's lost in just the last few [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=102.74s)]
*  years. When I talked to Marlon, he was in Albuquerque, where he was filming a psychological [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=107.78s)]
*  horror movie with Jordan Peele's production company, and he was getting ready to host [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=112.7s)]
*  a party for the film's cast and crew, where everyone was expected to show up in cowboy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=116.78s)]
*  gear. Here's my conversation with Marlon Wayans. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=121.54s)]
*  Hi Marlon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=129.3s)]
*  What's up David? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=129.8s)]
*  How are you? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=130.8s)]
*  I'm good. Tired. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=131.8s)]
*  Tired from filming? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=132.8s)]
*  Yeah man, this one is a lot on the 50 year old body, 51. But it's great. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=133.82000000000002s)]
*  You said you're tired, but you're having a party tonight? Is that what I just heard? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, when I do movies, I like to form community and family. And so I'm having a party for [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  my cast and my crew at my house that I'm renting. And just kind of gathering, the fights are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=152.62s)]
*  going to be on, and just so people could mingle and roll some cigars and have some tacos. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=158.6s)]
*  Well, you know, since you're having a party tonight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=164.6s)]
*  Shindig. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=167.32s)]
*  A shindig. A knees up. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=168.32s)]
*  You want to pull up? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=169.72s)]
*  It seems like a perfectly natural thing to talk about the subject of your new special, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  which is the death of your parents. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=176.48s)]
*  Gang gang. Isn't that crazy? People are like, what's your next special? I'm like, oh, it's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=178.6s)]
*  a really funny, hilarious journey about the death of my parents. But it wasn't just the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=186.28s)]
*  death of my parents. I lost 57, 58 people that I loved in a matter of three years. And [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=194.84s)]
*  it felt like biblical. You know how you read things in the Bible and you go, man, that's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=204.68s)]
*  some real traumatic stuff that person went through. And then they find this light at [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  the end, we get the lessons. And it's always through like tragedy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=215.44s)]
*  How do you find the funny thing in the sad thing? Or when did you realize that you could [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=220.64s)]
*  make comedy out of these traumatic events? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=225.48s)]
*  It's been a gift since I was a kid. I mean, all of us, Wayans, we're crazy people. Like, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=230.0s)]
*  the worst thing happens and the first thing we think is what's funny about it. There's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=236.56s)]
*  funny absolutely everywhere. I remember my cousin said he died and my auntie buried him [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=240.68s)]
*  on jeans and he had a t-shirt and some Air Force ones and a baseball cap. And me and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  Damon sitting over his casket. And Damon looks at me and goes, you know, if there's a dress [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  code in heaven, I don't think SETI is getting in. And people thought we were crying, but [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  we were crying laughing. We always look for laughs. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=271.64s)]
*  Are there elements of the new special that you can point to and say, you know, this is [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=278.0s)]
*  a kind of joke or the kind of material that I couldn't have done five years ago or 10 [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=284.08s)]
*  years ago? Like, what in it is evidence of your growth as a comedian? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  I think as a comedian, I'm getting to the good stuff. This was the hardest thing for [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=295.76s)]
*  me to do, to work on this material about my mom passing. And I'm still dealing with the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=302.0s)]
*  grief as my dad is on his way to transitioning. I had two shows the night my father passed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=309.26s)]
*  I had two shows. And I pulled up to the comedy club and I get a call and my dad died. I [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=320.08s)]
*  was like, okay. All right. Cried in the car real fast. Boom. I had a show. I didn't cancel [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=327.52s)]
*  the show. I did my show. And then right there in the stage, I told the audience my dad passed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=335.28s)]
*  and I broke down. I cried. And then I got ready for the next show. And I think in order [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  to grow as a comedian, for me, it's like talking about the hard stuff. When you talk about [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=349.24s)]
*  real life pain, like parents passing, something everybody may go through and you can get through [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=357.72s)]
*  that set and you can find these nuances of funny and you can still be irreverent, edgy, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  crazy, silly, thought provoking, and vulnerable all at the same time. I think that's growth. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  And I miss my parents dearly. But I'm a different human with my parents gone than I was when [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  they were here. Because I think now I'm a man. I don't have parents anymore. So I live [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=391.48s)]
*  differently. And I understand the quality of life. I want to vacation more. I don't look at my phone [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=399.0s)]
*  as much. I walk. I never went outside and walked. I was never a walker. I thought people was crazy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=405.72s)]
*  Why are you walking? Like, bro, get on the trip. Every morning I get up and for one half hour, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=411.72s)]
*  I go for a walk. Just to clear my mind, just to think. And it has me thinking in ways that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=418.68s)]
*  I never thought before. I pray more because when I pray, I feel like I'm speaking to my parents [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=425.32s)]
*  and that they're listening. And I let them know what's going on. I report back to them, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=430.68s)]
*  like Mork when he used to talk to Ork into the show. Very 1980s, 70s. But my identity [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=436.84s)]
*  has been concreted in the departure of my legendary parents. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=447.64s)]
*  So the key to self-improvement, it's simple. You just have to have your parents die. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=453.23999999999995s)]
*  That's a way. Sometimes they'll break you though. You know what's crazy? My mother's death broke me. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  It shattered me into a million pieces because that was my girl. I never got married because [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=464.2s)]
*  I never wanted my mother to be jealous of a woman. I never wanted my mother to feel second [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=471.0s)]
*  to any woman. Is that true? You know that's the reason why you never got married? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=474.67999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. One of five reasons. I'll say that was like number two. Number one is I was going to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=477.32s)]
*  fuck that up. It's going to happen. Everybody that knows that I haven't been married, they say [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  all you did was skip two divorces. And my mom was very needy. And I told my mother on her deathbed, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=491.96s)]
*  I said I never got married because I always wanted you to be my number one girl. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=499.32s)]
*  Those were my last words. I said take that to heaven with you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  So I realize as we're talking about this, talking about your parents, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=508.04s)]
*  not really making the case that this is a particularly funny special. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=513.16s)]
*  No, it's hilarious. Let me tell you. It's about an hour and seven minutes. It's hilarious for about [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  an hour and five. And then you have spread throughout the special two to maybe three minutes [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=526.84s)]
*  of heart. I'm proud of this special because I think it's going to make you feel because I'm crazy [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=536.04s)]
*  and I know it and I could be inappropriate and I know it. And I'm always going to be obnoxious [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=542.84s)]
*  in that way. I think in order for me to hit the different levels of comedy, you got to be somewhat [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=547.0s)]
*  offensive. And I'm okay with that. But when you hit the frequency, it speaks to heart. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's so relatable. You don't think that these things that you're going through, you think that [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=560.52s)]
*  it's just happening to you, but you do these sets and you're like, wow, this is happening to a lot [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=565.8s)]
*  of people. You said, you know, to reach certain levels of comedy, you got to be offensive. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=572.04s)]
*  And there is the material in the special. I'm thinking in particular of the, like the Magic [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=577.24s)]
*  Johnson AIDS material. Oh, you saw the special. I saw it. Yeah. Which by the way, he has HIV, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=582.28s)]
*  not AIDS. You should go in and read up that. You know what the other mistake you make is? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=588.84s)]
*  You call Louis Armstrong, sax player, trumpet player. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=592.52s)]
*  But it was still funny, right? Here's the thing. You can't be super like on point with the facts. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=596.92s)]
*  When you're telling jokes, sometimes you just, you tell the jokes, man. And it was crazy. It's like, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=601.88s)]
*  I've had friends and relatives to die from AIDS. And so part of even that joke is finding humor [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=606.92s)]
*  and things that happen. It's a different way to look at something tragic. And I think the world [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=616.5999999999999s)]
*  has forgot how to laugh. And part of it is we're grooming people to be sensitive. But I find when [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=622.12s)]
*  I'm in a comedy club, people like to laugh. They like to laugh at those dark things, the magic [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=628.5999999999999s)]
*  jokes, the people want to laugh again. And I'm trying to deprogram and like get us back to just [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=636.8399999999999s)]
*  laughing. So in the, in the special, you know, there's one magic joke I'm thinking about in [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=644.92s)]
*  particular, where I understand what you're saying that, you know, you sort of have this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  series of jokes where you're framing it like magic's life got better after he got sick, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=655.24s)]
*  you know, that's kind of the hypothesis of the jokes. But then you like throw in a line about [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=660.36s)]
*  there about like sex with monkeys or whatever. And that was the one really where like, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  I cringe. I was like, that's, that's rough. Well, I said, show me the monkey I got next. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=671.0s)]
*  I didn't say he had sex with monkeys. I said, I don't know how he got this good version of this, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=676.76s)]
*  of this disease. But where, however he got that, I want that. I want it that way. To me, that was [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=684.36s)]
*  escapism. Because it's not real. Of course he didn't have sex with a monkey though. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=692.1999999999999s)]
*  If you read into every joke, if you get literal, everybody's going to be offended by it. There's [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=698.9200000000001s)]
*  about 72 things in that special to be offended by. I think great humor is take whoever you send up, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=704.2800000000001s)]
*  those people are laughing the loudest. And I hope that magic laughs the loudest at that joke, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=715.48s)]
*  which he will. Magic has a great sense of humor. I hope Shaq laughs at his joke. I hope all them [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=722.44s)]
*  laugh at- Do your Shaq impression right now. Do your Shaq impression. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=727.88s)]
*  Kobe. You know, these are friends of mine, right? When Kevin Hart does a LeBron hairline joke, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=735.0s)]
*  I don't think LeBron gets mad. I think, you know, part of it is it's all out there, right? I'm not [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=742.36s)]
*  telling no secrets. This is all out there. I'm just going, here's a different way to look at it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=748.28s)]
*  I rescued myself from depression by learning to laugh in my worst circumstances. Losing my parents [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=754.9200000000001s)]
*  broke me. And I'm telling the audience, here's how you can survive this. Find humor in everything. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=765.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, the idea of the culture getting too sensitive or overly sensitive, it's something [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=775.96s)]
*  that people have been talking about and have identified for a while now. And I'm just interested [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=782.2s)]
*  in digging into that a little bit more, because on one hand, what we might say is too sensitive [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=787.72s)]
*  could also be understood as, you know, the culture being made safe for people who didn't feel safe [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=795.88s)]
*  in the culture before. Like the example that comes to mind for me is it's one that has to do [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=802.76s)]
*  with your life. You have a trans son, right? And so the sensitivity around how people talk about [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=807.8s)]
*  transgender people and, you know, what they say and how we think about transgender people, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=817.64s)]
*  that is directly related to a change in the culture that allows your son to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=822.04s)]
*  live the life that he wants to live. These things are connected. So how do you see that connection? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  Like on the one hand, what you're calling the sensitivity, on the other hand, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=834.68s)]
*  how a culture actually changes. I'm working on a beautiful hour [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=838.76s)]
*  about that, about the transition. And as a parent that went through it, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=843.72s)]
*  I think I have something to say that forwards the agenda of that kind of unconditional love [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=851.96s)]
*  and acceptance for your child and for others, I went through it. And the transition wasn't about [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=859.0s)]
*  their transition. It was my transition, going from like, opposing what they wanted to do [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=867.08s)]
*  to complete acceptance. And it was the five stages of grief. I felt like I was losing my daughter. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=876.36s)]
*  My daughter was dying in my eyes. And so I speak about this from a true perspective. And I take you [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=883.24s)]
*  through the five stages of grief. And midway through the act, after denial, after anger, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=890.52s)]
*  and when I get to bargaining, that's when the whole set flips. Because the people that are angry and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  denial, you know, they're all on my side as the parent at first. And I'm talking in complete [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=911.08s)]
*  ignorance, because that's what a lot of people are. And then the whole set takes a complete 180. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=918.2800000000001s)]
*  Because it's about me getting to acceptance. And I become a cautionary tale [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=927.72s)]
*  for the people that may be going through this of how you can get through this. Try to get to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=934.6s)]
*  acceptance as quickly as possible. It took me all of a week. That's all. It sounds like a busy week. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=940.5200000000001s)]
*  It was. It was. Well, I was like, no, you can't do this. You can't do that. I'm not supporting it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=947.1600000000001s)]
*  I was that guy. I was that guy. And I'm ashamed to say it, because in my eyes, I was protecting my [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=953.96s)]
*  child. Now understanding that all I was doing was creating distance, and that's not fair [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=961.48s)]
*  to them. Who the f am I to stand in this person's way and tell them what's right for their life? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=967.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm a parent. And the only thing I can do as a parent is be an example to love my child and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=974.36s)]
*  hope that other parents do the same. So did your experience with your son and understanding what [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=982.76s)]
*  your thought process was, the five stages, and how you reacted to, what pronouns does your son use? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=992.28s)]
*  He and they. Right. So reacting to what they were going through. Did that change or affect your [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=999.72s)]
*  thinking at all about comedy and who gets made fun of when and how and when to push buttons? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1006.2s)]
*  Yes and no. I think a comedian has the right to have their point of view, just as people [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1013.08s)]
*  have their right to have their point of view. I don't get offended by anybody's humor. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1025.4s)]
*  I think, look, Don Rickles did a lot of racist jokes, but man, he was really funny. He was a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1032.76s)]
*  really funny racist. I'm part comedian, right? So before I'm even like black or a man, I'm a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1038.36s)]
*  comedian. I'm all for comedians developing their point of view, no matter how ignorant, small, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1044.76s)]
*  inconsiderate, dark. They have to do this because if nobody tries to find the funny, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1056.36s)]
*  then society's missing out on humor. There are certain comedians, I'm thinking of [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1064.12s)]
*  Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, where it seems like to them, material about transgender people, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1071.6399999999999s)]
*  it's the taboo that they need to keep pushing at to show that they're willing to push at a taboo. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1079.0s)]
*  I don't think it's the taboo that they're pushing at. They just want to say what the hell they want [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1085.0s)]
*  to say. They want you to tell me what I can say and not say. Dave is a friend of mine. I have a [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1089.72s)]
*  trans child. I'm not going to not be Dave's friend because of his point of view. I went to see his [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1095.88s)]
*  shows. We've had several conversations about things. He knows I have a trans son, but that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1101.56s)]
*  doesn't change the fact that, hey, you got to outwarn this that he wants to do from his point of [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1107.64s)]
*  view and he has every right to do it. Me and my child had this conversation and they understood. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1113.4s)]
*  They may feel that way, but I said as a comedian, he has every right to say what he wants to say [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1119.16s)]
*  and try to find the humor in what he's saying. I don't think his intention is to make you feel bad. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  I think he's just trying to protect his right to say what he feels. We don't have to think alike. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1135.72s)]
*  You're still my friend. I learned from you. There's things I learned from you. Hopefully, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1143.56s)]
*  through conversations, we could come to the fence and disagree on some things, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1148.76s)]
*  but we affect change in each other. That's life. I think we have to learn to laugh again. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1154.12s)]
*  We're heading to a very sad place when we can't laugh anymore. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1164.36s)]
*  But I really think the idea that we don't laugh anymore is just fundamentally wrong. If you take [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1169.48s)]
*  social media as an example, social media is just joke after joke after joke, funny meme after funny [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1176.12s)]
*  meme. To me, the question is really what are those jokes saying? Who's telling the joke? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1181.96s)]
*  Who's telling the joke and what are they trying to convey with the joke? I think that feels to me [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1188.2s)]
*  like the more germane question. People don't tell the same jokes they used to at work. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1193.4s)]
*  There's no water cooler talk anymore. When's the last time you were at a water cooler? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1200.04s)]
*  When you got on a water cooler. I got one in my house. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1205.48s)]
*  Was your assistant laughing at your jokes? Oh, good for you. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1208.6s)]
*  No, but I think even now when you walk on sets, it's like everybody's tight. Nobody wants to offend. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1212.04s)]
*  Nobody wants to say anything. We're a bunch of robots just walking around. There's no joy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1218.44s)]
*  That's why I love performing on a stage because it's a reminder to me that people still want to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1225.4s)]
*  laugh. There's nothing like that elation that you get. It's a high that you get when you don't know [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1230.1200000000001s)]
*  if this joke that I'm about to say is going to offend everybody or they're going to walk out [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1236.3600000000001s)]
*  or they're going to boo me or they're going to hate this. And then you tell it and everybody [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1240.92s)]
*  cracks up and you're like, it's just when you get into the corporate setting or you go sometimes [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1245.4s)]
*  when you go home, it's safety again. But now even then, you can't say that. You got your kids [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1252.2s)]
*  telling you, dad, that's inappropriate. That's inappropriate to you, you little fucker. To me, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1260.44s)]
*  it's perfect. I pay the rent here. I'm going to say what I want. It's okay for me to be [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1264.92s)]
*  inappropriate. My inappropriateness has paid for your college. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1269.88s)]
*  You talked earlier about changes in what's considered funny or what we expect of comedians. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1278.68s)]
*  I was thinking about that in the context of your hit movies, which come out of the tradition of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1285.5600000000002s)]
*  Mel Brooks films or Zuckerman, Abram Zuckerman films. Those were hits. Those were moneymakers. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1292.8400000000001s)]
*  You made them cheap and you made a lot of money on them. But those kinds of films are also really [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1298.84s)]
*  not in vogue anymore. And it seems to be like both in standup and in film comedy, generally, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1302.84s)]
*  there's always the idea that the comedy has to be about something in addition to being funny. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1310.52s)]
*  It can't just be a funny movie. It also has to be about a larger theme. And I'm curious to know [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  like why you think the kind of comedies that you made your name with fell out of vogue. What's [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1323.16s)]
*  changed? Well, if you look at Hollywood for the past 10 years, there hasn't been a lot of comedies, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1333.48s)]
*  period. Because Hollywood, everything is cyclical. They were chasing the superhero. They were chasing [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1340.3600000000001s)]
*  the blockbuster. And I'm very patient because they're going to make comedies again. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1347.72s)]
*  But I think the people that's going to make the comedies are the people that know how to make the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1354.3600000000001s)]
*  comedies. They keep trying to make like scary movie. The audience is like, that don't taste [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1360.6000000000001s)]
*  like the Wayans. I'm not going. Because they know we know how to tell these jokes. There's a family [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1372.04s)]
*  recipe that we've had. You can't replicate what we do. It's just we know you can have all the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1379.48s)]
*  seasonings. You don't know how much to put on it. Wait, are you, is the new scary movie that they [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1386.2s)]
*  just announced that irritating to you? No, I mean, you know, it's not the first time we've [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1392.92s)]
*  we've heard it. You know, so if they want to waste $50 million, go for it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1401.3200000000002s)]
*  Do you get a check from that? No, that's a whole nother conversation. I like to say that, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1411.24s)]
*  you know, those Weinsteins, they [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1418.04s)]
*  they, they, they, they raped everybody. Not the same business wise, not the same business wise, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1420.36s)]
*  literally and business wise. They, they, we, we all got a little bit of a little taste. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1437.4799999999998s)]
*  They, there was some terrible, terrible people. Good example of an offensive joke. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1442.52s)]
*  Depends on the audience. Damn, Dave, you sensitive. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1449.24s)]
*  I'm gonna take you to a Ricky Gervais show and a Dave Chappelle show. And I'm gonna sit next to you [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1454.9199999999998s)]
*  and watch as you go, Oh God. Wait, do me being sensitive in a white guy voice. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1460.6s)]
*  Oh God, you can't say that. Christ. Jesus. Hey, Christ. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1467.3999999999999s)]
*  That's inappropriate. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1476.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's crazy. Well, it's crazy, Marlon. Like, no, I think like even when you go on stage, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1481.72s)]
*  right. And you say a certain topic. Immediately. Sometimes you feel audience tighten up. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1487.16s)]
*  Yeah. And then your job as a comedian is [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1497.72s)]
*  to basically beat them into submission until they either lighten up or they tighten up so much [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  that you lead they tight ass was right there and you say good night. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1510.76s)]
*  Just before we go, you know, I know you got to get ready for a party. Can you tell me a [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1516.28s)]
*  funny party story from your life? A funny party story? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1522.52s)]
*  A funny party story? Yeah, party story. I feel like you've been to a few parties. I've been to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1526.92s)]
*  too many parties. Oh, man. Oh, I saw Tupac 20 minutes before he got shot. And ironically, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1532.68s)]
*  I saw Biggie 20 minutes before he got shot. I mean, it's not funny, but what a coincidence. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1541.56s)]
*  Wait, is that true? In both instances? Yeah. Holy moly. That's not funny. 20 minutes from now, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1546.12s)]
*  you make his shot. Here's the thing. And then you laugh. He's a sick man. David. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1552.92s)]
*  Wait, can I try an offensive joke on you? Go for it. So you had 58. I just thought of this one. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1559.24s)]
*  Go for it. You had 58 loved ones. Yes. Tyrese. You ever think the problem is you? Are you contagious? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1565.4s)]
*  They want to get the hell away from me. 58 people? Or wait, I can keep going. 60 if you include [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1575.4s)]
*  Tupac and Biggie. There you go. Are you counting anyone that you just admire as a loved one? Like [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1581.48s)]
*  you see Tina Turner died. She's just number 55. No, she wasn't one of the people. Some of those [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1586.84s)]
*  people were. Chadwick was a friend. That was the hard one. I swear, it's crazy when you think about [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1594.52s)]
*  how many people have passed. And that's what made me do the special because I feel like we need to [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1604.92s)]
*  laugh about it. I needed therapy. It was therapy for me. I still hurt. But man, the last time I [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1610.12s)]
*  cried about my mom and my dad was only on set recently. And that's because my director, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1618.28s)]
*  he's a sick man and he wanted to incite some feelings. And he said, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1627.8s)]
*  just think about how proud your mom and dad are of you right now. And I thought about [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1634.12s)]
*  how I showed up in their absence from our family. And how I was able to help bury them, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1645.96s)]
*  help my older siblings get through, help my nephews and my nieces just show up for everybody. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1655.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that's what they raise me to be. And that's what they'd be proud of. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1662.04s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you showing that emotion now. I can see [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1669.8799999999999s)]
*  tears in your eyes. And you know, I'm sorry that you're going through that, but it's really good [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1673.96s)]
*  for me for this podcast if you cry maybe a little bit more audibly. I'd really appreciate that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1679.8s)]
*  I like you. You're going to be my friend, Dave. You're going to be my friend. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1686.2s)]
*  But you know, thank you for that openness. I appreciate it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1694.04s)]
*  You just want to leave on a high note. But that was a joyful cry. I do miss them, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1698.1200000000001s)]
*  but I know they would be proud. But Marlon, I'll talk to you later this week. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1703.56s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1708.52s)]
*  After the break, I call Marlon back to revisit that Weinstein joke [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1709.0s)]
*  and talk a little bit more about parenthood. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1718.04s)]
*  I can't say what I am as a father. They can say what I am as a father. And when I'm gone, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1720.52s)]
*  I hope I left them with a whole lot of love and a whole lot of memories. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1726.92s)]
*  What if flaws, whatever, I wasn't able to show up? I hope they forget that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1730.36s)]
*  Hi, Marlon. How are you? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1739.0s)]
*  I'm good, man. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1754.12s)]
*  So, you know, I was thinking about a very specific moment from our conversation where [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1757.48s)]
*  I asked you about no longer being involved with the scary movie franchise and you mentioned [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1764.9199999999998s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein, who, you know, I guess you believe kind of strong armed you out of the series. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1770.52s)]
*  Actually, it was Bob and Harvey. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1777.32s)]
*  But it was clear you were loading up a joke. And you had this pause where I think you were [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1780.12s)]
*  thinking about then whether to say the joke. And I want to know if you can tell me like in your head [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1786.36s)]
*  in that moment when you have the like the potentially offensive joke lined up, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1792.84s)]
*  what is actually going through your head in that pause? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1799.72s)]
*  Who's my audience? And I heard you cringe on the other thing, the monkey joke. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1803.3999999999999s)]
*  But I was going to say, you know, he didn't just, you know, he does this with women. He [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1811.56s)]
*  raves too. Trust me. We did business with him. Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1818.28s)]
*  You see your response? You see? Did you see your response? I call that we call that and [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1823.32s)]
*  me and my brother, we'd be in a writer's room. Oh, we'd be in network notes. And, you know, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1829.0s)]
*  we've always been edgy with our humor. Always. That's just how we do it. Right. And so when [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1833.6399999999999s)]
*  people have that reaction, like, Oh, God, you know, little thing you do. We call that we used to call [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1840.28s)]
*  that getting on a whitey bike. It was like brothers would crack up at that. But why do you like, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1846.92s)]
*  I don't know about that. And they start peddling backwards. You know, it's funny, though, I'm not, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1852.92s)]
*  I don't know if the whitey bike is actually the bike I ride on because [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1858.2s)]
*  it's the bike that you said it made me laugh. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1864.68s)]
*  I'm not offended, you know, but there is the thing where it's like, when somebody says the taboo thing, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1868.68s)]
*  where you go like, I don't know, are you allowed to say that? But that's different than taking a [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1874.12s)]
*  fence. You know what I mean? But what is taboo? When you've been in a situation for me, right? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1877.72s)]
*  Once again, I can talk about things from a different perspective. And when I talk about [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1882.44s)]
*  Bob and Harvey, and I say that it's because there's damage there. I can go into a whole [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1887.0s)]
*  another article about the scary movie franchise. And you guys are like, Oh, I see why he said what [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1894.28s)]
*  he said. Because we have been victims in that way, but in business, not physically, but in [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1900.2s)]
*  business. And you know, I think a monster is a monster. And those monsters showed up in business [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1907.56s)]
*  as well. Yeah. You know, in the Good Grief special, you talked about how you learned to be a man from [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1913.72s)]
*  your dad. But I'm curious about what you learned about manhood and masculinity from your son. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1921.32s)]
*  That sometimes you have to work your femininity. It's okay to be in touch with your feminine. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1929.72s)]
*  It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to express yourself. It's okay to unstrap from your masculinity [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1937.3200000000002s)]
*  and your ego. And sometimes that takes you not to, you know, to have a different approach. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1943.72s)]
*  And sometimes it's not about trying to teach them, maybe God's trying to teach you something. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1950.1200000000001s)]
*  And so it taught me to be a lot more accepting and unconditional and even forgiving of myself. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1954.92s)]
*  It's okay to have stupid thoughts. It's okay to forgive yourself for having a point of view [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1964.28s)]
*  that's not completely popular or evolved. It's okay to have those small feelings, those insecure [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1970.52s)]
*  things, those egotistical thoughts. That's like, nah, I think I can control everything. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1978.1200000000001s)]
*  And then God breaks you down and life breaks you down. And when you realize that you are crumbled [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1984.12s)]
*  and you're on your knees, that's when God can just whisper to you. And you're like, oh, that's what [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1990.6799999999998s)]
*  you're trying to teach me. And I'm very grateful to my child. I love that baby, because that's my [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=1995.32s)]
*  firstborn. And I can't say what I am as a father. They can say what I am as a father. And when I'm [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2001.6399999999999s)]
*  gone, I hope I left them with a whole lot of love and a whole lot of memories. Whatever flaws, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2009.72s)]
*  I wasn't able to show up. I hope they forgive that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2016.3600000000001s)]
*  You've referred a couple of times to hearing God or God talking to you. And [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2021.32s)]
*  do you remember the last thing God said to you or the last thing that you remember [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2026.44s)]
*  feeling like it was coming from God? For me, my God speaks to me every day. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2030.6000000000001s)]
*  He's in everything I do, even in my jokes, even in my experience, even in the darkness. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2036.12s)]
*  God gave me a gift, which is to stay joyful through dark things. He gave me a gift. And I'm [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2041.1599999999999s)]
*  going to give that gift as much as I can, as long as I can. And that will be my life identity, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2048.04s)]
*  is that in the worst moments, I was able to try and find a smile and hold my hand up through the [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2054.2799999999997s)]
*  rubble and go, Hey guys, take this one with you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2059.4s)]

*  you're a heck of a guy. Geez, Louise is my favorite. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2073.0s)]
*  I'm gonna keep you on number bro. I need the white guy voice. It's been a darn pleasure talking to [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE&t=2078.76s)]
