# Yair Lapid Says the World Misunderstands Israel
**New York Times - The Interview:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw)
*  This is The Interview, a new show from The New York Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=7.0s)]
*  I first arrived in the Middle East in 2002 during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=10.24s)]
*  Uprising. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=15.64s)]
*  I lived in Jerusalem and reported on Israelis and Palestinians off and on for the following [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=16.64s)]
*  decade. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=22.3s)]
*  There were stretches of horrific violence while I was there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=23.3s)]
*  Even during the darkest moments, I saw that many people on both sides of the conflict [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=27.8s)]
*  believed that peace could be achieved. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=33.6s)]
*  That no longer feels true. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=36.64s)]
*  Since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, killing over a thousand Israelis and capturing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  hostages, Israel's response has been swift and brutal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=44.08s)]
*  More than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, the majority of them civilians, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=48.32s)]
*  according to the local authorities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=53.28s)]
*  Most of Gaza's infrastructure has been destroyed, and international pressure is mounting on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=55.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war and to avoid a new one with Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  In this moment, I wanted to talk to one of Netanyahu's most vocal critics inside Israel, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=67.88s)]
*  Yair Lapid. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=73.08s)]
*  Lapid is the official leader of the Israeli opposition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=74.8s)]
*  He's a former journalist, TV host, and actor who entered Israeli politics over a decade [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=78.8s)]
*  founding a centrist party called Yesh Atid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=84.84s)]
*  He briefly became prime minister of Israel in 2022, and he remains a member of the Knesset [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  or Israeli parliament. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=92.44s)]
*  After October 7th, he refused to join Netanyahu's war cabinet. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=94.48s)]
*  He's called for new elections to replace the current government, and he's publicly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=98.64s)]
*  endorsed a two-state solution, something Netanyahu has actively worked against. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=102.64s)]
*  For my first episode of this new show, I spoke to Lapid about the war and what comes next. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=109.2s)]
*  We talked twice, and like all conversations about the Middle East, these were complicated [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=115.8s)]
*  and emotional. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=122.92s)]
*  Here's my interview with Yair Lapid. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=124.96s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, before we dig in on specifics, can you just tell me, as an Israeli leader, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=130.88s)]
*  as an Israeli citizen, how you're feeling about this moment in Israeli history? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we've seen just a slew of unprecedented things happen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=142.28s)]
*  This is so true. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=147.28s)]
*  How do I feel about this? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=149.24s)]
*  I feel, I guess, separate about this as a political leader and as an Israeli. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=150.96s)]
*  As an Israeli, I'm as worried as I've ever been. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=158.94s)]
*  I feel the fragility of our society. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  I feel the pain. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  I meet with the hostage family and discuss with them the endless pain and fear and agony [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=165.88000000000002s)]
*  they have. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=172.96s)]
*  And, of course, there's no way for me not to imagine me being in their place if my children [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=173.96s)]
*  were there or my mother was there, held by a terror organization. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm haunted by memories of October 7th, by the implications on our security. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=188.84s)]
*  As a political leader, I'm worried, but a different kind of worried because I don't [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  think we have the right leadership to handle the moment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=201.44s)]
*  And I feel a little uncomfortable discussing this in English with the New York Times because, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=205.92s)]
*  you know, traditionally we used to say, no, no, we're not going to get into Israeli politics [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=211.76s)]
*  while dealing with the international media. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  This is so extreme and so painful. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=218.2s)]
*  So what we need is a restart as a nation, as people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=221.84s)]
*  And on top of this, I feel misunderstood. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  You personally or the country? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Both, but mostly the country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=235.0s)]
*  I feel that we are fighting an existential war. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=237.64s)]
*  I don't think people understand the level of fear and angst. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=242.56s)]
*  I don't think people, I mean, the international community, the international media, sometimes [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=248.96s)]
*  it is horrifying to me to see this footage of young people marching in American campuses, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=256.08s)]
*  shouting from the river to the sea. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  And then you ask them, do you know what river it is or what sea it is? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  And they have no clue. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  So they're putting us on the side of the bad guys, resulting in knowing what happened, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=269.16s)]
*  what have we been going through. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=275.04s)]
*  So if you feel that there's a mixture of feelings that I'm describing you right, it is a mixture, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  but none of it is really great. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=285.24s)]
*  You came to the US earlier this month to meet with US political leaders, including Secretary [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=289.88s)]
*  of State Tony Blinken, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=297.48s)]
*  I do want to ask you how you think Mr. Netanyahu has handled relations with the current US [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  administration. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it could be argued that the prime minister's government has at certain moments [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  almost tried to embarrass the Biden administration. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=312.24s)]
*  I'm thinking of when Secretary of State Blinken went to Tel Aviv and on the same day a new [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=314.44s)]
*  settlement expansion in the West Bank was announced. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=318.76s)]
*  Biden has been a real friend to Bibi, but is Bibi a friend to Biden? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=322.04s)]
*  No. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=328.0s)]
*  And it is heartwarming the way the president has handled this because he was able to maintain [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  the idea that supporting Israel is his historic role as an American president. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=341.56s)]
*  And he's done so in an election year, which is even more impressive to me because right [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  now part of what is so dangerous in the current phase of the relations is that, I'll put it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=354.6s)]
*  this way, I don't think Israel is going to be the reason for anyone to win or lose an [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=360.16s)]
*  American election. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=367.04s)]
*  But if President Biden will lose the election, there's going to be a lot of people in the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=369.52s)]
*  Democratic Party who's going to say it's because of Israel, or at least this is going to be [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=373.04s)]
*  one of the claims. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=377.08s)]
*  And then Israel, instead of being an electoral currency or value or an advantage, has become [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=379.4s)]
*  a liability, which is horrible. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  You blame that on Prime Minister Netanyahu or you blame that on the war itself? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=391.84s)]
*  Because we've seen an impassioned pro-Palestinian movement here in the U.S. that fundamentally [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=398.2s)]
*  seems to have shifted the way the public views Israel. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=405.8s)]
*  Well blame is complicated, first and foremost. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=413.68s)]
*  I blame it on a cynical, this is not even pro-Palestinian, pro-Islamic, pro-fundamentalism, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=418.56s)]
*  radical Islamic movement that is using the lack of knowledge mostly from American youngsters [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=426.44s)]
*  who know nothing about and they're buying this as part of the ongoing struggle between [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=434.32s)]
*  the oppressors and those who are oppressed or between white privileged people and people [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=440.48s)]
*  who are not. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=446.44s)]
*  And, you know, they keep telling them, you know, Anna Frank was not a white privileged [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=447.44s)]
*  kid. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=452.56s)]
*  And the story is not what you are told and how come you're marching in favor of people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=454.0s)]
*  who want to kill Jews because they're Jews, because this is the way Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=460.44s)]
*  and the Islamic Jihad are. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=466.24s)]
*  And they're supporting them against a democratic country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  This is, to me, unbelievable in so many ways. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  But I also blame an Israeli government who doesn't understand or doesn't seem to care [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=476.32s)]
*  about its primary duty to make this easier for those who support us in the United States [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=484.0s)]
*  to be supportive, while not, for example, making sure settler's violence is restrained, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=492.8s)]
*  while not making sure we're doing what needs to be done in terms of explaining what is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=500.48s)]
*  really happening in the war in Gaza. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  Not doing the simple things, like saying, yes, our heart is broken when children are [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  dying in Gaza because children are not supposed to die in grown-ups' wars and because we [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=515.56s)]
*  have no war with children and we try to do our utmost to avoid from hurting the innocent. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  And this is a very dense populated area. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=530.04s)]
*  This is a very cruel war against an enemy that uses his own people, his own children, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  as human shields, and casualties are sometimes inevitable. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=538.32s)]
*  But we are sorry. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=542.72s)]
*  And we are, you know what? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  The ridiculous thing is we are doing our best. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=545.7600000000001s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Army is doing its best to avoid this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=548.32s)]
*  And yet the government is not saying so out loud because they're afraid of some ignorant, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=552.0s)]
*  I don't know, populist voices that might say they are soft on handling the war. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  This is just outrageous to me. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=567.48s)]
*  I mean, you say that Israel is sorry for the great loss of Palestinian life. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=570.12s)]
*  But one of the big points of contention, not only here in the United States, but globally, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=577.08s)]
*  is that very fact that there has been a restriction of aid, that Israel has been using massive [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  bombs in the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=590.32s)]
*  And as you note, it is densely populated, that it has been flattened. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=592.36s)]
*  Do you agree with the measures taken so far and the conduct of the war? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=598.08s)]
*  Well, there's no simple answer. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=604.88s)]
*  Basically we should have pushed inside Gaza more aid, and we are doing so now after way [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=607.72s)]
*  too long. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=613.52s)]
*  But there's something to be said before that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=615.52s)]
*  What is the alternative? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=619.48s)]
*  Because right now to engage in this war has only one alternative, and this is being murdered. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=621.36s)]
*  I mean, we never asked for this war. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=630.12s)]
*  We never wanted this war, and we only went out for this war because our children were [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=633.36s)]
*  burned alive, because our elderly were killed because we have hostages in the terror tunnels, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=639.76s)]
*  and they raped women, and they conquered villages. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=648.8399999999999s)]
*  And more than that, they have openly said, they mean Hamas, that if they have a chance, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=653.4799999999999s)]
*  they'll do it again. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=659.8399999999999s)]
*  And therefore, we are in Gaza to make sure it will never happen again. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  October 7th was the worst day in the history of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=666.7199999999999s)]
*  So it is our duty to make sure it will never happen again. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  And therefore, we were forced, and I want to emphasize this, forced into Gaza and into [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=676.04s)]
*  this war. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  The way that this war has been conducted, the fact that Gaza is going to be left in [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  tatters, there's been an enormous loss of life. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=690.68s)]
*  We've seen this in other parts of the world in which the next generation, what they learn [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=693.76s)]
*  from that is that a group like Hamas actually is their representative. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=698.76s)]
*  At least they defend them. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=706.08s)]
*  I guess how in the conduct of this war is this actually going to increase Israel's security? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=708.16s)]
*  You know, I think it was on October 11th, four days after the massacre, President Biden [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=718.92s)]
*  gave the first speech about what happened. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=726.48s)]
*  And he said there, there is such a thing in life as pure evil. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=728.92s)]
*  And I think he was signaling to those of us who are saying, you know, you know, everything [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=734.02s)]
*  is relative, everybody has their own narrative, every story has two sides to it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=738.24s)]
*  No, sometimes there is right and wrong in this world. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=744.4399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes there is justice and injustice. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=747.8s)]
*  Hamas is a murderous bunch of people who they want to kill us because who we are, not because [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  something we did. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=758.32s)]
*  And because they are religious fanatics, the only way to handle them is to fight them. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=760.2800000000001s)]
*  And you know what, I give more credit to the Palestinians. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=766.44s)]
*  And I said, maybe not in this generation, but maybe the next generation, they will choose [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=770.48s)]
*  good over evil. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=775.22s)]
*  They will choose an advanced society over a society that is dedicating itself to death [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=776.52s)]
*  and destruction. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=782.24s)]
*  They will, I mean, what you are saying is, and of course, I'm not holding this against [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=783.72s)]
*  you because I know you're just asking the question, but basically what the implication [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=789.0s)]
*  of what you're saying is that the Palestinians are not capable of making right choices. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think they might be capable of making right choices. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=798.56s)]
*  I have maybe more trust in them than you are. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=802.4s)]
*  And I think they can choose life over death and building over destruction. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=804.84s)]
*  It is possible. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=810.88s)]
*  And the problem is we don't find enough Palestinians right now who are willing to make this choice. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=812.4s)]
*  Mr. Lepid, as I hear you speaking, I hear things that remind me of certain comments [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=817.24s)]
*  that I've heard Mr. Netanyahu make. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=824.16s)]
*  And so- [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=827.72s)]
*  Oh, now we're going into insults. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=828.72s)]
*  No, I think- [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=829.72s)]
*  No, no, I'm kidding. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not insults. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  I am wondering, you very deliberately did not join the war cabinet. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  Can you tell me why you didn't? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=839.52s)]
*  You lead the opposition and just hearing you speak about your defense of the conduct of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=842.52s)]
*  the war, I'm wondering what you are in opposition to. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=847.48s)]
*  Part of it is because somebody has to say out loud, we have to maintain our democratic [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=851.36s)]
*  spine. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  We have to make sure we are handling this at least the best that we can. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=860.8399999999999s)]
*  And we have to understand that the future lies also with discussing this with other [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=867.64s)]
*  Palestinians like the Palestinian Authority. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=874.12s)]
*  And also, I think having an opposition during wartime is even more important than it is [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=877.52s)]
*  during peacetime in a democracy. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=887.12s)]
*  This country needs someone who will speak about the future in different terms. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=889.64s)]
*  We need in this country somebody who will be able to talk to the American administration [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=893.24s)]
*  or to the American political realm in a different language. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=896.88s)]
*  And we need people who will say, let us remember that we don't want to be like them. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=900.72s)]
*  We want to be different. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=906.84s)]
*  This is what makes us strong. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=908.08s)]
*  And besides, I feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu is part of what led us to, as a huge responsibility [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=910.76s)]
*  to what led us to the current situation. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=920.88s)]
*  And sitting behind him and becoming a front or legitimizing his premiership doesn't seem [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=924.12s)]
*  to be a good idea. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=932.68s)]
*  The people of Israel need to know there is a possibility for a different future for them. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=934.12s)]
*  But yes, there are views in which I'm an Israeli patriot. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=939.4s)]
*  I think the Israeli army is conducting itself in terrible, sometimes impossible circumstances [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=943.76s)]
*  in an honorable way and doing its best to avoid hurting the innocent. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=952.24s)]
*  And therefore, I feel obligated to defend the way the Israeli defense forces are dealing [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=956.76s)]
*  with themselves. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=963.32s)]
*  On the other hand, when something terrible like when Israel accidentally killed the employees [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  of the World Kitchen Organization, I would be the first one to say, listen, we are sorry, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=974.5200000000001s)]
*  this shouldn't have happened. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=979.6400000000001s)]
*  And to demand there will be an investigation, to demand that there will be results to these [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  investigations. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  So I think this voice is necessary. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=987.44s)]
*  So I think I did the right thing staying out of government. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=990.84s)]
*  This brings us to this moment in Israel. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  You have called for new elections. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=997.96s)]
*  But meanwhile, the situation with Iran has also escalated. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  It's no longer a shadow war where the two parties avoid direct conflict. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1004.72s)]
*  What do you think needs to happen? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you still think there needs to be new elections? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1012.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1015.36s)]
*  This is not ideal, of course, to have an election when the fighting is still going on and we [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1016.84s)]
*  don't know where it's going. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1023.88s)]
*  But we're only dealing now and we have dealt with, since October 7th, bad options. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1025.72s)]
*  We just have bad options. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1031.52s)]
*  And between the bad options, an election, a quick election, we can have it in 60 days [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1032.76s)]
*  and an election day is just a day. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1038.76s)]
*  But basically, we don't have the right government for the challenges we have. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1041.32s)]
*  So we have to make the effort and replace this government with a government that can [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1045.98s)]
*  deal with the war, with the Iranians, with the relations with the American administration, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1050.74s)]
*  create an alliance with the Saudis, with the Emirates, with others in order to change the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  course not only of Israel but also the entire Middle East and make this into an anti-Iranian [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1064.98s)]
*  alliance. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1072.42s)]
*  So what we need to do is to recreate and rejuvenate the alliance we have with the moderate [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1074.38s)]
*  Sunni states. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1081.4s)]
*  For this to happen, we need to have with them a discussion that talks both about the Iranians [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1082.7600000000002s)]
*  and the Palestinians because this is their demand and this is also for our own good. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1089.5200000000002s)]
*  And therefore, we need to be able to tell them, yes, we are going to work with the Palestinian [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1095.3000000000002s)]
*  Authority and we're going to start in Gaza because we have to rebuild and reconstruct [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1100.74s)]
*  Gaza and rehabilitate Gaza. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1105.6200000000001s)]
*  And we have to do this with the Saudis, with the Emirates and with the Palestinian Authority. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1108.26s)]
*  And so what should happen to Gaza and the Palestinians after the war? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1113.24s)]
*  Who should pay for the rebuilding? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1118.3000000000002s)]
*  Who should govern it? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1119.8000000000002s)]
*  Where should the displaced people go? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1121.16s)]
*  I mean, specifically, I'm just wondering what your particular vision is. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1122.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, we should build an alliance of, as I said, the moderate Sunni states, the Palestinian [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1128.34s)]
*  Authority, the international community, United States, the European Union, whoever is these [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1135.6999999999998s)]
*  days showing so much concern, and Israel, in order to start rebuilding and replacing [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1142.54s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1150.82s)]
*  Because as long as Hamas is there and Hamas is active and Hamas has control over the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1152.3s)]
*  territory, there will be no future for the people of Gaza. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1157.8999999999999s)]
*  They have to understand this. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1161.1399999999999s)]
*  But basically, if you ask me, in 2021, I presented a plan that was named Economy for Security. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1163.02s)]
*  I'm free translating this from Hebrew now, which meant let's give the people of Gaza [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1173.3s)]
*  an economic future in return of displacing Hamas with something more positive. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1178.7s)]
*  So what do we know about these people? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1186.92s)]
*  We know that they are not Hamas. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1189.0s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, I just want to jump in here. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1191.92s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1194.6000000000001s)]
*  You're talking about actually what has been a very old idea. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1195.92s)]
*  I mean, as you know, I covered Israel and the Palestinian territories for many years. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1199.24s)]
*  And the idea of giving economic prosperity to the Palestinians has been bandied about [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1205.24s)]
*  for decades. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1209.88s)]
*  But very little of this debate has been about the occupation. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1212.54s)]
*  For many years, including when you were prime minister, there was a sense that when it came [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1219.02s)]
*  to the Palestinians, the status quo could simply be accepted and ignored. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1223.94s)]
*  The idea that Palestinians would want their own self-determination, their own state, could [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1229.7s)]
*  be put aside and that somehow economic prosperity could be a substitution. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1236.74s)]
*  Do you think that idea was wrong? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1244.3s)]
*  Were you wrong? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1248.82s)]
*  Well, I never said this, but so I wasn't wrong. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1249.82s)]
*  I always said the difference between the Israelis and the Palestinians is that people tend not [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  to understand this, not you, because you covered this for so long. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1259.1s)]
*  Well, you just said it now, that economics is the path forward. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1261.7s)]
*  No, but I didn't say it instead of self-recognition, instead of the two-state solution. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1266.3s)]
*  I said you asked me about Gaza specifically. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1273.4199999999998s)]
*  The problem in Gaza specifically is the rebuilding of Gaza. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1276.26s)]
*  But if I may, the difference between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Israelis' main concern [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1279.94s)]
*  is security. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1287.78s)]
*  The Palestinian main concern is self-recognition and respect. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1289.86s)]
*  I understand this. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1294.98s)]
*  I understand that in the end of the road, what we need is to have two states, one hopefully [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1296.8600000000001s)]
*  in peace, living in peace, one next to each other. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1305.1s)]
*  One should be stronger than the other, the other one should be demilitarized. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1308.3s)]
*  The economy is, you just asked me specifically about Gaza, but the answer about the Palestinians [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1314.78s)]
*  Yes, I again, I support on the long term and after all security measurements have been [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1321.82s)]
*  implemented, the idea that these two people will separate, but I want to separate from [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1327.9399999999998s)]
*  them, which is not a favor I'm doing the Palestinians, it's for my own good. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1332.98s)]
*  And separating from the Palestinians should come from a position of power because of the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1338.78s)]
*  horrific events that happened to us lately and not so lately. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1344.4199999999998s)]
*  I want to step back for a moment and talk about what's happening inside Israel. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1350.54s)]
*  I mean, the country was reaching a boiling point even before October 7th. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1357.98s)]
*  There were hundreds of thousands of people in the streets every weekend protesting the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1362.6599999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu government's plans for judicial reform. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1366.7s)]
*  You know, reservists were threatening not to serve. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1369.5s)]
*  And there's been this growing conflict between the religious and the secular. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1373.7s)]
*  It seems to me like the country is at war with itself. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1378.62s)]
*  It's as unstable, as unsure as I've ever seen it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1381.22s)]
*  What do you see? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1384.86s)]
*  I agree. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1387.3799999999999s)]
*  I agree and I worried and worried. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1388.58s)]
*  And I feel that this is part of the existential threat. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1391.46s)]
*  And I feel that one of the reasons Hamas has decided to invade us and kill all those people [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1397.9399999999998s)]
*  is because he looked at the Israeli government and he said to himself, well, this is my moment. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1405.94s)]
*  It's not like Hamas didn't want to kill Jews two years ago, three years ago, four years [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1411.5800000000002s)]
*  ago. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1415.18s)]
*  They always wanted to kill Jews, but they felt that the Israeli government is weakening [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1416.18s)]
*  the state in a way it wasn't weakened before. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1420.8200000000002s)]
*  And therefore, this is their chance. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  And they did. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1426.8600000000001s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1428.5s)]
*  I'm as worried as I've ever been for the future of our country. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1429.5s)]
*  For those of us who are history buffs, we know that sometimes it takes only one really [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1435.6599999999999s)]
*  bad government in order to, I don't want to say destroy, but weaken a country from within [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1440.8999999999999s)]
*  significantly. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1449.34s)]
*  And we have the wrong government for what we need. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1450.78s)]
*  And we will need to replace it in order to build a better future. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1455.02s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, thank you very much. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1459.78s)]
*  And it's actually not the complete end of our conversation because I'm going to talk [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1466.22s)]
*  to you in a few days. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1469.62s)]
*  Talk to you soon. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1471.8999999999999s)]
*  After the break, I call Mr. Lapid back. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  This is something we're going to be doing on the show. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1480.1s)]
*  I was glad to be able to put some of my lingering questions to Mr. Lapid. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1482.7s)]
*  And he told me more about why he feels misunderstood. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1487.14s)]
*  So the thing is that now in order to get the sympathy and the empathy of the Western world, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1491.38s)]
*  I have to remind them every five seconds that we are the victims in this, is to me is a [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1496.42s)]
*  horrible idea. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1502.3000000000002s)]
*  This is the interview. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1517.14s)]
*  I'm Lulu Garcia de Varo. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1525.18s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, the reason I wanted to talk to you is because I wanted to understand, you [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1528.9s)]
*  know, what the current Israeli opposition stands for. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1536.3400000000001s)]
*  The opposition that I knew when I was there around 2012, that no longer exists. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1540.42s)]
*  As you know, the left is gone now. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1546.42s)]
*  And so I wanted to sort of understand what kind of opposition you represent. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1549.0200000000002s)]
*  As we've been talking, what I've heard is as it comes to the war, there's really not [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1553.7s)]
*  a lot of opposition at all. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1559.66s)]
*  And Israel is being accused of genocide, of war crimes. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1562.2600000000002s)]
*  And as we've talked, you've defended the conduct of the war and you've referred to yourself [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1567.5400000000002s)]
*  as an Israeli patriot. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1571.3200000000002s)]
*  But I suppose my question is, can patriotism not also be defined as questioning the conduct [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1573.62s)]
*  of this war? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1579.54s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1580.54s)]
*  I assume I was reacting, it is not to you, but to what I feel is the betrayal of the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1583.8999999999999s)]
*  intellectuals. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1592.82s)]
*  Meaning that people, the intellectuals of the West, or some of them, has betrayed the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1595.1799999999998s)]
*  idea of complexity, of is this either genocide or existential war for Israel or are there [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1601.54s)]
*  other options? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1610.62s)]
*  Because what I think is that, and this is my duty as the leader of the Israeli opposition, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1612.3s)]
*  is to tell the Israeli government, you need to handle this war better than you do now. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1617.1s)]
*  We understand the need, of course, to defend the country, to defend the people, to react [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1622.42s)]
*  to what happened on October 7th and to eliminate all Hamas's military capabilities. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1628.1799999999998s)]
*  And on the other hand, to stay what we are, which is a democracy that feels about human [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1633.9399999999998s)]
*  rights, that is doing its best in terms of defending the idea of humanity. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1639.6599999999999s)]
*  And as we have discussed, defend this in circumstances that are no less than horrible. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1646.34s)]
*  And the dialogue I have, or we have, with the outside world is either with people who [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1653.1s)]
*  are chanting slogans they don't really understand or are determined to make this into a one-sided [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1660.5s)]
*  story. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1671.26s)]
*  No, Israel is not committing genocide. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1672.26s)]
*  No, Israel is not doing anything but defend itself in a war we didn't want. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1674.54s)]
*  And these are not pro-government sayings. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1679.58s)]
*  This is just the reality of people who are hurting. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1683.02s)]
*  And the fact that I oppose the government so much doesn't mean I need to oppose the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1687.78s)]
*  idea of self-defense. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1693.26s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1694.98s)]
*  And I feel what I'm thinking about, actually, is just what it means in a moment like this [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1697.1s)]
*  to effectively, even if you care about Israel and the Israelis, say this is not okay. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1706.18s)]
*  You know, earlier you disparaged the young people in the U.S. marching for Palestinian [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1713.6200000000001s)]
*  rights and you say that they're clueless and misled. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1718.22s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're marching for your Palestinian rights. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1721.3s)]
*  I think they're marching against Palestinian rights. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1724.3s)]
*  I think what they're doing is against the best interests of the Palestinian people. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1726.78s)]
*  Yeah, but doesn't that dismiss their sort of legitimate concerns? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1730.6200000000001s)]
*  And the people may have generally about the civilian deaths. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1734.34s)]
*  Well, I think they should understand that there is a reason why everything is happening [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1737.6599999999999s)]
*  is happening. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  And the reason is Hamas. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1745.6599999999999s)]
*  The reason is not Israel. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1747.1s)]
*  I mean, not to be able to even track why what is happening is happening is a total lack [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1748.8999999999999s)]
*  of even, I don't know, intellectual dignity or at least curiosity to what is going on. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1756.74s)]
*  And, you know, I was thinking after our first discussion, I was trying to figure out because [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1764.3s)]
*  I told myself, well, at one point or another, I was defensive and she was defensive. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1768.9s)]
*  Why was it? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1773.78s)]
*  So I don't know about you, but I know about myself. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1774.86s)]
*  And the reason is because I refuse to be involved in the context in which who is the victim. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1777.74s)]
*  I am done being a victim. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1786.66s)]
*  I'm done being a victim since June 1945. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1788.26s)]
*  So the thing is that now in order to get the sympathy and the empathy of the Western world, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1793.46s)]
*  I have to say to remind them every five seconds that we are the victims in this is to me is [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1798.6200000000001s)]
*  a horrible idea. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1805.66s)]
*  I rather tell them, listen, we're fighting for their life and we're going to do whatever [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1806.8200000000002s)]
*  is necessary in order to win this fight because we are done being victims. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1810.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, the more popular thing to do is to go into a fistfight with the Palestinians about [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1814.26s)]
*  the question who is hurting more. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1820.38s)]
*  But this is a pleasure I'm not going to give anyone. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1823.18s)]
*  So maybe this is why I became a bit frustrated in our previous conversation because I was [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1825.82s)]
*  supposed to prove that I am more of a victim than the Palestinians. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1831.8600000000001s)]
*  I am no victim. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1835.38s)]
*  I'm a citizen, a proud citizen of a great country who's fighting for its life and in [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1836.5s)]
*  terrible circumstances, while trying our best not to hurt the Palestinians because [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1841.58s)]
*  they are living here with us and we need to find ways to make sure they have a future [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1847.02s)]
*  as well. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1852.78s)]
*  It's always struck me as a fundamental disconnect because Israel doesn't feel there is enough [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1853.78s)]
*  acknowledgement of the existential threat that they're under. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1859.02s)]
*  You're articulating this right now. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1862.86s)]
*  And Israel's critics on the Palestinian question want Israel to see that it can't be a true [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1865.46s)]
*  democracy with real security when it oppresses and occupies millions of Palestinians. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1870.02s)]
*  So I'm wondering, can you understand that point of view? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1876.46s)]
*  Of course. And since you have covered Israel, then you know, unlike others, the numerous [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1879.78s)]
*  time now that Israel has offered the Palestinians statehood and they refused again and again [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1885.46s)]
*  and again and again. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1892.78s)]
*  But you know, there's another version of this story. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1893.8600000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1896.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there is another version of the story, but it's not the right one. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1897.5800000000002s)]
*  And I was involved, so I know. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1901.14s)]
*  And I want to tell you something else. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1903.38s)]
*  I walked one day to a meeting with a very smart foreign minister. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1905.3400000000001s)]
*  It was years ago. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1912.54s)]
*  She was she was one of the smartest people I know. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1913.38s)]
*  And she came into the room and she started the conversation by telling me that like everybody [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1915.54s)]
*  People always say that. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1922.34s)]
*  So, you know, we recognize Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1923.34s)]
*  And I said, why are you saying this? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1926.54s)]
*  And she said, what do you mean? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1929.26s)]
*  I said, do you go into a meeting with the French foreign minister and tell him that [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1930.54s)]
*  you recognize France's right to defend itself? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1935.6599999999999s)]
*  Is there any other country you tell that they have a right to defend itself? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1939.34s)]
*  Why are you emphasizing the fact? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1943.34s)]
*  I wasn't angry with her. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1945.1s)]
*  I was just curious about the question. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1946.1399999999999s)]
*  Why is it that she felt the need to tell me that I'm entitled to defend myself and not [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1948.02s)]
*  to die silently? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1953.62s)]
*  And now I think you and I have succeeded, which is a great success, to go that far [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1956.22s)]
*  into our conversation without mentioning the possibility that maybe it is because we are [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1961.82s)]
*  Jews, but maybe it is because we are Jews. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1967.22s)]
*  This is something I've heard a lot from Jews outside of Israel and obviously inside Israel. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1971.22s)]
*  But you also know the other side of this, which is that many Palestinians look at the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1978.22s)]
*  context of the occupation, look at how they have been treated, and say that this context [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1985.82s)]
*  isn't as simple as who is the victim of this particular cycle of violence. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=1994.22s)]
*  Well, I don't want this cycle of violence. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2002.02s)]
*  And no Israeli is right. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2004.62s)]
*  We have our own fair share of lunatics. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2006.22s)]
*  I am not going to defend them. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2008.42s)]
*  But the majority of Israelis don't want this cycle of violence. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2009.6200000000001s)]
*  And if somebody will enable us to separate from the Palestinians, meaning if we will [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2013.82s)]
*  have somebody to talk to on the Palestinian side about separating, there will be a vast [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2021.42s)]
*  majority of Israelis for this separation. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2026.6200000000001s)]
*  And the problem is right now, listen, you are hearing it's not against you. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2029.42s)]
*  What you're hearing is frustration because I do not seem to put my mind around the fact [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2035.42s)]
*  that five minutes after the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, we are already [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2042.8200000000002s)]
*  defending ourselves from people who are telling us, well, we question your right to defend [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2049.62s)]
*  yourself because this is, I don't know, it's again, you are part of the white privileged [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2054.2200000000003s)]
*  world and therefore you are not entitled to self-defense. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2061.02s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to me. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2064.82s)]
*  It frustrates me. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2066.02s)]
*  And I hate the idea that I keep telling myself that I'm glad that my father is not alive [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2067.2200000000003s)]
*  to see this. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2072.82s)]
*  Your father, Tommy Lapid, who was, of course, a minister and a Holocaust survivor. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2074.42s)]
*  I remember him well. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2082.02s)]
*  He, his entire life was the way out of the basement in the Budapest ghetto in which the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2083.6200000000003s)]
*  Nazis put him in. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2093.42s)]
*  And then if he was alive now, he would be locked with me and my daughter with special [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2094.62s)]
*  needs in the basement of my house because somebody is trying to kill us again. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2099.82s)]
*  So this, the fact that we do not seem to be able to rescue ourselves from being locked [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2104.82s)]
*  in a basement surrounded by people who wants to kill us is pretty frustrating for the people [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2110.62s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2116.2200000000003s)]
*  This is my last question, but this is a question about the future because, you know, a poll [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2117.82s)]
*  by the Israel Democracy Institute shows that 63% of the Jewish Israeli public now do not [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2125.42s)]
*  support an independent Palestinian state. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2130.82s)]
*  You say that is because of the history and that very well may be true. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2133.02s)]
*  And you've made it very clear where you stand. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2137.02s)]
*  You want to see the Netanyahu government resign. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2140.02s)]
*  You do believe in a two-state solution. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2142.02s)]
*  But it seems that even if Bibi goes, his politics remain popular. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2144.62s)]
*  So where does that leave, I guess, the opposition after this war, the very prospect of peace? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2149.62s)]
*  How do you move Israelis to your side? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2155.62s)]
*  The whole idea. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2159.62s)]
*  I mean, politics can be, as you very well know, horrible, but also sometimes very rarely [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2160.62s)]
*  also beautiful. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2168.62s)]
*  And it is only beautiful is when you get a chance to change people's minds, to talk [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2169.62s)]
*  to them, to be able to communicate to them new ideas. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2175.62s)]
*  And it's always a battle of ideas. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2179.62s)]
*  And it's the only battle worth living for. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2182.62s)]
*  I am, as I said, and you quoted, I'm a patriot. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2184.62s)]
*  And you're right, patriotism is sometimes telling people what they don't want to hear. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2188.62s)]
*  You know, you always have this question about what leadership is and what people think [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2193.62s)]
*  and what people tend to forget is that leadership is always opposite your own people, not the enemy. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2198.62s)]
*  Opposite the enemy, get two good generals and they will fight the war for you. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2203.62s)]
*  And besides, there's simplicity into it because it's a war they are against you, then you [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2208.62s)]
*  have to fight back. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2213.62s)]
*  When you go to your own people and tell them things they don't want to hear and convince [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2214.62s)]
*  them in one way or another, this is what we're going to try and do. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2219.62s)]
*  We're going to try and make the Netanyahu government go away because it's disastrous [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2224.62s)]
*  and dangerous and irresponsible and non-functional on top of this. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2229.62s)]
*  And then we're going to tell the Israelis, we have to make a decision about our future. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2234.62s)]
*  And this decision is going to be based on the idea that I discussed with you that in [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2240.62s)]
*  order to stay the strongest country in the Middle East, we also need to stay the strongest [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2245.62s)]
*  democracy in the Middle East. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2251.62s)]
*  And in order to be that democracy, we have to start the long journey, the 1000 mile, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2253.62s)]
*  the first step of the 1000 mile journey to separate from the Palestinians. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2259.62s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, thank you very much. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2bTbJxS6Cw&t=2269.62s)]
