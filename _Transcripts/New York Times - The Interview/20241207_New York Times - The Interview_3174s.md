# Tilda Swinton Would Like a Word With Trump About His Mother
**New York Times - The Interview:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview. I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=0.0s)]
*  Unexpected connections sometimes arise in this job. As it happens, I had two of them [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=9.6s)]
*  with this week's guest, the Academy Award-winning actress Tilda Swinton. Both of them shaped [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=14.24s)]
*  my feeling about the conversation you're about to hear, though in very different ways. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=19.12s)]
*  Let me tell you about the first one. In a book of sketches by the British writer John [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=23.96s)]
*  Berger called Bento's Sketchbook, one drawing has always mesmerized me. It's of an androgynous [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=27.54s)]
*  face, almost alien, and it exudes this deeply human curiosity and compassion. That sketch [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=33.66s)]
*  is labeled simply Tilda. I hadn't really thought about who it was based on until, that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=39.98s)]
*  is, when in preparation for my interview with Swinton, I watched a documentary she co-directed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=46.14s)]
*  about Berger. In it, she mentioned Bento's Sketchbook, and a light bulb went on. Despite [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=50.58s)]
*  being a long-time admirer of that sketch and Swinton's acting, I'd never put together [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=55.74s)]
*  that I'd been entranced by the same person the whole time. I couldn't help but take that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=60.14s)]
*  as a good omen for the interview. The second connection was tougher to interpret. You might [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=64.54s)]
*  remember that my last interview was with a doctor about medical aid and dying, a subject [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=70.7s)]
*  that I've had recent personal experience with. Swinton's upcoming film, The Room Next Door, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=75.14s)]
*  directed by Pedro Almodovar, is about, and I swear I didn't know this ahead of time, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=80.22s)]
*  an eerily similar topic. In the movie, Swinton plays a woman named Martha, who asks her [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=85.3s)]
*  friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, to support her decision to die by suicide after [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=90.34s)]
*  becoming terminally ill. I would have felt phony or disingenuous not to share this coincidence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=95.38s)]
*  with Swinton, but I can't say I was exactly eager to explore it either. She, as it turns [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=101.2s)]
*  out, felt otherwise. Here's my interview with Tilda Swinton. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=107.22s)]
*  Your new movie, The Room Next Door, is based on a great novel by Sigrid Núñez called [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=116.3s)]
*  What Are You Going Through? And that novel takes its title from a quote by the French [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=122.3s)]
*  philosopher Simone Weil, which is, The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=128.66s)]
*  means being able to say to him, What are you going through? So let me ask you, in the Simone [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=134.14s)]
*  Weil sense of the question, what are you going through? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=140.62s)]
*  I'm enjoying right now the attention to that question and the fact that our film puts that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=146.18s)]
*  question into the air. The idea of bearing witness and the question of what is friendship, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=154.34s)]
*  but even more than friendship. What is it to coexist? What is it to not look away? I [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=163.06s)]
*  think of it actually as a political film because of that question that it just, it's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=170.42s)]
*  like a balloon that we launched above people's heads. How is it possible to coexist and how [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  is it possible to bear witness? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=183.06s)]
*  I have some questions about how people might think about that, but I want to preface them [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  by sharing what I hope is sort of a morbidly humorous anecdote related to the film. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=191.94s)]
*  Sounds good. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  We'll see. So the last interview I did was with a doctor in Canada who performs medical [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  assistance in dying. She helps people to die. And the occasion of doing that interview was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  my mother's haven't gone through that process earlier this year. So it was kind of a heavy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=213.62s)]
*  interview for me. And then afterwards the opportunity arose to interview you and I thought, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=218.74s)]
*  oh great, I love Tilda Swinton's movies. And then I saw you were doing the director [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=225.74s)]
*  of the room next door is Almodovar. And I thought, again, oh, I love the exuberance [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=230.34s)]
*  of his work. This will be great. So then I went to the screening, I got a popcorn, I [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=234.22s)]
*  got my Diet Coke from a soda fountain, which is this guilty pleasure of mine. I even got [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=240.34s)]
*  some M&Ms. I get down to my seat. I'm feeling good. I'm sitting there and within a few minutes [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  it dawns on me that your movie is about assisted suicide. So thank you, Tilda. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  Welcome. And I have to ask you, how did you feel at the end when you stood up and there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=255.66s)]
*  were M&Ms all around your feet and you had a sugar rush headache? Because what you've [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=263.14s)]
*  described is quite a banquet of experience. Your experience with your mother, your experience [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=267.62s)]
*  with this doctor, and then to see a piece of art that's also swimming in the same material. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=275.58s)]
*  How did you feel in relation to the other two experiences? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=283.34s)]
*  Oh, boy, I felt well, sort of like I was suggesting I was not immediately jazzed to be made to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=288.06s)]
*  revisit my emotions so soon. But I also felt glad that the subject was being treated in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  an emotionally truthful way. And then I have to say, and I really am not just saying this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=310.02s)]
*  because I'm talking to you now, I did feel some catharsis in sort of revisiting the emotions [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=314.14s)]
*  through having seen them depicted in the film. How does that ring for you? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=320.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm really pleased to hear that. I mean, I think the reason I ask the question is that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=327.73999999999995s)]
*  I'm thinking of what you just said, which is such a particular experience that you had [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=332.17999999999995s)]
*  to come to a piece of art, having been through the real lived experience with your mother, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=338.78s)]
*  which is particularly piquant, can we say. So there's that, which we can unpack in a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=346.94s)]
*  minute if we want to, or maybe another time when we speak. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=353.18s)]
*  I'm sure the audience has had enough of me being upset about my mother, but I'll move [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=356.74s)]
*  on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know what? Here's the thing, David. You know, moving on is, I think, in many ways [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=361.41999999999996s)]
*  grossly overrated. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=365.78s)]
*  Can I ask you, because I know that you've had experiences somewhat similar to the experience [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=368.38s)]
*  depicted in the film. You have been with people near the end. Can you tell me about your experience [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=374.42s)]
*  with that and how that may have made its way into the film? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=383.18s)]
*  Yes, it's an enormous part of what I want to talk to you about, because it is the reason [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=388.38s)]
*  this film is so important to me. I have spent much of the last 15 years in the Ingrid position, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=393.84s)]
*  naming the person that Julianne Moore plays. And it's felt like that on almost all occasions [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=402.84s)]
*  to both of my parents, to the father of my children, and many other friends. But it's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=410.56s)]
*  also something that has been in my lived experience since I was quite a young person. I mean, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=417.28s)]
*  my first Martha was Derek Jarman. Derek Jarman, when I was 33, died. He was the first person [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=422.92s)]
*  who I knew very closely and lived alongside very, very tightly, who got very ill, first [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  of all, with HIV in 1988, 1989, and then died in 94 after those years that we, for those [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  of us who had that secondhand experience, that witness experience, know was a pretty [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=448.7s)]
*  torturous journey. He was the first person that I met who was looking down the barrel [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=455.14s)]
*  and did not look away. And I was very much in the Ingrid position, the person that Julianne [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=462.98s)]
*  Moore plays is really frightened. I was that person. I knew that life, mortal life comes [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=471.66s)]
*  to an end. But I always feel that immortality and mortality are basically the same thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=478.3s)]
*  But what Derek modeled for me was something that has really influenced my perspective [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=483.58s)]
*  on the whole charade, if you like, his absolute refusal to look away. There was a sort of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=491.82s)]
*  exhilaration for him to have the limit of his life made clear to him. He was almost [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=502.22s)]
*  gleeful. And he just drove into the curve. And he became sort of enlivened by it. And [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=508.14000000000004s)]
*  I would say that the last few years of his life, notwithstanding the illness and the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  pain and suffering that he went through on a physical level, was, you know, I think he [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=524.1s)]
*  said were some of the most joyful years of his life. And I felt, what I witnessed was someone who just [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=530.14s)]
*  made his dying alive. It was entirely lived. And his death was not interesting. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=542.3s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=551.9s)]
*  There's nothing interesting about death. It's just we just stop. For me personally, death itself, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  is not the star of the show. The dying is the interesting bit. And how do we die? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=559.26s)]
*  You said immortality and mortality for you are the same thing. What do you mean? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  None of us are getting out of here alive. It's not just unlucky people who die. It's every living [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  creature. And that's what life is. It's so banal to have to say this. But one does have to say it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=576.14s)]
*  because there's so much denial around it. And I've heard so many people who are living with [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=581.82s)]
*  a cancer that is finally going to take them away, that there is a sort of vernacular around this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=589.82s)]
*  sort of battle terminology. And you're either a winner or you're a loser. It's all about fighting. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=596.22s)]
*  And it's such a distraction. It's such a red herring, that attitude, because it brings with [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=603.74s)]
*  it the concept that we might win. It's like- [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=609.18s)]
*  Well, also the flip side is as if somebody who loses didn't fight hard enough, which is sort of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=612.8599999999999s)]
*  an insult. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=619.3399999999999s)]
*  But more than an insult, I agree with you it's an insult. And it's just a waste, because that's not [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=620.62s)]
*  the point of being alive. The point of being alive is that we know it's limited and there's no magic, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=628.3s)]
*  there's no rabbit up your sleeve that you can pull. I remember when I was with my mother, beside my [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  mother when she was dying. And I found that borderline traumatic, the fact that there was [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=640.38s)]
*  nothing that could be done. And I remember sitting there thinking, is there no mortality police we [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=647.26s)]
*  can call? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=652.94s)]
*  You mean to stop it from happening? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  To just, like, this is barbaric, this death thing. Surely this is not right. And I remember [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=655.58s)]
*  feeling that with childbirth as well. I thought, what? This is, what? This is medieval, pre-medieval [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=661.82s)]
*  torture. Can't we have fixed it by now? This brutality? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=669.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, just hearing you talk about your mom, I've read you elsewhere refer to feeling like a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=675.74s)]
*  foundling as a child, you know, sort of like you were being raised in a family that was not your [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=683.5s)]
*  own. I know you grew up in a sort of aristocratic Scottish military family that could trace its [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=688.06s)]
*  ancestry back a thousand years. And I'm wondering if you can tell me more about why you felt sort of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=694.14s)]
*  displaced as a child. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's so wonderful that you recount that back to me, David, because in the last few years, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=705.0999999999999s)]
*  and it actually really started with my mother's departure, which was 12 years ago, my father died [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=710.6199999999999s)]
*  six years ago. I have realized that that was a complete ruse that I was led to believe, not on [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=715.26s)]
*  my part, but I was sort of systematically misled. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=722.7s)]
*  Misled about what? I'm not quite following. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  About being an artist, being such a, being such a, and I've realized since my parents died that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  there are artists scattered through my family. My great grandmother was a great, great singer who [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=732.78s)]
*  had a salon with Gabrielle Foray in London. And she was a great singer of Lida in drawing rooms, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=738.22s)]
*  around the Belmond, around Europe. And she was born in St. Petersburg. She was a great muse of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=745.26s)]
*  John Singer Sargent. There's an incredibly beautiful portrait of her that hangs in the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=751.8199999999999s)]
*  Art Institute in Chicago. And I'm privileged to say that I now have the custody of two [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=757.5s)]
*  extraordinary drawings by Sargent of her. They were very close friends. And one of these drawings [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=764.22s)]
*  was above the television in our family sitting room. And she used to look at me over the top [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=771.26s)]
*  of the television for all of my teenage years when we were watching Starsky and Hutch and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=777.1s)]
*  Morecambe and Wise and all the good stuff. But she had her eye on me. And her artistic [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=783.74s)]
*  eminence was underplayed by my parents who were not artists. And I don't think they quite [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=793.66s)]
*  understood it. I think they were rather, honestly, I think they'd forgive me for saying rather [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=798.06s)]
*  frightened of artists. Why? I don't know. I think they... Why? I remember very distinctly a moment [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=802.2199999999999s)]
*  when my father was a... He once had his portrait painted. And a painter came to the house. And I [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=810.78s)]
*  was about nine, I suppose. And I remember this sort of frisson in the air. A painter is coming [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=819.02s)]
*  to paint Daddy. And I remember when this man came, I didn't see him. I remember looking down [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=826.62s)]
*  a corridor knowing that a painting was taking place down this corridor. And the light was on. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=834.54s)]
*  And I knew that my father was in there with an artist. It's like being in there with a wild lion [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=841.58s)]
*  or something. But this is something that you came to understand in your family. You did have artists [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=848.14s)]
*  in your lineage later. Do you remember feeling as if you were consciously trying to rebel [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=853.98s)]
*  against your family by becoming an artist? It didn't really feel like that to me. I just [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=861.1800000000001s)]
*  needed to find my company. And the first sort of practicing artist I ever met was a boy. I was at [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=867.1s)]
*  a girls school in Kent. And there was a boys school just down the road. And I met... I can't even [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=875.34s)]
*  remember how I met him. But I met this boy called Johnny who was at this boys school. And he was [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=881.42s)]
*  into art. And we were like art nerds. And I used to escape the school to meet him. And it wasn't [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=887.74s)]
*  remotely romantic. But it was very sexy, actually, because we were having these clandestine meetings [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=894.9399999999999s)]
*  talking about art and showing each other our drawings. So it did have a kind of erotic feel, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=901.0999999999999s)]
*  but we were not involved. Or we weren't involved sexually. But there was this... I knew, and I must [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=907.66s)]
*  have been about 15, 16 when this happened. So I knew that there were other people. And I just was [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=913.5s)]
*  looking for them and didn't find them for a long time. I mean, here's something that I was telling [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=920.62s)]
*  somebody yesterday. At this school I was at, we weren't allowed music, which I think is a terrible [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=926.3s)]
*  abuse to a growing sensibility. And particularly in the 70s, I mean, think what we were missing out. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=931.9s)]
*  But that's probably why they were doing it. They were sort of keeping us away from the sex pistols. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=938.4599999999999s)]
*  And this is a boarding school you went to? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=941.98s)]
*  A boarding school. And I remember when I was about 13, seeing the cover of Aladdin Sane. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=943.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, the David Bowie album. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=950.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=951.34s)]
*  The famous one with the lightning bolt painted across his face. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=951.8199999999999s)]
*  With the gingery hair. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=954.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=956.78s)]
*  And this pearlescent... [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=957.26s)]
*  Little drop on the collarbone, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=959.66s)]
*  Yes. The mercury collarbone. And I recognized him. He looked so familiar to me. And I bought this [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=961.34s)]
*  record with my Christmas money. And I didn't have a turntable. And I couldn't play it for years. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=967.5s)]
*  I didn't hear Aladdin Sane. I owned it. I knew that it was something. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=972.7s)]
*  Did you imagine what it sounded like? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=977.58s)]
*  Yes, I think I did. But it wasn't the point. It was the vision, not the sound at that point. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=980.7800000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, of course, when I knew it sounded like I was hook, line and sinker. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=987.1800000000001s)]
*  But anyway, the point being, it was the art. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=991.74s)]
*  But initially you wanted to be a writer. And this is something that I was particularly interested in. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=995.9s)]
*  From a young age, you were writing poetry and people were reading what you were doing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1001.1s)]
*  And then you got to Cambridge intending to be a writer. And then for some reason, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1005.58s)]
*  around about the age of 21, you stopped writing. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1010.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1013.4200000000001s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1014.14s)]
*  It was really quite traumatic because it was what I was. It wasn't that I wanted to be a writer. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1015.6600000000001s)]
*  I was a writer. And to a certain extent, David, and I have the nerve to say this to you, I still am. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1022.3000000000001s)]
*  I find it difficult to describe myself really internally as anything else. I certainly find [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1029.02s)]
*  it very difficult to describe myself as an actor. But I was a writer. I was a poet as a child. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1033.74s)]
*  I invested my energies in that. And for what it's worth, and it's worth a lot when you're young, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1040.5400000000002s)]
*  I won poetry competitions. And that's why I wanted to go to university. And I got my place, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1046.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm embarrassed to say, at Cambridge as a writer. I got an exhibition as a writer. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1052.22s)]
*  What was your poetry about? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1056.22s)]
*  What was it about? It was about nature, mainly, I think. There was one, I was looking for it the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1058.7s)]
*  other day, where is it? One particular one, which was about a swan that I found on the river at home. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1064.7s)]
*  That one, quite again, it's embarrassing to say. I mean, I was, whatever, 15, a kind of poetry prize. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1071.18s)]
*  And I was very proud of that. And it was more than my identity. It was my solace. I was quite [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1079.42s)]
*  a solitary child. And my writing was my, that was my company. It's important that I stress that, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1085.9s)]
*  because when I stopped writing, and you ask why, I mean, we could have a whole masterclass on that. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1093.1s)]
*  Wait, but why did it happen? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1101.98s)]
*  Well, I could blame somebody. I could blame the program for just inundating me with too much. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1104.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to blame somebody. That's silly. I clearly didn't have the confidence [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1113.02s)]
*  to hold my flame in that headwind of other voices. And so when I got to Cambridge, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1117.58s)]
*  there was a lot of teaching and there was a barrage of amazing noise, but it just, I was just, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1127.74s)]
*  I was like a tortoise. I just put my head in. And so I was bereft. I was truly bereft at that time, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1134.78s)]
*  because I'd lost my company. And then I met friends, a couple of writers particularly, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1140.86s)]
*  who were writing plays. And they said, come and be a part of this society. And I started being in [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1146.9399999999998s)]
*  the plays to hang out with them. So I was very much a performer by default and very much led [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1153.1799999999998s)]
*  by the company. And that's, frankly, that's all she wrote. That's the way I work. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1160.54s)]
*  What? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1166.06s)]
*  You know, I think when The Room Next Door was shown at the New York Film Festival, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1167.58s)]
*  I think it was just last month, maybe, there was a post screening talk and it was interrupted by [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1171.98s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protesters. And you, I thought very gracefully in the moment, you know, said the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1178.54s)]
*  protests were, I'm paraphrasing, uncomfortable, but necessary and also relevant to the film, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1185.82s)]
*  Syria, Beirut, Gaza, represent also The Room Next Door. And the film is asking people to be in The [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1192.22s)]
*  Room Next Door and to not look away from what's happening. And is it your hope that people would [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1198.0600000000002s)]
*  sort of make a political connection or have political connections spurred in that way by [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1204.14s)]
*  seeing the film? I want to say, I'm very glad you bring that up, actually, David, because I would [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1210.0600000000002s)]
*  like to make very clear that I did include in that list of places, Moscow and Tel Aviv and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1215.82s)]
*  Jerusalem. It's really important to me to mark that when it was reported, the names of those places [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1225.34s)]
*  was not mentioned. And I think we have to be very careful about that. Because if I was making a [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1232.7s)]
*  point at all, the point I was making is that we are absolutely in The Room Next Door to everyone [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1239.26s)]
*  all the time. The film is about not looking away on a micro and a macro level. And it was a very [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1247.02s)]
*  interesting moment because here's the thing, those people who came to make a statement in that room, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1254.46s)]
*  I believe dignified that room. And it was of interest to me that Pedro and I, as Europeans, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1263.8200000000002s)]
*  in concert immediately offered them our microphones. And that that was apparently remarkable. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1274.8600000000001s)]
*  It's something to do with the fact that we are brought up in unarmed societies. I talked to my [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1284.78s)]
*  American friends afterwards, and it never occurred to me that somebody coming in with a banner might [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1290.94s)]
*  be armed. But that's my privilege. But also, the idea of being frightened of free speech [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1296.06s)]
*  is something we really have to take on. And it is true, I did say it is uncomfortable. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1305.26s)]
*  But that doesn't mean it wasn't the right thing for them to do it, and that we didn't welcome them. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1312.86s)]
*  It's also true, by the way, we didn't hear what they wanted to say very well, because they were [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1317.58s)]
*  masked. And I would say to them, next time, don't be masked. Don't mask yourselves, because we want [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1322.54s)]
*  to hear what you have to say. And then you can say it clearly, and own that presence, that statement, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1330.6999999999998s)]
*  that gesture, and be clear. It's entirely possible that they were wearing masks for [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1336.62s)]
*  apprehensiveness about legal reprisals. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1342.3s)]
*  Well, that is the lead that I buried. You're absolutely right to mention that. And we need to look at that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1344.3s)]
*  Are we really content to live in a society where someone making a very valid point publicly, in a completely appropriate setting, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1352.3s)]
*  is frightened that they will be persecuted for doing that essentially non-threatening thing? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1362.3s)]
*  You know, this is a question I don't know that I would have asked before November 5th and Donald Trump's election. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1370.3s)]
*  But you know, you cut your teeth as an artist in the mid-80s, late 80s, working with Derek Jarman, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1380.3s)]
*  sort of making avant-garde queer cinema that he directed. And this, of course, is happening, you know, in the middle of Margaret Thatcher's England. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1388.3s)]
*  An extremely conservative time in that country's history. And is there anything that you learned about being an artist [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1398.3s)]
*  in that cultural and political atmosphere that perhaps feels useful to you in this moment, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1408.3s)]
*  when right-wing politics and right-wing sentiment are again dominant? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1416.3s)]
*  Yes. I left London in 1997 when my children were born and went to live in the north of Scotland, where I've lived ever since. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1423.3s)]
*  And I never went back to London for years. But I happened to be there last autumn for a few weeks. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1433.3s)]
*  And it was really interesting because both of my children at the time were living in London. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1441.3s)]
*  And they were both 26, which was an age I was in London. And so I was very much awash with nostalgia. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1447.3s)]
*  And I was constantly making beautiful plans to meet up with my children. And I realized that every Saturday they were marching. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1455.3s)]
*  And it was, it struck me so deeply that that's what I was doing when I was 26. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1464.3s)]
*  Every Saturday we were marching for one thing or another, whether it was against the Iraq War, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1473.3s)]
*  whether it was against Clause 28, which was the repressive bill that Thatcher was... [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1478.3s)]
*  Basically a homophobic bill. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1483.3s)]
*  A homophobic bill. And we campaigned long and hard against that. Or whether it was in support of the miners' strike. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1484.3s)]
*  We were constantly in Trafalgar Square. And my children were too. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1492.3s)]
*  And I realized that there was something in me that was grateful for them that they have this experience. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1499.3s)]
*  I mean, long live the opportunity to assemble freely and to protest, especially as a young person and especially as a young artist. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1509.3s)]
*  But my question is, in my mind, more about the potential efficacy and utility of art when it comes to protest and in moving people's politics. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1520.3s)]
*  How much of an effect do you think art can have in that regard? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1532.3s)]
*  Well, that brings me back to a question that I kind of asked you again. I probably wasn't clear right at the beginning of our conversation. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1537.3s)]
*  When you explained that you'd had these three experiences with the concept of death with dignity, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1545.3s)]
*  experience with your mother, the conversation with the doctor, and then seeing a piece of art. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1553.3s)]
*  And I asked you a question and we went off of another alley. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1559.3s)]
*  So I'm asking it again. What do you think in terms of those three experiences, what did the art manage to do for you? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1563.3s)]
*  I think there are feelings I have and to see them reflected in the art or even tested against the art tempers them with a flame sort of. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1572.3s)]
*  I sort of walk away with the feelings and ideas more deeply held often for me. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1587.3s)]
*  And I know this is not the question you ask, but I've become more much more skeptical over time that film or music or literature can do more than galvanize. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1594.3s)]
*  That they can actually change feeling or precipitate a political feeling or idea that was not held in the person before. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1605.3s)]
*  And what's your response to that? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1615.3s)]
*  I suggest that what art does, first of all, it offers us an opportunity to be quiet and to be still. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1618.3s)]
*  And not necessarily to go inward, but to allow in that gesture of stillness for the sort of reverberation of whatever we're witnessing to a connection to form. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1638.3s)]
*  So, for example, again, sorry to use the use the example of your three, your triptych of experiences around this material. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1654.3s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1663.3s)]
*  Your experience with your mother, not to be reductive, was lived and I imagine, and I don't want to take any liberties here, but it's such a car crash that experience one so in it and one doesn't know what one's doing. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1664.3s)]
*  But one's in it and it's happening and it's crashing over your head and you're just staying alive and surviving it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1678.3s)]
*  I'm sorry if that doesn't sound representative. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1685.3s)]
*  Slow motion car crash. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1688.3s)]
*  Slow motion car crash. Yeah, it's so true. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1690.3s)]
*  But still point being, there's nothing you can do. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1692.3s)]
*  So that's an encounter with helplessness, right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1695.3s)]
*  The actual lived experience is an encounter with helplessness and trying to survive it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1697.3s)]
*  How can I bear this helplessness, this powerlessness? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1701.3s)]
*  And then you do. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1705.3s)]
*  And then your conversation with the doctor, again, I'm imagining, I'm making this up now, but I imagine was intellectually very stimulating. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1706.3s)]
*  You were talking about ideas. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1713.3s)]
*  And then when you're sitting in the dark and you're watching a film, here is an opportunity for you to look on something being played out in front of you. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1715.3s)]
*  You're seeing us playing it out in front of you. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1730.3s)]
*  The levels of distance, which are very soothing to the nervous system. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1733.3s)]
*  So you're not taken back into the state. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1738.3s)]
*  You're able to observe rather like in a meditation state. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1740.3s)]
*  And then you can make these connections. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1746.3s)]
*  I think the sort of superpower that art has is this distance that it affords us, this capacity to be still and to allow these resonances to arise. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1751.3s)]
*  From inside. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1762.3s)]
*  So I think that we may encounter new thinking when we encounter art. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1763.3s)]
*  But in order for it to really start to grow, it needs to connect with something inside you. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1770.3s)]
*  And in the instance that you describe of your triptych experience, I think it's a great palate cleanser to go through a traumatic experience, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1779.3s)]
*  to see it played out in the safe environment of, I hope, a movie theater in the dark with strangers. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1790.3s)]
*  With Fountain Diet Coke. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1797.3s)]
*  With a lot of Diet Coke and as many M&Ms as you can crunch into the carpet afterwards. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1798.3s)]
*  That is the optimal experience. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1804.3s)]
*  That's when the connections do get made. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1810.3s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1812.3s)]
*  I don't mean to belabor this. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1815.3s)]
*  It's just one thing I want to add to the politics and art conversation. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1816.3s)]
*  And I realize I'm probably just a grouch about this now at this point. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1821.3s)]
*  But I used to really feel like consuming art was sufficient when it came to forming a political identity and political engagement. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1825.3s)]
*  And I just think over time, I think, oh, gosh, I should have spent a lot more time and energy out in the street and less time and energy in the theater or with headphones on. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1835.3s)]
*  I realize I'm rambling now, but these are just things that I've been thinking about. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1849.3s)]
*  I'm liking everything you're saying. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1853.3s)]
*  And I'm surfing the wave of it. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1855.3s)]
*  It's not a ramble at all. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1857.3s)]
*  It's great. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1860.3s)]
*  It's so interesting all of this because I think what I feel like asking in response to your question or your remarks is why do we have to choose? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1862.3s)]
*  I mean, the real question is who are we and how must we live? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1877.3s)]
*  It's about the living. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1884.3s)]
*  The living is the most important thing and in many ways the only thing. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1886.3s)]
*  And I don't necessarily want to designate one thing as political activism and another thing as artistic practice and another thing as living your life. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1892.3s)]
*  I mean, for me, there ain't no walls between any of them. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1903.3s)]
*  But also when I met Derek Jarman and the people with whom I worked in the first years of my life as a practicing artist, I wouldn't say I was taught any of this, but I was encouraged in this view and this perspective and this investment. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1907.3s)]
*  Because I would say that they felt the same. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1921.3s)]
*  The people that I first started working as an artist with, the life and the living of it was everything. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1924.3s)]
*  So when we were working together and I worked with Derek Jarman for what, nine years before he died, the thing was that the films, I always say that the life and the conversation was the tree and the films were like leaves. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1930.3s)]
*  They just came out of the end of the branches. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1951.3s)]
*  They grew out of the conversation and the conversation grew out of the life we were living. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1953.3s)]
*  I remember Derek coming to me and I'm unapologetically talking about Derek a lot because he's the root of all of this for me and my experience with him. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1960.3s)]
*  I remember him, he always used to go on Sundays, we used to go to Camden Market to shop in the, you know, Brick-a-Brack. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1968.3s)]
*  And I remember I met him for lunch one day after, I couldn't go in the morning and I went to his flat in Soho and he produced this incredibly beautiful piece of cream woven cloth, like really beautiful hand woven thing. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1976.3s)]
*  I don't know where it had come from. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1990.3s)]
*  And he said to me, I just bought this from an antique dealer in Camden Lock for one thousand pounds and I'm going to make a film out of it. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=1992.3s)]
*  And that film became The Garden, which is one of his masterpieces. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2002.3s)]
*  But he bought the cloth first to be the shroud of Christ at the beginning and the heart of this film. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2007.3s)]
*  It was the buying of the cloth, the expenditure of one thousand pounds, which was just beyond anything that any of us could afford, the investment. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2016.3s)]
*  But it all started with going to Camden Lock on a Sunday morning. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2026.3s)]
*  Does that explain this attitude? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2030.3s)]
*  The life came first. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2032.3s)]
*  The life always comes first and the work comes out of the life. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2034.3s)]
*  But here's another thing that I wanted to say, we could always pick this up tomorrow, but it's just again like the leaf has come out of our conversation, David. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2038.3s)]
*  I was thinking about what we were talking about just a beat before about this resonance in the theatre, that place of witness and that openness to resonance. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2047.3s)]
*  And this is a huge thing I'm just about to say. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2059.3s)]
*  I'm going to say this is a bombshell. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2063.3s)]
*  I'm just going to say it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2064.3s)]
*  Lay down. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2065.3s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2066.3s)]
*  The thing I want to talk about and we'll talk about it tomorrow is people's innate goodness. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2067.3s)]
*  I wonder whether art isn't a call to our innate goodness and an opportunity to connect with that. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2073.3s)]
*  In the first instance, of course, the empathy machine that cinema in particular is. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2086.3s)]
*  I mean, art is a massive empathy machine, but cinema in particular, that M&M Diet Coke place in the dark is an invitation to step into other people's shoes. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2092.3s)]
*  I mean, it's such a massive gesture of agape, isn't it? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2106.3s)]
*  That I wonder. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2112.3s)]
*  This is I'm seeing you and raising you and you're wondering, OK, my wondering is, is about people's innate goodness. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2114.3s)]
*  And since you mentioned November the 5th and we've talked about the rise of the meanness of right wing politics, let's name it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2123.3s)]
*  Let's use a word that is appropriate here. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2133.3s)]
*  Meanness of that across the planet. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2137.3s)]
*  What oil might get through that grease? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2141.3s)]
*  What? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2144.3s)]
*  How might one be able to connect, reconnect with the innate goodness? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2145.3s)]
*  And I don't want to assume that anybody else believes in innate goodness, but I'm declaring that I do. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2151.3s)]
*  I do believe we were all little children, scared little animals once, all of us, including all of those people that we're thinking about. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2157.3s)]
*  They were all little children. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2166.3s)]
*  And I don't know what happened to them to make them this mean, but we have to contact them somehow. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2168.3s)]
*  We have to find a way of reconnecting with that. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2174.3s)]
*  I have lots of thoughts in response to that. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2180.3s)]
*  So it's good. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2183.3s)]
*  Can you see on them? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2185.3s)]
*  And we'll pick this back up tomorrow. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2187.3s)]
*  See you tomorrow. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2190.3s)]
*  It's one of my most favorite things to say. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2191.3s)]
*  I love saying see you tomorrow. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2194.3s)]
*  After the break, I called Tilda Swinton back and she tells me why I should be less skeptical of the power of art. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2198.3s)]
*  There's this tendency in the far right to encourage us all to give up on human connection and entirely be self-serving and cynical about the notion of connection. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2205.3s)]
*  They would love us to give up. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2220.3s)]
*  This is The Interview. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2243.3s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2244.3s)]
*  So we'll get to where we left off with the question of art and human goodness. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2248.3s)]
*  Yes, art and human goodness. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2254.3s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2256.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2258.3s)]
*  But I was hoping maybe to briefly travel down a couple other highways and byways first. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2259.3s)]
*  But, you know, I noticed that often in conversation, including in our conversation and in other interviews of yours that I've seen and read, you downplay the idea of yourself as an actor. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2265.3s)]
*  And you say, you know, you don't know anything about acting. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2276.3s)]
*  You don't want to know anything about acting. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2278.3s)]
*  But you've been acting extremely well and with obvious great care for a lifetime now. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2280.3s)]
*  You haven't just inspector Cluzoed your way into a successful career. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2288.3s)]
*  Great reference. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2292.3s)]
*  I love that. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2293.3s)]
*  So why are you so invested in self-deprecation when it comes to acting? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2295.3s)]
*  It strikes me as a faint on some level, but I want to hear you explain it to me. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2301.3s)]
*  It strikes you as a faint. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2304.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2306.3s)]
*  It's just accuracy, David. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2307.3s)]
*  I think it has something to do with the kind of my origin story. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2309.3s)]
*  I never set out to be an actor. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2314.3s)]
*  You are completely right. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2318.3s)]
*  I have been what they call acting for quite a long time now. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2319.3s)]
*  And whether it's well made or not is kind of not the point. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2324.3s)]
*  But I think I'm so aware that this endeavor, both being an actor and being seen to be an actor, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2331.3s)]
*  is something that, as far as I can see, most people who undertake it take very, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2339.3s)]
*  very seriously and expend a lot of energy in sort of preserving. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2345.3s)]
*  And I would feel a fraud if I sort of made noises that implied that I was one of them. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2350.3s)]
*  And I would rather get there first before somebody calls me a fraud. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2357.3s)]
*  And the fact that I haven't stopped and I've continued to be invited into things means that it's not so bad. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2362.3s)]
*  But being good is not really the point for me. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2371.3s)]
*  It's interesting that you said you're not so concerned about being good. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2377.3s)]
*  I'm thinking about that in contrast with perhaps how you felt about writing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2383.3s)]
*  And one of the ways that you put it was, you know, you didn't have the confidence to sort of hold your flame in the headwinds. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2388.3s)]
*  But why is sort of your disposition towards acting different than your disposition towards writing was? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2394.3s)]
*  I suppose off the top of my head, because. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2403.3s)]
*  OK, this is actually a really important point, and maybe this makes it even clearer. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2410.3s)]
*  I work as a performer in concert, in communication, in conversation with my colleagues, and I write alone. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2416.3s)]
*  And one of the things that keeps attaching me to performing is the comradeship of the collective activity of it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2427.3s)]
*  And it seems to take more for me to sit and write alone. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2436.3s)]
*  And I'm still waiting for the life to clear enough for there to be an actual sort of oasis in which I can do that. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2443.3s)]
*  But I have been choosing. I don't want to sound like a victim of my own life, but I have been choosing to be working in conversation with other people. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2451.3s)]
*  And I think when I hear and read what real actors talk about, they seem to talk a lot about existing alone and putting their work together by themselves. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2461.3s)]
*  And that's, again, just not the way I work. I work entirely collectively. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2472.3s)]
*  Can I wrench the conversation in a ridiculous direction just for a second? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2480.3s)]
*  Sounds good. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2485.3s)]
*  Just because I'm a sucker for the paranormal. My understanding is you live in the highlands of Scotland, not too far from Loch Ness. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2486.3s)]
*  Oh, very near Loch Ness. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2495.3s)]
*  Have you ever seen any evidence of the monster? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2497.3s)]
*  I have seen evidence of a friend of mine who has lived in a static caravan beside Loch Ness for, oh, I think, pretty much 20, maybe even 20 more years because he once saw the Loch Ness monster. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2500.3s)]
*  He says he saw it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2516.3s)]
*  He says he did see it. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2517.3s)]
*  Well, he saw something. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2519.3s)]
*  And he lives there now waiting for a second bite of the cherry. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2521.3s)]
*  And he's very happy. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2524.3s)]
*  And he makes little statues of the Loch Ness monster and sells them. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2527.3s)]
*  And that's how he sustains himself while he's waiting. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2533.3s)]
*  So that I do know. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2536.3s)]
*  Yeah, Loch Ness is what why wouldn't one believe in the Loch Ness monster? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2538.3s)]
*  Anyway, it's impossible to prove that there isn't one. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2544.3s)]
*  It's rather like dinosaur civilizations. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2547.3s)]
*  There is no proof that dinosaurs did not develop cell phone technology. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2550.3s)]
*  There's no proof. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2556.3s)]
*  No proof dinosaurs didn't create cell phones. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2557.3s)]
*  But hey, we have to keep open. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2560.3s)]
*  We have to be open to the possibility of wonder. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2562.3s)]
*  We live in hope. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2565.3s)]
*  We live in hope. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2567.3s)]
*  So now I want to get back to where we ended before. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2568.3s)]
*  OK. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2573.3s)]
*  You raised the idea that, or you posed the question that art might be a call to our innate goodness. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2574.3s)]
*  And I have a very hard time buying that notion. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2580.3s)]
*  But I would very much like to be disabused of my skepticism around that. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2584.3s)]
*  And I just think there is so much art, even great art, that speaks to the worst of humanity. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2589.3s)]
*  You know, you could look at Lenny Riefenstahl's films, you know, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2596.3s)]
*  or the writing of Celine or a million other examples. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2600.3s)]
*  And I don't see these things as having anything to do with innate goodness. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2607.3s)]
*  I think maybe you could say that the thing that art allows us to do is to tell the truth about humanity [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2611.3s)]
*  and show it in all its dimensions. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2617.3s)]
*  But that's not quite the same thing as any sort of call to goodness. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2619.3s)]
*  So tell me I'm wrong. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2624.3s)]
*  OK. Can I just ask a question before? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2626.3s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2630.3s)]
*  Why do you have a gag reflex about the idea of innate goodness? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2631.3s)]
*  Oh, I don't have a gagging point about the idea of innate goodness in general. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2635.3s)]
*  I think, you know, love is an innately good thing. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2639.3s)]
*  I think, you know, you could say life is innately good. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2643.3s)]
*  But I do find myself increasingly skeptical about the idea of art as being in any way inherently positive. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2647.3s)]
*  If we accept that art can be positive, I don't understand how we could not accept that it can also be negative. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2657.3s)]
*  I think there's something a little naively optimistic about the idea of art as innately good in any form. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2664.3s)]
*  OK. I think I want to move the goalposts a tiny bit. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2672.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2676.3s)]
*  Maybe I'm conflating truth telling and innate goodness. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2677.3s)]
*  Maybe that's what I'm doing. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2680.3s)]
*  Maybe that's the prism through which you could see what I'm trying to say. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2681.3s)]
*  OK. Let's talk about Lenny Riefenstahl for one second. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2685.3s)]
*  The fact that watching Lenny Riefenstahl's work and finding oneself stirred by it on any level, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2689.3s)]
*  aesthetic probably because she was a great aestheticist. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2698.3s)]
*  That was her power. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2702.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2704.3s)]
*  To feel ourselves stirred by that is an opportunity for us to notice in ourselves the stirrings [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2705.3s)]
*  and notice in ourselves the dangers of those stirrings and to just, as you say, truthfully assess and weigh up [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2713.3s)]
*  and learn about ourselves that we are susceptible. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2722.3s)]
*  That noticing that capacity to be honest about our own susceptibility is, I'm stretching it now, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2726.3s)]
*  a good thing, a healthy thing to have that perspective. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2737.3s)]
*  And so we might be enriched by that perspective. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2742.3s)]
*  We might become the stronger and the more socially responsible. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2748.3s)]
*  If we're aware, if we're just aware of our own vulnerabilities, I don't know, does that make any sense? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2754.3s)]
*  It does make sense. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2761.3s)]
*  This is related, I think, you pointed to a meanness in the world that feels ascendant at this moment. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2763.3s)]
*  And you suggested that the purveyors of that meanness, you know, they too were once vulnerable little children. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2772.3s)]
*  Well, still are. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2780.3s)]
*  Still are. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2781.3s)]
*  Whether they tell us or not. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2782.3s)]
*  And I'm just not sure what to do with that connection. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2783.3s)]
*  Like, so the awareness of those two things, the meanness in the world and that the people who are being mean [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2787.3s)]
*  still are vulnerable little children could elicit what productive response? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2794.3s)]
*  I suppose it's just about trying to not give up on connection, the possibility of connection between people. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2802.3s)]
*  And the thing that's so upsetting, deeply upsetting on a societal level and on a personal level about the predicament [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2811.3s)]
*  in which we find ourselves globally now, where there's this tendency in the far right to encourage us all to give up [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2819.3s)]
*  on human connection and entirely be self-serving and cynical about the notion of connection. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2828.3s)]
*  They would love us to give up. They would love us to give up on trying to reach some kind of agreement. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2837.3s)]
*  I mean, we just have to find agreements now. That's what we have to focus on. What can we agree on? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2845.3s)]
*  I can tell you, and he may even read this, but if I ever met your incoming president, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2852.3s)]
*  there is something I would really love to talk to him about, which is having a Scottish mother. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2859.3s)]
*  Having a mother from the Isle of Lewis. I know the Hebrides very well. That's something that I can go towards him on. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2865.3s)]
*  What would you want to talk to him about that? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2875.3s)]
*  I'd like, I want to hear. I want to hear about her. I'm very curious about her. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2877.3s)]
*  Extremely curious. I have to say, I think the odds of President Trump clicking on the Tilda Swinton interview are low, but you never know. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2884.3s)]
*  You do yourself down, David. I'm sure he's a fan of you. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2894.3s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? Who knows? You know, it has struck me in speaking with you that the way you talk about your development as an artist and even your life, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2898.3s)]
*  you just make it sound contingent. You know, you met these writers, you know, you wound up in Derek Jarman's orbit. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2909.3s)]
*  And of course, everyone's life is rooted in contingency, but there has to have been real intention in your life. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2917.3s)]
*  And I'm wondering, at the risk of sounding like a, you know, like I'm pumping you for self-help tips or something like that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2925.3s)]
*  What advice might you have for how to at least increase the possibility that someone might get the life they want? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2932.3s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you a little something and then we'll figure out why I want to tell you it because it might see if it means anything that might answer your question. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2940.3s)]
*  I do remember a moment in my very young life, which says a lot about the kind of milieu in which I grew up. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2948.3s)]
*  I remember when I was really young and my youngest brother was a baby in arms. So I can't have been older than five. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2956.3s)]
*  And I remember sitting up there one Sunday and looking down and seeing the people that I had been playing with the day before Saturday. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2965.3s)]
*  And I remember asking my mother, why were we sitting upstairs and we weren't sitting downstairs? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2975.3s)]
*  And I remember to this day, the look on her face, she could not come up with an answer. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2984.3s)]
*  And I noticed two things. First of all, that my brothers didn't ask this question. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2993.3s)]
*  I love them. They're sentient beings. And I love them. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=2999.3s)]
*  And I love them. And I love them. And I love them. And I love them. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3003.3s)]
*  My brothers didn't ask this question. I love them. They're sentient beings, but they did not ask that question. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3009.3s)]
*  I was the only one. And the other thing that I noticed since is that no one has ever come up with a good answer. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3015.3s)]
*  So the reason I tell you that story is the quest for connection was always there in me, is still there in me. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3022.3s)]
*  Connection is what I'm driven by. And I was lucky enough to notice it when I was sub six. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3032.3s)]
*  And so I'm quite a simple animal, I think. I think I can hold one idea. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3041.3s)]
*  So here's my answer to your question. Figuring out what your idea is, what your original setting, what your factory setting is, is probably a good place to start, to know oneself. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3047.3s)]
*  And to then when you do find your original setting, to honor it and try not to betray it and enjoy, enjoy the quest. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3059.3s)]

*  Occasionally I find a place that cannot handle the crowds and I will not write it up. You know, it's just too fragile. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3142.3s)]
*  Occasionally I find a place that doesn't want the crowds. That's pretty rare, to be honest. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3149.3s)]
*  And I don't write it up because I don't want to send people to a place where they're not welcome. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jURdx2pR70&t=3154.3s)]
