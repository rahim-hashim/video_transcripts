# Marlon Wayans Lost Nearly 60 Loved Ones. Comedy Saved Him.
**New York Times - The Interview:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not easy to make what some people might call dumb comedy. Because if it were, more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=9.88s)]
*  people would have a career as successful as Marlon Wayans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=15.16s)]
*  Wayans broke out in the early 2000s when he co-wrote and co-starred in slapstick comedy [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=19.0s)]
*  movie hits like Scary Movie 1 and 2, White Chicks, and My Personal Favorite, Little [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=24.34s)]
*  Man, which for those of you who don't remember is one in which he plays an adult masquerading [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=29.259999999999998s)]
*  as a baby. He spends most of the movie in a diaper. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=34.22s)]
*  Marlon is the youngest of 10 children and he's a member of the Wayans family comedy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=39.3s)]
*  dynasty which also includes his successful siblings Damon, Sean, Kim, and Keenan Ivory [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=42.66s)]
*  Wayans. They all had a hand in the groundbreaking 90s sketch comedy show In Living Color. Marlon [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  went from there to later starring on five seasons of the WB sitcom The Wayans Brothers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=52.98s)]
*  He made all those hit movies I mentioned. And then on top of all that, he's also built [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=57.62s)]
*  a nice career for himself as a supporting player in dramatic movies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=61.5s)]
*  But recently Wayans, who's now 51, has been using his comedy to work through some much [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=65.78s)]
*  heavier topics. His upcoming stand-up special called Good Grief is all about the death of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=70.1s)]
*  his parents as well as the nearly 60 other loved ones he's lost in just the last few [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=75.74s)]
*  years. When I talked to Marlon, he was in Albuquerque where he was filming a psychological [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=81.26s)]
*  horror movie with Jordan Peele's production company. And he was getting ready to host [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=85.58s)]
*  a party for the film's cast and crew where everyone was expected to show up in cowboy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  gear. Here's my conversation with Marlon Wayans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=94.5s)]
*  Hi Marlon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=98.5s)]
*  What's up David? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=103.06s)]
*  How are you? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  I'm good. Tired. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  Tired from filming? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah man, this one is a lot on the 50 year old body. 51. But it's great. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=109.14s)]
*  You said you're tired but you're having a party tonight? Is that what I just heard? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. When I do movies, I like to form community and family. And so I'm having a party for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=119.14s)]
*  my cast and my crew at my house that I'm renting. And it's just kind of a gathering. The fights [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=125.5s)]
*  are going to be on and just so people could mingle and roll some cigars and have some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  tacos. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=136.26s)]
*  Well, you know, since you're having a party tonight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=138.14s)]
*  Shindig. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=140.22s)]
*  A shindig. A knees up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=141.22s)]
*  You want to pull up? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=142.7s)]
*  It seems like a perfectly natural thing to talk about the subject of your new special, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=144.22s)]
*  which is the death of your parents. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=149.34s)]
*  Gang gang. Isn't that crazy? I, that, people are like, what's your next special? I'm like, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=151.34s)]
*  oh, it's a really funny, hilarious journey about the death of my parents. But I, what [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=158.82s)]
*  it wasn't just the death of my parents. I lost 57, 58 people that I loved in a matter [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=168.18s)]
*  of three years. And it felt like biblical. You know, you read things in the Bible and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=174.78s)]
*  you go, man, that's, that's some real traumatic stuff that person went through. And then they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=181.34s)]
*  find this light at the end, we get the lessons and it's always through like tragedy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=186.62s)]
*  How do you find the funny thing in the sad thing? Or when did you realize that you could [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  make comedy out of these traumatic events? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=198.34s)]
*  It's been a gift since I was a kid. I mean, all of us, Wayans, we're crazy people. Like, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  the worst thing happens. And the first thing we think is what's funny about it. There's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=209.42s)]
*  funny, absolutely everywhere. I remember my cousin said he died and my auntie buried him [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=213.54s)]
*  on jeans and he had a t-shirt and some Air Force 1s and a baseball cap. And me and Damon [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  sitting over his casket and Damon looks at me and goes, you know, if there's a dress [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=230.5s)]
*  code in heaven, I don't think city's getting in. And we, and people thought we were crying, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=236.84s)]
*  but we were crying laughing. We always look for laughs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=244.1s)]
*  Are there elements of the new special that you can point to and say, you know, this is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=251.18s)]
*  a kind of joke or the kind of material that I couldn't have done five years ago or 10 [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=256.98s)]
*  years ago? Like what in it is evidence of your growth as a comedian? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=262.74s)]
*  I think as a comedian, I'm getting to the good stuff. This was the hardest thing for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=268.66s)]
*  me to do to work on this material about my mom passing. And I'm still dealing with the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  grief as my dad is on his way to transitioning. I had two shows the night my father passed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=282.14s)]
*  I had two shows and I pulled up to the comedy club and I get a call and my dad died. I was [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=292.14s)]
*  like, okay. All right. Cried in the car real fast. Boom. I had a show. I didn't cancel [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  the show. I did my show and then right there in the stage, I told the audience my dad passed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=308.14s)]
*  and I broke down. I cried. And then I got ready for the next show. And I think in order [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=316.34s)]
*  to grow as a comedian, for me, it's like talking about the hard stuff. When you talk about [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  real life pain, like parents passing, something everybody may go through and you can get through [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=330.78s)]
*  that set and you can find these nuances of funny and you can still be irreverent, edgy, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=337.82s)]
*  crazy, silly, thought provoking and vulnerable all at the same time. I think that's growth. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=344.82s)]
*  And I miss my parents dearly, but I'm a different human with my parents gone than I was when [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=355.26s)]
*  they were here because I think now I'm a man. I don't have parents anymore. So I live differently [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=364.42s)]
*  and I understand the quality of life. I want to vacation more. I don't look at my phone [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=372.86s)]
*  as much. I walk. I never went outside and walked. I was never a walker. I thought people [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=378.62s)]
*  were crazy. Why are you walking? Like, bro, get on the trip. Every morning I get up and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=383.98s)]
*  for one half hour I go for a walk just to clear my mind, just to think. And it has me [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=389.54s)]
*  thinking in ways that I never thought before. I pray more because when I pray I feel like [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=395.82s)]
*  I'm speaking to my parents and that they're listening and I let them know what's going [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=401.70000000000005s)]
*  on. I report back to them like Mark when he used to talk to Ork. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=407.1s)]
*  Good reference. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=412.22s)]
*  Into the show. Very 1980s, 70s. But my identity has been concreted in the departure of my [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=413.22s)]
*  legendary parents. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=424.22s)]
*  So the key to self-improvement, it's simple. You just have to have your parents die. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=427.22s)]
*  That's a way. Sometimes they'll break you though. You know what's crazy? My mother's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=430.74s)]
*  death broke me. It shattered me into a million pieces because that was my girl. I never got [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=435.22s)]
*  married because I never wanted my mother to be jealous of a woman. I never wanted my mother [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  to feel second to any woman. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=446.62s)]
*  Is that true? You know that's the reason why you never got married? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=448.42s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. One of five reasons. I'll say that was like number two. Number one is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=450.86s)]
*  I was going to fuck that up. It's going to happen. Everybody that knows that I haven't [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  been married, they say all you did was skip two divorces. And my mom was very needy. And [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=463.7s)]
*  I told my mother on her deathbed, I said I never got married because I always wanted [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=470.22s)]
*  you to be my number one girl. Those were my last words. I said take that to heaven with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=475.02s)]
*  you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=479.38s)]
*  So I realize as we're talking about this, talking about your parents, not really making [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=481.14s)]
*  the case that this is a particularly funny special. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=486.78000000000003s)]
*  No, it's hilarious. Let me tell you, it's about an hour and seven minutes. It's hilarious [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=490.06s)]
*  for about an hour and five. And then you have spread throughout the special two to maybe [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=497.94s)]
*  three minutes of heart. I'm proud of this special because I think it's going to make [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=507.58s)]
*  you feel because I'm crazy and I know it and I could be inappropriate and I know it and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=513.32s)]
*  I'm always going to be obnoxious in that way. I think in order for me to hit the different [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=518.86s)]
*  levels of comedy, you got to be somewhat offensive. And I'm okay with that. But when you hit the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=523.94s)]
*  frequency, it speaks to heart and it's so relatable. You don't think that these things [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=530.58s)]
*  that you're going through, you think that it's just happening to you, but you do these [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=538.34s)]
*  sets and you're like, wow, this is happening to a lot of people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=542.46s)]
*  You said to reach certain levels of comedy, you got to be offensive. And there is the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=547.7s)]
*  material in the special. I'm thinking in particular of the Magic Johnson AIDS material. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=552.86s)]
*  Oh, you saw the special. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  I saw it. Yeah. Which by the way, he has HIV, not AIDS. You should go in and re-dub that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=559.5400000000001s)]
*  You know what the other mistake you make is? You call Louis Armstrong, sax player, trumpet [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=563.7s)]
*  player. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=568.6600000000001s)]
*  But it was still funny, right? Here's the thing. You can't be super on point with the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=569.6600000000001s)]
*  When you're telling jokes, sometimes you just tell the jokes, man. And it was crazy. It's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=574.8199999999999s)]
*  like I've had friends and relatives to die from AIDS. And so part of even that joke is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=579.38s)]
*  finding humor and things that happen. It's a different way to look at something tragic. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=587.38s)]
*  And I think the world has forgot how to laugh. And part of it is we're grooming people to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=594.14s)]
*  be sensitive. But I find when I'm in a comedy club, people like to laugh. They like to laugh [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=599.58s)]
*  at those dark things, the magic jokes. People want to laugh again. And I'm trying to deprogram [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=607.1800000000001s)]
*  and get us back to just laughing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=615.34s)]
*  So in the special, there's one magic joke I'm thinking about in particular, where I understand [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  what you're saying. You sort of have this series of jokes where you're framing it like [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=624.74s)]
*  magic's life got better after he got sick. That's kind of the hypothesis of the jokes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=629.9s)]
*  But then you throw in a line there about sex with monkeys or whatever. And that was the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=637.62s)]
*  one really where I cringe. I was like, oof, that's rough. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=642.9s)]
*  I said, show me the monkey I got next. I didn't say he had sex with monkeys. I said, I don't [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  know how he got this good version of this disease. But how ever he got that, I want [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=653.06s)]
*  it that way. To me, that was escapism. Because it's not real. Of course he didn't have sex [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=662.06s)]
*  with a monkey. If you read every joke, if you get literal, everybody's going to be offended [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=670.54s)]
*  by it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=676.54s)]
*  I'll play 72 things in that special to be offended by. I think great humor is take whoever [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=678.06s)]
*  you send up, those people are laughing the loudest. And I hope that magic laughs the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=686.3399999999999s)]
*  loudest at that joke. Which he will. Magic has a great sense of humor. I hope Shaq laughs [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=693.06s)]
*  at his joke. I hope all them laugh at- [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=699.06s)]
*  Do your Shaq impression right now. Do your Shaq impression. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=701.38s)]
*  Kobe. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=707.66s)]
*  These are friends of mine. When Kevin Hart does a LeBron hairline joke, I don't think [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=710.66s)]
*  LeBron gets mad. Part of it is, it's all out there. I'm not telling no secrets. This is [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=715.78s)]
*  all out there. I'm just going, here's a different way to look at it. I rescued myself from depression [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=722.78s)]
*  by learning to laugh in my worst circumstances. Losing my parents broke me. And I'm telling [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=731.42s)]
*  the audience, here's how you can survive this. Find humor in everything. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=740.98s)]
*  The idea of the culture getting too sensitive or overly sensitive, it's something that people [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=749.3s)]
*  have been talking about and have identified for a while now. And I'm just interested in [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=755.58s)]
*  digging into that a little bit more. Because on one hand, what we might say is too sensitive [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=762.2199999999999s)]
*  could also be understood as the culture being made safe for people who didn't feel safe [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=768.9799999999999s)]
*  in the culture before. The example that comes to mind for me is, it's one that has to do [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  with your life. You have a trans son, right? And so the sensitivity around how people talk [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=780.6999999999999s)]
*  about transgender people and what they say and how we think about transgender people, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=790.38s)]
*  that is directly related to a change in the culture that allows your son to live the life [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=794.88s)]
*  that he wants to live. Absolutely. These things are connected. So how do you see that connection? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=801.88s)]
*  On the one hand, what you're calling the sensitivity, on the other hand, how a culture actually [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=807.88s)]
*  changes. I'm working on a beautiful hour about that, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=812.88s)]
*  about the transition. And as a parent that went through it, I think I have something [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=819.0400000000001s)]
*  to say that forwards the agenda of that kind of unconditional love and acceptance for your [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=825.96s)]
*  child and for others. I went through it. And the transition wasn't about their transition. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=832.9200000000001s)]
*  It was my transition, going from like opposing what they wanted to do to complete acceptance. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=841.76s)]
*  And it was the five stages of grief. I felt like I was losing my daughter. My daughter [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=851.6s)]
*  was dying in my eyes. And so I speak about this from a true perspective. And I take you [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=856.64s)]
*  through the five stages of grief and midway through the act after denial, after anger. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  And when I get to bargaining, that's when the whole set flips. Because the people that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=872.64s)]
*  are angry and in denial, you know, they're all on my side as the parent at first. And [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=883.0s)]
*  I'm talking in complete ignorance, because that's what a lot of people are. And then [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  the whole set takes a complete 180. Because it's about me getting to acceptance. And I [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=897.08s)]
*  become a cautionary tale for the people that may be going through this, of how you can [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=905.0s)]
*  get through this. Try to get to acceptance as quickly as possible. It took me all of [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=912.44s)]
*  a week. That's all. It sounds like a busy week. It was. It was. Well, I was like, no, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=917.52s)]
*  you can't do this. You can't do that. I'm not supporting it. I was that guy. I was that [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=924.56s)]
*  guy. And I'm ashamed to say it. Because in my eyes, I was protecting my child. Now understanding [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=929.92s)]
*  that all I was doing was creating distance. And that's not fair to them. Who the f am [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=936.96s)]
*  I to stand in this person's way and tell them what's right for their life? I'm a parent. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=942.64s)]
*  And the only thing I can do as a parent is be an example to love my child and hope that other [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=948.64s)]
*  parents do the same. So did your experience with your son and understanding what your [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=956.32s)]
*  thought process was, the five stages, you know, and how you reacted to what pronouns does your [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=966.08s)]
*  son use? He and they. Right. So reacting to what they were going through. Did that change or [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=971.52s)]
*  affect your thinking at all about comedy and who gets made fun of when and how and when to push [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=978.56s)]
*  buttons? Yes and no. I think a comedian has the right to do have their point of view, just as [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=984.64s)]
*  people have their right to have their point of view. I don't get offended by anybody's humor. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=997.12s)]
*  I think, look, Don Rickles did a lot of racist jokes, but man, he was really funny. I'm part [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1005.6s)]
*  comedian, right? So before I'm even like black or a man, I'm a comedian. I'm all for comedians [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1013.28s)]
*  developing their point of view, no matter how ignorant, small, inconsiderate, dark, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1022.8s)]
*  they have to do this. Because if nobody tries to find the funny, then society's missing out on humor. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1031.6s)]
*  There are certain comedians, I'm thinking of, you know, Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, where it seems [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1041.76s)]
*  like to them, material about transgender people, it's the taboo that they need to keep pushing at [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1047.2s)]
*  to show that they're willing to push at a taboo. I don't think it's the taboo that they're pushing [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1054.4s)]
*  at. They just want to say what the hell they want to say. And who are you to tell me what I can say [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1059.92s)]
*  and not say? Dave is a friend of mine. I have a trans child. I'm not going to not be Dave's friend [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1065.44s)]
*  because of his point of view. I went to see his shows. We've had several conversations about [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  things. He knows I have a trans son, but that doesn't change the fact that, hey, you got to [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1077.04s)]
*  outwarn this that he wants to do from his point of view and he has every right to do it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1084.24s)]
*  Me and my child had this conversation and they understood, you know, they may feel that way. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1087.9199999999998s)]
*  But I said, as a comedian, he has every right to say what he wants to say [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1094.0s)]
*  and try to find the humor in what he's saying. I don't think his intention is to make you feel bad. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1101.52s)]
*  I think he's just trying to protect his right to say what he feels. We don't have to think [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1108.64s)]
*  alike. You're still my friend. I learned from you. There's things I learned from you. And [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1115.68s)]
*  hopefully through conversations, we could come to the fence and agree on and disagree on some [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1121.28s)]
*  things, but we affect change in each other. And that's life. And I think we have to learn [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1126.3999999999999s)]
*  to laugh again. We're heading to a very sad place when we can't laugh anymore. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1135.04s)]
*  But you know, I really think the idea that we don't laugh anymore is just fundamentally wrong. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1142.48s)]
*  If you take social media as an example, it would be just joke after joke after joke, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  funny meme after funny meme. To me, the question is really what are those jokes saying? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1153.6799999999998s)]
*  Who's telling the joke? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1160.0s)]
*  Who's telling the joke and what are they trying to convey with the joke? I think that feels to me [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1161.12s)]
*  like the more germane question. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1166.32s)]
*  People don't tell the same jokes they used to at work. There's no water cooler talk anymore. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1169.52s)]
*  What's the last time you were at a water cooler? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1174.72s)]
*  I got one in my house. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1178.32s)]
*  Was your assistant laughing at your jokes? Oh, good for you. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1181.52s)]
*  No, but I think even now when you walk on sets, it's like everybody's tight. Nobody wants to offend. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1184.96s)]
*  Nobody wants to say anything. We're a bunch of robots just walking around. There's no joy. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  That's why I love performing on a stage because it's a reminder to me that people still want to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1198.24s)]
*  laugh. There's nothing like that elation that you get. It's a high that you get when you don't know [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1202.96s)]
*  if this joke that I'm about to say is going to offend everybody or they're going to walk out [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1209.28s)]
*  or they're going to boo me or they're going to hate this. And then you tell it and everybody [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  cracks up and you're like, whew. It's just when you get into the corporate setting or you go, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1218.32s)]
*  sometimes when you go home, it's safety again. But now, even then, you can't say that. You can't say [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1224.72s)]
*  your kid's telling you, dad, that's inappropriate. That's inappropriate to you, you little fucker. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1232.96s)]
*  To me, it's perfect. I pay the rent here. I'm going to say what I want. It's okay for me to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  be inappropriate. My inappropriateness has paid for your college. You talked earlier about changes [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1242.56s)]
*  in what's considered funny or what we expect of comedians. And I was thinking about that in the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1254.56s)]
*  context of your hit movies, which come out of the tradition of Mel Brooks films or Zuckar, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1260.24s)]
*  Abram Zuckar films. Those were hits. Those were moneymakers. You made them cheap and you made a [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1267.52s)]
*  lot of money on them. But those kinds of films are also really not in vogue anymore. And it seems to [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1272.72s)]
*  be like both in standup and in just in film comedy, generally, there's always the idea that the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1279.2s)]
*  comedy has to be kind of like about something in addition to being funny. Like it can't just be a [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1284.48s)]
*  funny movie. It also has to be about a larger theme. And I'm curious to know why you think [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1291.2s)]
*  the kind of comedies that you made your name with fell out of vogue. What's changed? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1300.4s)]
*  Well, if you look at Hollywood for the past 10 years, there hasn't been a lot of comedies, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1307.04s)]
*  period. Because Hollywood, everything is cyclical. They were chasing the superhero. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1313.2s)]
*  They were chasing the blockbuster. And I'm very patient because they're gonna make comedies again. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  But I think the people that's gonna make the comedies are the people that know how to make [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1327.2s)]
*  the comedies. They keep trying to make like these like scary movies. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1333.28s)]
*  The audience is like, that don't taste like the Wayans. I'm not going. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1342.72s)]
*  Because they know we know how to tell these jokes. There's a family recipe that we've had. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1348.08s)]
*  You can't replicate what we do. It's just we know you can have all the seasonings. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1355.12s)]
*  You don't know how much to put on it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1360.16s)]
*  Is the new scary movie that they just announced that irritating to you? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1364.48s)]
*  No. I mean, it's not the first time we've heard it. So if they want to waste $50 million, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1369.1200000000001s)]
*  go for it. Do you get a check from that? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1382.64s)]
*  No, that's a whole nother conversation. I like to say that, you know, those Weinsteins, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1385.92s)]
*  they wasn't just they they they raped everybody. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1397.2s)]
*  Not the same business wise, not the same business wise, literally and business wise. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1406.56s)]
*  They they we all got a little bit of a little taste. They there were some terrible, terrible [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  people. Good example of an offensive joke. Depends on the audience. Damn, Dave, you sensitive. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1417.52s)]
*  I'm gonna take you to a Ricky Gervais show and a Dave Chappelle show. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1427.76s)]
*  And watch what you go. Oh, God. Wait, do me being sensitive in a white guy voice. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1433.44s)]
*  Oh, God, you can't say that. Christ. Jesus. Hey, Christ. That's inappropriate. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1440.24s)]
*  You know, it's crazy. What's crazy, Marlon? Like, no, I think like, even when you go on stage, right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1454.56s)]
*  And you say a certain topic. Immediately, sometimes you feel audience tighten up. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1462.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then your job as a comedian is. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1470.56s)]
*  To basically beat them into submission. Until they either lighten up or they tighten up so much [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1476.32s)]
*  that you leave, they tight ass was right there and you say good night. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1485.28s)]
*  Just before we go, you know, I know you got to get ready for a party. Can you tell me a funny [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1491.04s)]
*  party story from your life? A funny party story? Yeah, party story. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1497.04s)]
*  I feel like you've been to a few parties. I've been to too many parties. Oh, man. Oh, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1503.44s)]
*  oh, I saw Tupac 20 minutes before he got shot. And ironically, I saw Biggie 20 minutes before [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1510.48s)]
*  he got shot. I mean, it's not funny, but wow, what a coincidence. Wait, is that true? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1515.6s)]
*  In both instances? Yeah. Holy moly. That's not funny. 20 minutes from now, you make his shot. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing. And then you laugh. He's a sick man. David. Oh, wait, can I try an offensive joke [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1526.64s)]
*  on you? Go for it. So you had 58. I just thought of this one. Go for it. You had 58 loved ones. Yes. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1533.44s)]
*  Diarrhea. You ever think the problem is you? Are you contagious? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1541.92s)]
*  They want to get the hell away from me. 58 people? Or wait, I can keep going. 60 if you include [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1548.3200000000002s)]
*  Tupac and Biggie. There you go. Are you counting anyone that you just admire as a loved one? Like [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1554.4s)]
*  you see, oh, Tina Turner died. Oh, she's just number 55. No, she wasn't one of the people. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1559.76s)]
*  Some of those people were like Chadwick was a friend. That was the hard one. Yeah. You know, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1566.88s)]
*  I swear, like it's crazy. Like when you think about how many people have passed this, and that's what [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1573.2s)]
*  made me do the special because I feel like we need to laugh about it. I needed therapy. It was [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1580.16s)]
*  therapy for me. I still hurt. But man, the last time I cried about my mom and my dad [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1586.64s)]
*  was only on set recently. And that's because my director, he's a sick man, and he wanted to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1594.72s)]
*  to incite some feelings. And he said, just think about how proud your mom and dad are of you [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1602.56s)]
*  right now. And I thought about, I thought about how I showed up in their absence from my family [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1612.8s)]
*  and how I was able to help bury them, help my older siblings get through, help my nephews and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1624.32s)]
*  my nieces just show up for everybody. Yeah. And I think that's what they raised me to be. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1631.36s)]
*  And that's what they'd be proud of. Well, I appreciate you showing that emotion. Now I can see [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1639.28s)]
*  tears in your eyes. And you know, I'm sorry that you're going through that, but it's really good [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1646.8799999999999s)]
*  for me for this podcast. If you cry maybe a little bit more audibly, I'd really appreciate that. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1652.7199999999998s)]
*  I like you. You're going to be my friend, Dave. You're going to be my friend. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1662.0s)]
*  But you know, thank you. Thank you for that openness. I appreciate it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  You just want to leave on a high note. But that was a joyful cry. I do miss them, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1671.04s)]
*  but I know they would be proud. But Marlon, I'll talk to you later this week. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1676.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1681.4399999999998s)]
*  After the break, I call Marlon back to revisit that Weinstein joke [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1681.92s)]
*  and talk a little bit more about parenthood. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1690.96s)]
*  I can't say what I am as a father. They can say what I am as a father. And when I'm gone, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1693.44s)]
*  I hope I left them with a whole lot of love and a whole lot of memories. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  What if flaws, whatever, I wasn't able to show up. I hope they forget that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1703.28s)]
*  Hi, Marlon. How are you? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1711.92s)]
*  I'm good, man. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1729.04s)]
*  So, you know, I was thinking about a very specific moment from our conversation where [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1732.4s)]
*  I asked you about no longer being involved with the scary movie franchise. And you mentioned [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1739.84s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein, who, you know, I guess you believe kind of strong armed you out of the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1745.52s)]
*  series. And when you brought it up, actually, it was Bob and Harvey. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1750.1599999999999s)]
*  But it was clear you were loading up a joke. And you had this pause where I think you were [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1755.04s)]
*  thinking about then whether to say the joke. And I want to know if you can tell me like in your head [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1761.36s)]
*  in that moment when you have the like the potentially offensive joke lined up, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1767.84s)]
*  what is actually going through your head in that pause? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  Who's my audience? And I heard you cringe on the other thing, the monkey joke. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1778.32s)]
*  But I was going to say, you know, he didn't just, you know, he does this with women, he [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1786.48s)]
*  raves too. Trust me, we did business with them. Yeah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  You see your response? Do you see your response? I call that we call that and like me and my brother [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1798.24s)]
*  meets me in a writer's room. Oh, we did network notes. And, you know, we've always been edgy with [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1805.04s)]
*  our humor. Always. That's just how we do it. Right. And so when people have that reaction, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1810.4s)]
*  like, oh, God, you know, little things you do. We call that we used to call it getting on a [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1816.48s)]
*  whitey bike. It was like brothers would crack up at that. But white people like, oh, I don't know [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1822.4s)]
*  about that. And they start peddling backwards. You know, it's funny, though. I'm not I don't [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1828.4s)]
*  know if the whitey bike is actually the bike I ride on because it's the bike that you said it [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1833.44s)]
*  made me laugh. I'm not offended, you know, but there is the thing where it's like when somebody [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1840.88s)]
*  says the taboo thing where you go like, I don't know, are you allowed to say that? But that's [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1847.3600000000001s)]
*  different than taking offense. You know what I mean? But what is taboo when you've been in [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1851.84s)]
*  a situation for me? Right. Once again, I can talk about things from a different perspective. And when [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1855.6799999999998s)]
*  I talk about Bob and Harvey and I say that it's because there's damage there, I can go into [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1860.9599999999998s)]
*  a whole nother article about the scary movie franchise. And you guys are like, oh, I see why [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1868.8s)]
*  he said what he said, because we have been victims in that way, but in business, not physically, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1874.56s)]
*  but in business. And, you know, I think a monster is a monster. And those monsters showed up in [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1882.08s)]
*  business as well. Yeah. You know, in the Good Grief special, you talked about how you learned [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1888.0s)]
*  to be a man from your dad. But I'm curious about what you learned about manhood and masculinity from [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1895.52s)]
*  your son. That sometimes you have to work your femininity. It's okay to be [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1903.36s)]
*  in touch with your feminine. It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to express yourself. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1910.9599999999998s)]
*  It's okay to unstrap from your masculinity and your ego. And sometimes that takes you not to, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1915.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, to have a different approach. And sometimes it's not about trying to teach them, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1922.8s)]
*  maybe God's trying to teach you something. And so it taught me to be a lot more accepting [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1927.6s)]
*  and unconditional and even forgiving of myself. It's okay to have stupid thoughts. It's okay to [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  forgive yourself for having a point of view that's not completely popular or evolved. It's okay to [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1942.56s)]
*  have those small feelings, those insecure things, those egotistical thoughts. That's like, nah, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1949.36s)]
*  I think I can control everything. And then God breaks you down and life breaks you down. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1956.8s)]
*  And when you realize that you are, you're crumbled and you're on your knees, that's when God can just [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1961.9199999999998s)]
*  whisper to you. And you're like, oh, that's what you're trying to teach me. And I'm very grateful [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1967.6s)]
*  to my child. I love that baby because that's my firstborn. And I can't say what I am as a father. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1973.52s)]
*  They can say what I am as a father. And when I'm gone, I hope I left them with a whole lot of love [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1981.68s)]
*  and a whole lot of memories. Whatever flaws, whatever I wasn't able to show up, I hope they [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1987.44s)]
*  forgive that. You've referred a couple of times to hearing God or God talking to you. And do you [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=1993.3600000000001s)]
*  remember the last thing God said to you or the last thing that you remember feeling like it was [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=2001.44s)]
*  coming from God? For me, my God speaks to me every day. He's in everything I do, even in my jokes, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=2007.04s)]
*  even in my experience, even in the darkness. God gave me a gift, which is to stay joyful through [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=2013.44s)]
*  dark things. He gave me a gift and I'm going to give that gift as much as I can, as long as I can. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=2020.64s)]
*  And that will be my life identity is that in the worst moments, I was able to try and find a smile [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=2026.96s)]
*  and hold my hand up through the rubble and go, Hey guys, take this one with you. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krM21IHmjq4&t=2032.88s)]
