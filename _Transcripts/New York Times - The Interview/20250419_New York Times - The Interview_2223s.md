# Nate Bargatze Doesn't Mind if You Think He’s an Idiot
**New York Times - The Interview:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E)
*  I have a lot of grandmothers come to my shows, and they love me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=0.0s)]
*  I do really good with grandmothers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=4.3s)]
*  I don't think there's much being made that they could go to. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  Certainly not stand-up comedy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=11.34s)]
*  That's the goal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=13.22s)]
*  I'm trying to be only grandmothers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=14.52s)]
*  Shows are at 8.30 a.m. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=16.14s)]
*  That's the late show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=18.12s)]
*  Usually, when a stand-up comedian catches fire, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=21.18s)]
*  it's because they're seen as dangerous. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=24.26s)]
*  They're saying the things others don't have the nerve to say [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=26.26s)]
*  about subjects others don't want to talk about [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=28.82s)]
*  in language others would never use. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=30.92s)]
*  I'm thinking of stars like Richard Pryor. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=32.84s)]
*  You know, because you live around white people in the country, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=35.44s)]
*  anything can happen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=37.6s)]
*  Not that I don't trust white people, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=38.9s)]
*  it's just that in the night, you know what I mean? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=40.34s)]
*  Amy Schumer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  I can't believe I have the honor of being the final host [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=43.74s)]
*  before the midterm abortions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Elections! [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  Dave Chappelle. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=50.14s)]
*  I respect everybody's beliefs, except Amish people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=50.94s)]
*  Nate Bargetzi has risen to superstar status [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=55.38s)]
*  by doing something completely different. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  When I started comedy, some comics would be like, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=60.42s)]
*  well, I'm not for everybody. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=62.02s)]
*  And I was like, well, why would you not want to be [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=63.18s)]
*  for everybody? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  He's low-key and clean, and his comedy traffics [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  in highly relatable stories about the foibles [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=68.2s)]
*  of family life, his confusion with modern living, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  and his own lack of smarts. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=73.4s)]
*  I looked up the most popular books. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=74.64s)]
*  It was like Christina Agatha. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  Is that her name? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=78.5s)]
*  It's like an author. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=79.5s)]
*  Agatha Christie. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Agatha Christie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=83.84s)]
*  So I was backwards. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=84.68s)]
*  Wait, that wasn't just a bit Christina Agatha? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=86.26s)]
*  No, I thought that's what it was. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=88.54s)]
*  It's an approach that's working. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=90.34s)]
*  He had the highest grossing comedy tour of 2024. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  He's also found a new audience [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=94.98s)]
*  by hosting Saturday Night Live. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=96.48s)]
*  Look, if you're at home, I'm as shocked as you are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  that I'm here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=100.28s)]
*  And now he's branching out to a new area [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=101.12s)]
*  with his upcoming book titled Big Dumb Eyes, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  Stories from a Simpler Mind. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=105.48s)]
*  That kind of self-deprecation is a trademark of his. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=107.76s)]
*  High school, I got pushed into a wall head first, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=110.26s)]
*  and it took them three class periods [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  to figure out how to have a concussion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  That's how much I was bringing to the table. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  But as I learned, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=119.1s)]
*  it's actually masking some surprisingly bold ambition. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=120.5s)]
*  I'm David Marchese, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=123.5s)]
*  and here's my interview with Nate Bargetzi. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=124.69999999999999s)]
*  You know, and it's interesting reading articles about you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=130.9s)]
*  over the last couple of years [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=135.28s)]
*  since your career has really sort of taken off [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=136.62s)]
*  and you hit a new level. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=139.92s)]
*  And the writers of those articles [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=142.26s)]
*  are always trying to explain why you've gotten so big. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=144.28s)]
*  But what's your hunch about why you have gotten [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  to the place you've gotten to over the last couple of years? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=152.56s)]
*  Like, why you? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  Why you? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=156.76s)]
*  There's lots of comedians. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=157.6s)]
*  Why you? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=158.42s)]
*  I always wonder why you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=159.26s)]
*  You know, I mean, I think as you're talking [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=160.56s)]
*  about relatable things and you're talking about, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  I think authenticity, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=163.2s)]
*  not that I'm going out for authenticity, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=164.84s)]
*  but you're in a world now where entertainment is, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  I think, there is no authenticity. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=170.6s)]
*  You have the Wicked and you have these Avenger movies [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=174.46s)]
*  and you have all this stuff that's great, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=178.9s)]
*  but there's not like a regular person [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  like on a screen anymore. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=182.56s)]
*  And where the movies used to kind of be like that, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=183.9s)]
*  where you would see Planes, Trains, and Automobiles [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  and Home Alone and some of these aspects [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  where you would have someone be like, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  all right, that's a guy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=192.94s)]
*  That's a regular guy in this movie that you enjoy watching. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like easier to watch [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=197.78s)]
*  and it's just easier to take in. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=199.32s)]
*  You just want to be entertained [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  and you don't always want to be thought provoked. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=204.08s)]
*  And that's something that I've always tried to stay clear of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=207.62s)]
*  is because I realized like, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=213.02s)]
*  I need people to be able to trust that they can come, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  if they come listen to what I'm gonna say [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=218.22000000000003s)]
*  or come buy it, I'm a product. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=220.4s)]
*  I'm what I'm trying to sell you something. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=222.5s)]
*  I'm selling you entertainment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=224.94000000000003s)]
*  So I need you to be able to come and trust [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  that you're gonna get the entertainment [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  and showing you that I'm selling you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=229.66s)]
*  You said, you know, I'm selling something, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=233.42s)]
*  which is an interesting thing to hear [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  because obviously that's true [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=237.94s)]
*  and obviously that's true for just about everyone [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  in the entertainment business. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  But usually, in my experience, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  people aren't so explicit in saying that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  Why do you think there is hesitation on the part [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=249.38s)]
*  of some entertainers to say like, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=252.06s)]
*  hey, I'm selling something? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=253.42s)]
*  I don't know, because I think there's got this weird, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=256.7s)]
*  I mean, it's just, I think kind of in life in general, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=260.3s)]
*  it's got this self-importance that it's, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=261.46s)]
*  I have a platform, so I need to say something [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=265.14s)]
*  on this platform and I'm kind of anti-platform. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=269.74s)]
*  It's not, I don't need to use this platform [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  to tell you what to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=275.9s)]
*  You know, if I go want to give you my opinion [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  and like tell you how what I think and all this, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=281.14s)]
*  I also think that's a lot about me is what I think. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  And so it's like, this can't be about me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=286.7s)]
*  When I go on stage, I try to remind myself, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=288.68s)]
*  this night's not about me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  It has nothing to do with me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=292.36s)]
*  If it becomes about me, it's too much, I can't handle it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=293.48s)]
*  But if I can make it for other people, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  now I'm just kind of an employee and I'm working. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  And so I'm just making stuff for people. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=300.68s)]
*  And so it's like, it's not about my self-importance [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=303.12s)]
*  or any of that stuff. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=305.92s)]
*  It just doesn't matter. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  You don't need me to do that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=307.88s)]
*  Help me understand the distinction you're making [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  when you say, you know, I don't want it to be all about me [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=311.36s)]
*  because your material, it is largely about you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=314.56s)]
*  Well, it's about me and the fact that, yes, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=318.78s)]
*  I'm talking about myself and I'm making fun of myself, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=321.46s)]
*  but the material's written for you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=324.58s)]
*  I mean, I just got a message today about a lady [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=327.34s)]
*  that's like, she doesn't like flying. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=329.5s)]
*  And I get like messages like this all the time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=333.3s)]
*  And so she's like, I listened to you [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=335.02s)]
*  and you've helped me get fly because it's like, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=337.26s)]
*  just, I don't know, it's like takes her mind off of it [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=339.78s)]
*  or whatever, it's the way you watch a show [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  that's comforting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=343.7s)]
*  So anytime I think I want to go do something else, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=344.74s)]
*  it's like I think about the her and go, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=347.74s)]
*  well, that's not fair to her. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=349.76s)]
*  I'm not doing it to make myself look good or look better [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=352.12s)]
*  or do this kind of stuff. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=356.32s)]
*  I'm doing it to make you laugh. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=357.2s)]
*  I always say you can laugh with me or at me. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=359.0s)]
*  So it doesn't matter. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=361.52s)]
*  Like you can, you relate to it or you think I'm an idiot. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=362.48s)]
*  Either way, it's like, I'm here to entertain you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=365.76s)]
*  And when you were starting out, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=368.44s)]
*  did you feel like any sort of peer pressure [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=370.76s)]
*  from other comedians to perform differently [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=374.44s)]
*  or tell different kinds of jokes? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=378.14s)]
*  Because you work clean, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=379.26s)]
*  your stuff isn't really political in nature at all. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=382.78s)]
*  There's a lot of family jokes, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  which I could imagine if you're a 28 year old guy [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=388.5s)]
*  working comedy clubs in New York City, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=391.54s)]
*  there's maybe not a ton of your peers [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=393.58s)]
*  are doing that kind of material. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=394.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was, I mean, the idea of it, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=396.3s)]
*  I would do a lot of shows that would be on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=399.74s)]
*  when you're starting out, it'd be midnight, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=402.3s)]
*  it'd be a show called Uncensored Comedy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=403.94s)]
*  And I mean, these are, some of my friends are like, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=407.0s)]
*  very dirty, yeah, most of the comics I'm around [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=409.4s)]
*  were the complete opposite of everything that I did. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=411.76s)]
*  I had to learn how to do what I was doing in those rooms, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=415.52s)]
*  but I didn't want you to notice that I was clean. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=418.6s)]
*  So I think that is something that helped me [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=421.26s)]
*  into the fact that if I can go up and make you laugh [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=423.2s)]
*  and make these, this crowd laugh, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=426.6s)]
*  I'm 28 years old in New York City doing a show, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=429.36s)]
*  it's one in the morning, these people are drunk [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  and then I'm doing it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=434.16s)]
*  How can I do this material that's not doing sexual jokes [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=435.18s)]
*  or whatever everybody else was kind of doing? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=441.5s)]
*  And so you learn how to try to hide it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=444.94s)]
*  Because I think if you walked up and said I'm clean, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  it's gonna be like, well, this guy's not cool [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  and this guy's not this and that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=452.74s)]
*  But I think it, I look back at now, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=454.82000000000005s)]
*  it was like I was reliable for late night sets [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=457.06s)]
*  because I was clean, foul and light me, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=460.86s)]
*  and so it was like an easy one to go do and rely on [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  because you know I'm not gonna say, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=468.48s)]
*  I'm not having to change my act for television. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=470.32s)]
*  Your family is the source of a lot of your material? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=474.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=478.66s)]
*  And your wife in particular? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=479.5s)]
*  And I did wonder, does she have to vet the jokes [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=481.36s)]
*  that you tell about her? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=484.8s)]
*  Like if you're coming up with a joke [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=485.64s)]
*  based on something she's done that annoys you say [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=487.12s)]
*  or that you found strange, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=490.24s)]
*  do you then go to her and say like, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=492.04s)]
*  hey, I'm working on this joke, are you okay with that? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell her, yes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=496.14s)]
*  I mean there's a couple times I'll go try it first [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=498.3s)]
*  to make sure I even want to. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=500.86s)]
*  Like if it even, because if it's not gonna work [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=503.26s)]
*  then maybe there is no reason for me to bring it up to her. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  I know, but then if it works you're even in more of a bind. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=507.42s)]
*  But if it works then I go [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=510.44s)]
*  and I can figure out how to say it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=512.06s)]
*  And I always try to make fun of myself too in it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=514.08s)]
*  When I first started I would do jokes about my wife [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=516.78s)]
*  and I could tell that the audience, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=518.78s)]
*  if they don't know you and if you don't show love [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=521.24s)]
*  then they're not gonna go with you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=523.72s)]
*  So if you show that aspect of it [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=524.96s)]
*  then you can get away with quite a bit. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=527.2s)]
*  With my daughter I'm very sensitive. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  I haven't talked to her about her a ton [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=531.84s)]
*  outside when she was a baby [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=534.48s)]
*  because I didn't want her to be her own person. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=535.76s)]
*  I want her a bit of a trust [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  that she can come to me as her father [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=540.0s)]
*  which is the most important thing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  and say stuff to me and not think anything she says [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=543.64s)]
*  I'm gonna go tell the whole world. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=546.64s)]
*  So it's splitting that balance to be like [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=549.18s)]
*  I wanna be very protective of that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=552.12s)]
*  for my wife, for my family, for any of them [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=554.12s)]
*  to know that I'm not just using all of them [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=556.8s)]
*  to gather material. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=560.12s)]
*  Your dad was a comedian and a clown [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  when you were growing up. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=571.8s)]
*  Do you and he have any competitive feelings about comedy? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  He did, so he was a clown at the beginning [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  and then he did magic. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=580.52s)]
*  He's a magician. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=582.28s)]
*  I mean he'll tell me jokes and stuff [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  and say well you didn't say this and say that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=585.88s)]
*  so I can talk to him about comedy and all this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=587.7199999999999s)]
*  But yeah, he comes out on the road with me [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=590.68s)]
*  and he's done a hundred and something shows with me [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=593.7199999999999s)]
*  in arenas and all this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=596.2399999999999s)]
*  So I would say competitive. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=598.2399999999999s)]
*  I mean we lived, it's like different. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=600.68s)]
*  I mean when he came up, they had three kids [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=603.38s)]
*  and he had a day job and he did all this stuff. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=606.2s)]
*  He could have moved to Vegas when we were younger [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=609.62s)]
*  and he chose not to. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  So we grew up in Nashville and I think grew up [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=614.5400000000001s)]
*  with a very normal, I mean as normal as you can [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=617.22s)]
*  with your dad being a magician. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I think he's very proud [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=621.74s)]
*  and he cries when he brings me on stage. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=625.1400000000001s)]
*  You know I ask just because I don't think it's uncommon [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=629.82s)]
*  for when fathers and sons kinda go into the same [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=632.26s)]
*  or related lines of work for that to sometimes [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=634.72s)]
*  be emotionally complicated. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=637.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=640.24s)]
*  I'm sure there is some competitive to us. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=642.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean there's some where you go travel, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  like I love traveling with my dad [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=646.44s)]
*  and then there's times where you're like, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  I always joke to be like, it's every little boy's dream [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=650.88s)]
*  to travel with your dad when you're 45 years old. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=653.32s)]
*  So you know, got a tour bus with a CPAP machine. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  It go really livin' it up. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=660.08s)]
*  You know, your dad grew up in pretty different circumstances [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=665.6s)]
*  than you grew up in. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, it sorta had a hard childhood. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  And then your daughter is then growing up [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  in different circumstances than you grew up in. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  She's just a lot, I assume a lot more affluent. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=681.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you think about how your daughter understands [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=685.2s)]
*  how or why her life and her childhood [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=689.6400000000001s)]
*  are so different than yours or her grandfather's? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=693.9s)]
*  I don't know if she gets it to the extent of that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=698.26s)]
*  I think we've done a pretty good job. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=703.82s)]
*  We moved back to Nashville. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=707.06s)]
*  We live in a cul-de-sac. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=708.36s)]
*  We're not around a lot of, you know, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=709.46s)]
*  like a big crazy neighborhood where it's, you know, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=713.54s)]
*  just everybody's famous or wealthy or whatever. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=718.0s)]
*  But yeah, she, I mean, she has stuff, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  the amount of stuff I wasn't allowed to have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=724.68s)]
*  versus what she has is, it's not even remotely close. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=726.3599999999999s)]
*  I wanted Jordan shoes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=731.16s)]
*  But we got some from Dollar General [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  and they just kinda look like Jordan shoes. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=736.4799999999999s)]
*  I would get all this stuff, the Super Bowl team that lost, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=739.3399999999999s)]
*  I'd be wearing all that stuff. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=742.4799999999999s)]
*  Right, a lot of Buffalo Bills gear. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=744.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, according to my family, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=747.06s)]
*  the Bills have won four in a row. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=749.4799999999999s)]
*  You have been doing this a long time, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=751.6600000000001s)]
*  but it's probably in the last, what, six or seven years [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=754.86s)]
*  where you sort of changed actually how you look. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=759.0600000000001s)]
*  You got a different haircut. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=762.4200000000001s)]
*  You grew the beard and mustache, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=764.0400000000001s)]
*  started dressing a little cooler. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=766.74s)]
*  I think maybe you lost some weight. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=768.86s)]
*  Did the impetus to do that come from you [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=770.6600000000001s)]
*  or did a manager or agent say like, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=774.38s)]
*  hey, if you wanna get to the next level, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=776.46s)]
*  we might wanna think about making some changes? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=779.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Kid Show Business showed up and goes, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=782.24s)]
*  hey, Fatso, if you wanna make it, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=785.0s)]
*  you better get your life together. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=788.68s)]
*  No, I mean, it's both. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=793.9599999999999s)]
*  It's a mix of, no one told me to do anything. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=796.04s)]
*  I mean, as a comic, weirdly enough, you're you [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=798.76s)]
*  and you're talking about yourself, so you are gonna be you. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=801.76s)]
*  But I wanted to do it too and I'm going through it right now. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=804.8399999999999s)]
*  I do not have great eating habits. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=810.1s)]
*  And when I grew up, we just ate because you had to eat. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=812.66s)]
*  It wasn't food was never celebrated [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=816.14s)]
*  or food was just something you had to do. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=819.3s)]
*  And so I eat a lot of fast food and a lot of chain food [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=822.14s)]
*  and I get in on the road. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=825.8199999999999s)]
*  And I do realize it can get in the way though. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=827.3399999999999s)]
*  I realized it, I stopped drinking in like 2018 [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  because I knew if I wanted to get [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=833.8199999999999s)]
*  where I wanted to get as a comic, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=835.5799999999999s)]
*  this was gonna be in the way. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=838.46s)]
*  And so I've realized that with food too, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=839.86s)]
*  if I wanna do this thing, I wanna do stand up [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=842.54s)]
*  at this high level, possibly make some movies, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=845.82s)]
*  all this kind of stuff, even for myself, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=849.1s)]
*  I realize, all right, well, I have to go put in the effort [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=850.82s)]
*  for me to be able to handle all this kind of touring [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=855.62s)]
*  and in the mentality it takes to stay focused. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=859.78s)]
*  Which is interesting to hear you say that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=864.26s)]
*  because you don't think of the image that pops [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=865.62s)]
*  into the mind when one thinks of a comedian [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=868.74s)]
*  is not like a super fit guy. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=870.34s)]
*  I always say, I'm looking forward to the day [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=873.22s)]
*  you can't see my nipples through my shirt. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=875.82s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=878.0400000000001s)]
*  That's all we're working towards. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=879.5s)]
*  One day we're gonna get there. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=880.7s)]
*  And I know you're working on a new hour of material. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=882.78s)]
*  Can you share maybe a joke or a section of it [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=888.22s)]
*  that you're feeling good about? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=892.5400000000001s)]
*  The thing about nothing to do, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=894.48s)]
*  that's one that I'm working on [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=895.64s)]
*  because there's nothing to do. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=897.0s)]
*  So the joke I do is bowling's still around [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=901.96s)]
*  because that's how, if you and your wife [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=904.6800000000001s)]
*  and your family is like, let's go do something, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=907.84s)]
*  you go out to eat and go see a movie [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=909.4000000000001s)]
*  and you get to bowling a lot quicker than you, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=911.64s)]
*  you probably should be. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  It's 2025, so we have AI. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=916.0400000000001s)]
*  I feel like bowling is a caveman sport [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=919.72s)]
*  that should have faded out. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=922.5400000000001s)]
*  But that's how little there is to do, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=925.02s)]
*  that it's still hanging around. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=927.02s)]
*  We're obviously talking ahead of the publication [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=929.02s)]
*  of your book, Big Dumb Eyes. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=932.3s)]
*  And you joke in the book about not being much of a reader. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=934.66s)]
*  The way you've put it is, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=940.02s)]
*  books just have too many words. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=942.02s)]
*  And to help readers, you threw in some blank pages [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  in your own book to help, I think the way you put it is, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=946.66s)]
*  help readers keep their head above water. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=949.46s)]
*  Get your head above water. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=954.94s)]
*  But now that you've written a book, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=955.94s)]
*  are you feeling any differently about books? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=958.3s)]
*  I did think, I thought of it last night [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=961.78s)]
*  as I was watching something. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=964.1800000000001s)]
*  Like on TV, I'm like, I was like, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=968.1s)]
*  I think this is when you should be reading. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=969.74s)]
*  Like before bed. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=972.24s)]
*  You know, I was like, I think that's when people do it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=974.46s)]
*  That's why there's reading lamps and reading lights [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=976.7s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=979.0600000000001s)]
*  But I was thinking about getting just a fun book. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=981.28s)]
*  You know, like what's an easy one. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=984.28s)]
*  So it's like, let's start with something super fun [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=985.76s)]
*  and then just get into a habit. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=989.4s)]
*  Do you have a sense of what that book would be? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=993.24s)]
*  I looked up like the most popular books. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  It was like Christina Agatha. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=998.9599999999999s)]
*  Is that her name? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1001.64s)]
*  It's like an author. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1002.68s)]
*  Agatha Christie. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1003.5999999999999s)]
*  Agatha Christie. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1007.04s)]
*  So I was backwards. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1007.9599999999999s)]
*  I think I'm dyslexic. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1010.88s)]
*  So that should count as I said it correctly in my head. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1011.76s)]
*  Wait, that wasn't just a bit, Christina Agatha? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1017.12s)]
*  No, I thought that's what it was. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1020.24s)]
*  Yeah, I ride the line. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1023.7199999999999s)]
*  You don't know what's a bit, what's not a bit. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1026.0s)]
*  You know, I'm very protected. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1027.72s)]
*  No one can really tell what's going on. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1030.18s)]
*  And then I can, you know, depending on who I'm talking to, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1031.76s)]
*  I can decide if it was dumb or not. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1034.56s)]
*  And you know, even just the title, Big Dumb Eyes, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1037.4599999999998s)]
*  but you already sort of made some self-deprecating [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1041.6599999999999s)]
*  allusions to your own level of intelligence. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1044.4599999999998s)]
*  But you know, I know that's sort of the persona, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1048.78s)]
*  but stand up, you know, almost by definition, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1050.78s)]
*  at least from my perspective, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1054.5s)]
*  really requires intelligence. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1056.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, comedians can act stupid or tell stupid jokes, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1059.2199999999998s)]
*  but you know, comedy involves crafting the material. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1062.58s)]
*  It involves observational insights and editing the material. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1067.12s)]
*  You need to have some facility with words. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  Are there aspects of comedic intelligence [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1073.28s)]
*  that you feel that do transfer over to day-to-day life? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1075.52s)]
*  It's being, awareness, being aware of just your surroundings [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  and what's going on. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1086.8s)]
*  You're looking for material. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  You're looking for things that happens [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1088.9199999999998s)]
*  to make a joke about or tell a story about. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1091.2s)]
*  So you're always very alert. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1094.16s)]
*  It's exhausting, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1097.0800000000002s)]
*  because it just doesn't feel like it turns off. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1098.8s)]
*  And you know, you analyze every interaction you have, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1101.16s)]
*  you know, like, I don't know if this person [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1104.96s)]
*  knows what he's talking about. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1106.72s)]
*  I like seeing when I see two people talk, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1107.8s)]
*  and I realize that they don't, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1110.28s)]
*  neither one of them really know [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1111.52s)]
*  what they're saying to each other, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1112.72s)]
*  and they're kind of on a different page. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1114.66s)]
*  That's very fun to watch. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  Is there an example recently that comes to mind [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1119.44s)]
*  of just something just out in the world [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1121.8s)]
*  that you observed and thought, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1123.52s)]
*  oh, maybe there's material in here for me? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1124.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, one of them was my dad. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1129.68s)]
*  My dad and my buddy, Nick Novicki. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  Nick, his eyesight's bad, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1136.72s)]
*  and he just kind of won't be paying attention. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1138.8s)]
*  And then my dad's older, and they won't. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1140.92s)]
*  So I watched them one time have a conversation [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1142.92s)]
*  in a hot tub. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1144.8s)]
*  And so Nick asked him how, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1147.52s)]
*  and he's like, how's everything going? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1149.72s)]
*  And my aunt was not doing well at the time, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1150.56s)]
*  so my dad's like, well, you know, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1152.6799999999998s)]
*  my wife's sister's not doing that well. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1154.96s)]
*  Then Nick goes, well, that's, you know, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1156.9199999999998s)]
*  it's good to hear, because he doesn't hear them. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  So they won't just acknowledge [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1161.12s)]
*  that neither one of them know what's going on. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1162.48s)]
*  So they're just having conversations. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1164.36s)]
*  And then Nick got out, dried off, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  and threw his towel away in a trash can, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1168.76s)]
*  because he thought it was the towel bin. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1170.76s)]
*  So something like that. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  You can tell no one's really invested [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1175.3s)]
*  in what each other's saying. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1177.3999999999999s)]
*  Just on the subject of larger ambitions, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1179.76s)]
*  something that I've seen you say in other interviews, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1182.76s)]
*  was, I think you mentioned, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1185.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you were being totally serious, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1187.24s)]
*  but wanting to build something to replace [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1189.04s)]
*  the old Opryland Amusement Park with Nate Land. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1190.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1195.2s)]
*  What's missing in the amusement park space [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1196.1200000000001s)]
*  that you think you could help fill? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1200.02s)]
*  Well, like, I mean, just talk about [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1203.0s)]
*  the state of Tennessee and Nashville alone. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1205.3200000000002s)]
*  Nashville is a great city that's booming, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1207.46s)]
*  and there's a lot to do. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1209.9s)]
*  There's not a lot to do with your family there. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1212.18s)]
*  So when you have kids and stuff, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1214.22s)]
*  you can go to Broadway, you can go drink, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1215.54s)]
*  and the bachelor parties and all this, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1217.5s)]
*  and a Titans game, and there is great stuff to do, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1219.14s)]
*  but there's not a lot of stuff [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1222.3400000000001s)]
*  that you can do with your family. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1223.18s)]
*  What I like about when people come to my shows [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1224.22s)]
*  is that it's children to grandparents are at these shows. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1226.42s)]
*  They're able to go do something as a family. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1229.6200000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of entertainment now [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1232.02s)]
*  is not made for the whole family. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1234.18s)]
*  It's usually, even television or movies [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1237.7s)]
*  can be very much separating in the fact that, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1240.5s)]
*  I'm watching Narcos, and my wife watches Housewives, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1245.66s)]
*  and there's not a show that we're [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1250.5s)]
*  necessarily watching together. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1252.54s)]
*  And so I do think there's a void in that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1254.18s)]
*  And so I'm just gonna, I look at stuff [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1258.18s)]
*  to go do with my daughter. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1262.38s)]
*  When we lived in California, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1263.88s)]
*  we would go to Disneyland all the time. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  And essentially, you look at Disney, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1267.72s)]
*  and it's like essentially I would like to be able [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1270.8s)]
*  to build something in that aspect where people can, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1272.56s)]
*  it's a big one, but. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1276.3600000000001s)]
*  You're not lacking in ambition. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1278.1200000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1280.04s)]
*  No, no, I don't care. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1281.52s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the ambition's like, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1282.72s)]
*  I don't know, I've done all this, I'm nobody, dude. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1285.16s)]
*  I just wanna make stuff that people have somewhere to go to [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1287.52s)]
*  with their whole family, and it's easy to watch, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1291.16s)]
*  and it's fun. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1294.3200000000002s)]
*  Maybe this is related, but in the acknowledgments [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1295.4s)]
*  of the book, right at the end of the acknowledgments, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1298.76s)]
*  you're writing to your fans, and you say, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1302.0s)]
*  or you write that, it might not always seem like it, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1304.48s)]
*  but I do have a plan, and I hope you keep rolling with me. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1306.6000000000001s)]
*  What's the plan? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1309.92s)]
*  The plan is, I mean, I'm kinda doing it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1312.76s)]
*  It's like the theme park, the plan is to be, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1314.68s)]
*  if you found me, if you like what I'm doing in this, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1318.08s)]
*  is I don't wanna betray that trust. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1321.24s)]
*  So the plan is just to trust me. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1323.32s)]
*  I don't plan on touring forever and doing stand-up forever. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1325.12s)]
*  I mean, I wanna make movies. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1328.04s)]
*  I think you get a lot of times that people can think, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1332.04s)]
*  you know, if you get too big, or you're gonna change, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1335.0s)]
*  or you're gonna go, if I mean, look in the South, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1338.36s)]
*  I can tell you right now, you can be like, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1340.36s)]
*  oh, you're Hollywood now, or you're this, or you're that, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1341.76s)]
*  or you're gonna, the audience is very much in my mind [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1344.44s)]
*  with everything that I will make, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1346.72s)]
*  and I will make stuff for, hopefully for them, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1347.92s)]
*  and with them, and like with them in mind. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1351.52s)]
*  I'm not doing it, again, I try not to do it for me. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not to get my point across. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1356.52s)]
*  My point does not matter. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1359.44s)]
*  It's for you, and so I want them to be able to trust [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1361.76s)]
*  that, you know, keep coming and see that I'm trying [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1366.32s)]
*  to do something I think that's a little [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1371.4s)]
*  against the grain right now, and weirdly enough, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1373.32s)]
*  something being broad is, you know, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1376.3999999999999s)]
*  like when I started comedy, I always thought, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1379.76s)]
*  some comics would be like, well, I'm not for everybody, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  and I was like, well, why would you not wanna be [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1384.6799999999998s)]
*  for everybody? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1386.28s)]
*  And so I want to be for everybody. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1387.84s)]
*  ["Sweet Home Alone"] [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1390.76s)]
*  After the break, Nate and I talk again, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1395.8s)]
*  and he tells me about his desire [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1398.04s)]
*  to serve a sorely neglected comedy audience. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1399.6399999999999s)]
*  Hi, Nate, how are you? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1407.08s)]
*  David, how are you? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1408.24s)]
*  I'm good, I'm good. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1409.6799999999998s)]
*  Thanks for taking the time to talk with me again. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1410.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1412.0s)]
*  You know, I saw a thing Mark Maron wrote earlier this year, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  just on his website, where he was writing [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1416.7199999999998s)]
*  about the importance of, for him, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1421.1999999999998s)]
*  of doing political comedy, and the way he put it [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1422.8s)]
*  was that like challenging people in real time [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1425.9599999999998s)]
*  with provocative material is where the real feels happen, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1428.7199999999998s)]
*  and I'm just curious to know your response [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1432.72s)]
*  to something like that, but is it just that a guy like him [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1436.8s)]
*  and a guy like you are almost working [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1439.52s)]
*  in two separate fields? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1441.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's just different types of comedy. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1443.24s)]
*  I went on the road for Mark Maron, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1446.32s)]
*  I opened for Mark Maron, I learned a lot that I do on stage [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  is stuff that I learned from him. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1452.24s)]
*  Maron is very much himself on stage, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  and so I always try to mimic that to be, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1456.2s)]
*  how close can I be to me offstage to onstage? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1459.0s)]
*  I think there's a place for that. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1464.08s)]
*  There's for Maron doing it, and you need that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1466.0s)]
*  You can have that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1470.2s)]
*  You can also have this. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1471.52s)]
*  I always joke that I'm a comics parents comic. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1473.08s)]
*  I think it's, you know, I like my, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1476.64s)]
*  I stand behind my standup, I work on it very, very hard, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1479.88s)]
*  but yeah, you do feel sometimes a little like, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1483.88s)]
*  because I'm clean, like, yeah, you can look at it, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1486.32s)]
*  like, wow, of course he sells all these tickets, it's easy. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1489.28s)]
*  It's like, he's not doing anything challenging. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1492.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, I kind of disagree with that, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1495.36s)]
*  but, because it's hard to, you know, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1497.6s)]
*  mainstream is not something that's easy to attain, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1501.36s)]
*  even with movies, you know what I mean? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1505.4399999999998s)]
*  Sandler did, that's not easy. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1507.52s)]
*  That's why there's not 40 Sandlers. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1509.3999999999999s)]
*  I remember you on The Tonight Show, 2016. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1512.52s)]
*  And you did a couple jokes about how you like Donald Trump, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1518.76s)]
*  but then the joke was basically like, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1524.32s)]
*  because you're so stupid that you believe [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1526.76s)]
*  all the insane things, insane promises that he made. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1529.8s)]
*  But then in the same routine, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1534.6s)]
*  then you say, you had these jokes about, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1537.08s)]
*  well, you wouldn't vote for him. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1539.36s)]
*  In that instance, then the joke wound up being, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1540.9199999999998s)]
*  because you were essentially too stupid [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1543.8s)]
*  to figure out how to go vote. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1545.72s)]
*  But would you do material even on that level now? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1548.4399999999998s)]
*  I would now, if I felt it. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1554.12s)]
*  So that was, the reason I wrote that joke [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1555.9199999999998s)]
*  was because everybody was saying they didn't like Trump, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1558.12s)]
*  every con comedian. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1560.32s)]
*  So all the jokes were saying I didn't like Trump. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1562.04s)]
*  So then I thought, how can I make a joke [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1564.3999999999999s)]
*  that say I do like him and be able to do it [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1566.32s)]
*  on The Tonight Show where I ride a line [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1569.28s)]
*  where no one's gonna get mad? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1571.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't want the people voting for Trump to get mad. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1573.0s)]
*  I don't want the people that are not voting [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1575.28s)]
*  for Trump to get mad. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1577.36s)]
*  I wanted to say the opposite [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1579.24s)]
*  of what everybody else was saying. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1580.6399999999999s)]
*  So if I have an idea and I can do that, I will do that. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1581.96s)]
*  I do like that challenge. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1586.24s)]
*  Are there other topics like that that come to mind [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1589.36s)]
*  where you feel an instinct to go against the herd [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1591.52s)]
*  in that way? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1595.68s)]
*  Yeah, I did it with the peanut allergies. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1596.52s)]
*  I had a joke about airplanes, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1600.52s)]
*  when they say you can have peanuts, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1602.8s)]
*  who are these adults addicted to these peanuts this bad? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1604.84s)]
*  And so that was one that, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1609.24s)]
*  there's a lot of people that would make fun [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1611.84s)]
*  of the peanut allergy aspect. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1613.1200000000001s)]
*  And so it's just going the opposite way [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1615.36s)]
*  and just defending the kids that have the peanut allergies. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1617.36s)]
*  I liked that. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1621.04s)]
*  I like riding that line and not just, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1622.1200000000001s)]
*  and just again, and when you put it, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1626.8s)]
*  when you make it self-centered, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1628.56s)]
*  it's much easier to ride the line. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1630.2s)]
*  All right, help me understand this aspect of you [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1632.56s)]
*  because I was thinking about it [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1636.32s)]
*  and I can't quite wrap my head around it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1638.24s)]
*  So you're this seemingly humble, low-key guy [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1639.8s)]
*  who is happy living on a cul-de-sac [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1643.52s)]
*  and doesn't wanna go Hollywood, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1646.56s)]
*  but then you also alluded to ambitions to build Nate Land [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1649.28s)]
*  into, and this is your comparison, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1654.32s)]
*  like a Disney-level production, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1655.8s)]
*  so that was just not a normal-sized goal, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1660.48s)]
*  even for a famous comedian. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1662.4399999999998s)]
*  So is there another more aggressive side to you [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1665.36s)]
*  when it comes to business? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1669.72s)]
*  Help me reconcile the two seemingly disparate sides [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1672.04s)]
*  of Nate Bargetzi. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1674.8s)]
*  You know, it is. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm very driven. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1677.72s)]
*  I'm very driven. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1679.24s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't, when I didn't go to college, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1680.36s)]
*  barely made it out of high school, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  like it's like, my mind just thinks, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1683.48s)]
*  because I don't understand most business stuff, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1686.36s)]
*  so you kinda just, I think I just, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1691.48s)]
*  maybe it's naive of just, I'm like, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1694.84s)]
*  well, why can't we do it that way? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1697.24s)]
*  You know, when everybody's like, you can't, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1698.48s)]
*  I'm like, well, why not? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1701.08s)]
*  I'm not buying the whole Yokel stick, buddy. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1702.56s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1704.76s)]
*  I'm the thinker, the talker, like the visionary, I guess. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1705.6s)]
*  And then you're good at putting people around you [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1710.76s)]
*  that do know all that kind of stuff, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1714.04s)]
*  you know, because that I don't, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1717.1599999999999s)]
*  I never had a real job, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1718.84s)]
*  so I don't know any of that stuff. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1720.92s)]
*  What's the last idea you had, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1724.72s)]
*  the most recent idea you had, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1726.2s)]
*  where you then said to someone you work with, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1727.64s)]
*  like, can we make that happen? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1729.2800000000002s)]
*  So on the arena tour, when I first started going, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1733.5600000000002s)]
*  our screens, because you're in an arena, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  I wanted the screens to be bigger. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1739.5200000000002s)]
*  I was like, they should be bigger, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1741.88s)]
*  because I want the experience for the audience [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1743.0400000000002s)]
*  to be as great as it can be. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1745.6000000000001s)]
*  And I was told they can't be bigger. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1747.76s)]
*  And I just remember, I was like, well, that doesn't make, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1751.28s)]
*  I don't think that makes sense. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1753.56s)]
*  And I'm fine with being told no, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1755.68s)]
*  but I just want to know it went through the whole system. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1757.4s)]
*  I want to be told exactly, like, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1760.92s)]
*  the building's not big enough, or whatever. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1762.92s)]
*  And we, for this next tour, we do have bigger screens. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1765.92s)]
*  I mean, I get a lot of people when I say [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1769.0s)]
*  I want to do a theme park, and I've had it with friends, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1770.3600000000001s)]
*  where I say, I want to do this, and they're like, why? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1773.48s)]
*  Why would you, you know, you can't do this? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1775.8s)]
*  You basically get told you can't do anything, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1778.56s)]
*  because no one, you know, because it doesn't make sense [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1781.36s)]
*  for, I guess, how I've lived to think that I want [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1784.6s)]
*  to go do all this other stuff. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1787.8s)]
*  What would be in the Nate Land theme park? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1789.72s)]
*  Just rides. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1793.2s)]
*  No, I thought about, you know, different parts, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1796.56s)]
*  and ideally, I would want it to be [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1800.9199999999998s)]
*  like a Universal Studios kind of thing, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1802.48s)]
*  where we can be shooting movies on one part, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1804.48s)]
*  and then you have the theme park on the other, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1807.36s)]
*  and kind of just build that. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  I just want to build a world where people can be discovered. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  I think that's a big driving point for me, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1815.9599999999998s)]
*  is like, when I came up, I think a lot of people [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1817.7199999999998s)]
*  would not get out of the way for the next younger people. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1821.6799999999998s)]
*  They're in comedy clubs, when you're coming up, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1825.0s)]
*  and you can't get spots at that club, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1827.1999999999998s)]
*  because the guys that have been there for 15 years, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1829.56s)]
*  like, are not moving or going somewhere else. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1833.04s)]
*  And so, I want to have places for new artists [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1835.76s)]
*  to be able to, I don't know, come do something. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1839.72s)]
*  I don't want to be another one of those naysayers, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1842.6s)]
*  but like a Universal Studios slash theme park, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1844.76s)]
*  I think you'd need like a billion dollars to do that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1848.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, we got some stuff we gotta get through. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1850.96s)]
*  You know, I was going to ask you how much money you have, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1853.84s)]
*  if you could give it to me. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1857.6s)]
*  Every, we're asking for everyone doing a VIMO. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1859.68s)]
*  You need a lot of stuff, I do agree. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1862.32s)]
*  You need a lot of things. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1864.8s)]
*  The one thing I've learned though, is in the business, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1866.68s)]
*  money's not the problem. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1869.84s)]
*  People have a lot of money. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1871.12s)]
*  There's a lot of money, and money gets used [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1872.52s)]
*  in a lot of different ways and stuff like that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1874.32s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't, I mean, hopefully we can get there. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1877.6s)]
*  This is not something that is gonna be tomorrow. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1882.1599999999999s)]
*  But, I mean, I don't, you know, I feel like driven to do it. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1886.32s)]
*  And, you know, so, yeah, we're gonna give it a go. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1891.4399999999998s)]
*  I wanna go back to the book. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1896.58s)]
*  In it, you mentioned that you were raised Baptist, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1898.1599999999999s)]
*  your parents are Baptist, and you write very movingly [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1901.9199999999998s)]
*  about how your dad at one point found a deeper level [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1904.6799999999998s)]
*  of faith into the, you call it his moment of testimony. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1908.84s)]
*  Have you had a moment of testimony? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1913.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I'm, I feel sometimes [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1916.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm having it now, you know? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1921.52s)]
*  I mean, I think that's where the drive [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1923.2s)]
*  and all this stuff is coming from, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1925.52s)]
*  to make sure that you can bring your child [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1927.4s)]
*  to my standup show, that, you know, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1930.76s)]
*  that I want you to come as a family and you go do stuff. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1932.8000000000002s)]
*  And I think about those moments of, you know, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1936.5600000000002s)]
*  I have with my daughter, all these little dumb moments [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1938.92s)]
*  of you going to the movies with your family, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1941.8000000000002s)]
*  because it's fun to get on, watch your kid try to talk you [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1945.16s)]
*  into buying candy and popcorn and all these little silly [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1947.64s)]
*  kind of moments that you think back on. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1951.0s)]
*  So I think I'm going through it now. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1954.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it's constantly having to work on it, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1956.52s)]
*  constantly just reminding myself to be out of it [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1959.68s)]
*  and make sure that this life is not about me. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1961.68s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, it's just a constant, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1964.88s)]
*  yeah, it's constant going on. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1966.92s)]
*  So I think I follow what you're saying. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1969.16s)]
*  And the idea is that like, there's almost like a deeper [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1972.0s)]
*  motivation or a spiritual impetus between trying [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1977.64s)]
*  to create these moments for families [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1981.04s)]
*  where families can be together. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1984.16s)]
*  And that in some ways, you're tempted doing service [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1986.52s)]
*  for God, is that right? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1991.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a service to, you know, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1993.28s)]
*  it's a big belief to be, I am second, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1996.36s)]
*  being second to God, second to your family, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=1998.56s)]
*  second to, you know, I believe the audience, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2000.4s)]
*  second to everybody. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2002.52s)]
*  You're, you kind of live to serve. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2003.88s)]
*  So it's very much a calling in that aspect that I feel. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2006.0400000000002s)]
*  But again, it's like, it's like, it's trying to ride [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2013.0800000000002s)]
*  that balance of where I don't want, you know, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2016.0400000000002s)]
*  and I don't want anybody that's not this or that [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2021.8400000000001s)]
*  or whatever, whatever everybody is, is not really, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2025.0800000000002s)]
*  that doesn't matter. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2029.2s)]
*  I just want to make something that all of them can be [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2030.3200000000002s)]
*  in the room together. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2032.8000000000002s)]
*  And I feel it's driven on a bigger purpose for me, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2034.28s)]
*  but you know, it's like everybody's their own, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2036.92s)]
*  everybody has their own things. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2040.0800000000002s)]
*  I sense a little hesitation on your part in wanting to say [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2041.96s)]
*  like there's a spiritual motivation behind it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2045.0s)]
*  But I think you're nervous. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2047.3600000000001s)]
*  As you get worried about being laid, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2048.84s)]
*  you don't want it to be this kind of thing. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2049.96s)]
*  Cause you know, being, you know, stuff gets faith based [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  or stuff gets like that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2055.2400000000002s)]
*  Like people write stuff off. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2056.2400000000002s)]
*  Or they take it, especially now in very different ways. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2058.72s)]
*  Yeah, but that, but you know, it's like the moments [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2061.9199999999996s)]
*  when you're with your kids and your wife or your partner [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2063.9599999999996s)]
*  and you're all doing something and like just having [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2067.64s)]
*  a joyful time. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2070.24s)]
*  I'm not a particularly religious person, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2071.56s)]
*  but those are holy moments. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2073.16s)]
*  I mean, that's where really what it comes from. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2074.6s)]
*  I remember our daughter's first movie was Moana. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2076.4799999999996s)]
*  And so going to sit and watch it in the back, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2079.8799999999997s)]
*  we sat in the very back and you know, it's like, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2083.12s)]
*  the whole experience of that day is like, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2086.52s)]
*  that's something that I remember. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2088.52s)]
*  And that's like, you know, that's a dumb day [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2089.6s)]
*  in the grand scheme of things. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2092.4s)]
*  You're not doing, no one's in school. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2094.0s)]
*  No one's taking a test. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2095.36s)]
*  No one's, it's not this crazy important days, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2096.44s)]
*  but those kind of days that are, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2098.64s)]
*  those are the ones that you tend to go back to and remember. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2101.56s)]
*  And so yeah, creating those moments. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2105.28s)]
*  I always see older, I have a lot of grandmothers [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2108.44s)]
*  come to my shows and they love me. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2112.92s)]
*  I do really good with grandmothers. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2115.24s)]
*  And I always love that because I don't think [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2117.4799999999996s)]
*  they really got, I don't think there's much being made [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2120.9199999999996s)]
*  that they could go to or that they want to go to. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2124.4399999999996s)]
*  Certainly not stand up comedy. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2127.6s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwk5weXnx5E&t=2129.2s)]
