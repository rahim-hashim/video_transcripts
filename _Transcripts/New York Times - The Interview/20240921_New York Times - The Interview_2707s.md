# 'The Interview': Sally Rooney Thinks Career Growth Is Overrated
**New York Times - The Interview:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm David Marchese. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=6.76s)]
*  The arrival of Sally Rooney's new novel, Intermezzo, this month is absolutely one of the fall's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=10.96s)]
*  biggest publishing events. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=16.2s)]
*  Not only for all the readers hungry for new fiction from the 33-year-old Irish author, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=18.04s)]
*  and that includes myself, but for all the book lovers, again myself included, eager [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=22.0s)]
*  for the flood of think pieces and commentary that Intermezzo will surely spawn. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=26.6s)]
*  Rooney is one of those rare authors who's been able to earn a mass readership as well [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=31.76s)]
*  as serious critical attention. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=35.32s)]
*  Maybe I should just say attention period. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  The popular success is, on some level, easier to understand. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=39.28s)]
*  Her four novels are beautifully written relationship studies, someone else might dare call them [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=43.72s)]
*  romances, that weave together politics, sex, moral philosophy, dry humor, and a distinctly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=47.8s)]
*  millennial unease with the state of the world. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=53.52s)]
*  It's a compelling combo, one that found an even broader fan base after her first two [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=56.4s)]
*  novels, Conversations with Friends and Normal People, were adapted into buzzy TV series. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=60.64s)]
*  The lightning rod aspect to Rooney and her work is a little more mysterious. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=66.92s)]
*  I'm sure any writer who gets held up, like Rooney does as the voice of a generation, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=70.48s)]
*  is sure to be scrutinized. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=74.84s)]
*  But the outsized amount and the intensity of both the praise and the criticism of her [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=76.88s)]
*  output feels a little confusing, including to Rooney, who as she told me, would much [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=80.72s)]
*  rather let her work speak for itself. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=85.4s)]
*  And yet, here's my conversation with Sally Rooney. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=88.36s)]
*  I was just reading a brief interview you did with The New Yorker that ran in conjunction [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=100.68s)]
*  with an excerpt from Intermezzo. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=106.04s)]
*  And I think in there it said that, you said that it's stressful to publish your work and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=109.04s)]
*  maybe even more stressful to wait for it to be published. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=113.84s)]
*  Why is that? Because I can imagine that this is the nice time before you have to worry [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=117.2s)]
*  about how people are actually responding to it or if it's selling or anything. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=121.76s)]
*  Now it's like you just got the thing ready to go. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=126.44s)]
*  Yeah. But the way that books are published means that actually a lot of the stuff that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=128.44s)]
*  I find stressful is kind of like front loaded. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  So it happens that, of course, the conversation that we're having right now and the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=137.68s)]
*  conversations that I'll be having with other journalists about the book will be happening [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=140.56s)]
*  before the book is ever published. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=143.84s)]
*  And that means that the part that involves me, in a sense, putting myself out there and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=145.52s)]
*  trying to work out a way of talking about my book happens before the public has had a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=150.68s)]
*  chance to read it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=156.28s)]
*  And so it's just a weird mental space to be in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=157.76s)]
*  I feel like everything that I had to say went into the book and I have nothing left to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=162.56s)]
*  give that isn't already in the text. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=167.08s)]
*  Do you recall if it's ever happened where you've paid attention to the discourse around [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=169.84s)]
*  the book and then had the thought like, oh, I wish I had a chance to respond to that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=174.8s)]
*  I try and this may sound insincere, but hand on heart, I do actually try not to look at [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=179.4s)]
*  the discourse around my work. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=186.8s)]
*  Of course, some of it filters through and people will just like tell me, you know, things [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=188.12s)]
*  that are being said about my work or whatever. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=192.6s)]
*  But I do my best not to look at it too much because I think it would lead me down a bad [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  path. And then do I ever feel like responding to it? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=199.52s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=203.56s)]
*  I don't need to be over the reader's shoulder saying, what do you think of that page? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=204.76s)]
*  I need to kind of accept that at that point, my work is done, be it good or bad, and let [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=209.68s)]
*  the reader or the critic have their own conversation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=215.08s)]
*  You know, maybe this will be a preview of ways in which people might respond to the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=219.16s)]
*  new book. But the first question I had about Intermezzo is to do with the fact that the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=223.84s)]
*  two main protagonists, the brothers Ivan and Peter, are obviously guys. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  And obviously, there was Connell and normal people was a protagonist of that book. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=237.08s)]
*  But Ivan and Peter really seem central in a way that men haven't been in your books. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=241.2s)]
*  And I'm curious if you felt it was a particular challenge to write from a male perspective? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=248.96s)]
*  Yeah, interestingly, the first voice that came to the page for me in this project was [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=255.28s)]
*  Margaret's voice. So the the character who becomes entangled in Ivan's life in the course [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=261.16s)]
*  of the book. So it certainly wasn't that I sat down thinking time to write a book about men. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I have to write a book where the male voice is central or anything like that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=272.56s)]
*  I thought that it was going to be Margaret's story. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=277.72s)]
*  Of course, I knew that Ivan was a big part of that story. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=280.48s)]
*  But his sort of voice came along rather late in the writing process. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=283.92s)]
*  So it definitely was not a conscious project of trying to write about men or trying to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  write about masculinity. I just felt my way through the story that seemed to emerge when [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  I encountered these characters and I kind of followed where they led me, which is what I [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=301.68s)]
*  always try to do. Of course, then I had moments of self-reflection and self-consciousness [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=306.24s)]
*  because I was thinking, what do I know, you know, anything about what I'm writing about? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=310.44s)]
*  But on the other hand, I think and again, this is from just having said that I try to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=318.92s)]
*  ignore all discourse about my work. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=327.04s)]
*  Nonetheless, it has permeated through, filters through that I'm aware that people think [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=328.6s)]
*  that my work is heavily autobiographical and in fact, it isn't. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=333.48s)]
*  So it felt like they were just fictional characters like all my other fictional characters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  And I was intrigued by them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=342.12s)]
*  I found them really interesting. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  I liked being with them on the page. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=345.6s)]
*  And so the question of gender felt very secondary and it certainly wasn't a conscious theme [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  that I was trying to explore or say something about as it were. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=352.04s)]
*  But there were moments where I thought, have I have I got any of this right and am I [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=354.72s)]
*  overstepping myself or something? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=359.04s)]
*  This is not a spoiler or anything, but Peter and Ivan have lost their father. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=362.04s)]
*  And I was curious about your experience of grief. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  And if in that instance, you were writing from personal reflection or if you weren't, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=370.36s)]
*  did you feel like it was a particularly difficult task to write into a feeling that deep [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  that you had not experienced? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=382.36s)]
*  I think that's a fair question, but I've never been conscious in writing about any [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  emotional experience that any of my characters have had of drawing on something that I have [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=390.84s)]
*  felt or known in my own life. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=397.88s)]
*  The relationship between fiction and the life of the author is a very live relationship [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=401.44s)]
*  in the minds of readers and critics. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's a completely unknown relationship in my life. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  I've never, ever think about it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=417.32s)]
*  Only when I publish a book do I ever even have to wonder what the relationship between my [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=419.64s)]
*  fiction and my own life is. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=424.2s)]
*  I sometimes feel that my work is like a little bit like what it might be like to be an actor. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=426.32s)]
*  Like I get very into character and I inhabit that consciousness. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=433.08s)]
*  And that allows me to write about what it is that the character is undergoing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=438.4s)]
*  And I'm not in any way saying to myself, well, I know that it would be like this because [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=445.56s)]
*  I remember when something analogous happened to me and I felt like this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=451.32s)]
*  And I think if I caught myself doing that, I'd think there was something wrong with the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=455.28s)]
*  way that I was working. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=458.72s)]
*  I think at the moment that I found myself reaching for such a thing, I would think [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=459.88s)]
*  there's something I've lost touch with my character in some way. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=463.48s)]
*  I'm not going to belabor this because there's a lot of other things I want to ask you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  about. But do you find yourself having thoughts about the writers that are meaningful to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=470.84s)]
*  you that it seems like people have about you and your work? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=478.32s)]
*  No. And no, I'm curiously. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  So you've never read a biography of a novelist you liked or something like that? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=488.12s)]
*  I've actually never read a biography of a writer. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=491.96s)]
*  Never. And I when. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=495.36s)]
*  There's some good ones. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=496.8s)]
*  And people say that there are. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  And I and I and I recommended them on a regular basis. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think I must have some kind of mental block to reading them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=502.88s)]
*  Of course, there are, let's say, natural gaps in my reading. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=507.32s)]
*  I wish there weren't. But I think this is more than a gap. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=510.88s)]
*  I think it's like a resistance. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=513.36s)]
*  It's something that is like a stubborn lack of curiosity in me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=514.84s)]
*  I don't tend to wonder about the relationship between the writers life and the writers work. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I think that part of that is. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=527.56s)]
*  I was going to say part of it might be responsive to a sense that that's an imposed [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  relationship that comes from outside and that I want to resist engaging in that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=539.52s)]
*  But I think part of it is a genuine lack of interest, because before I ever became a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=543.48s)]
*  published writer, I also didn't read writers biographies or even really know anything [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=548.76s)]
*  about writers. I would know what period they lived in, but I would not know anything [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=552.12s)]
*  about. That's it. Yeah, that's kind of it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=557.08s)]
*  And I'm still a little bit like that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=559.56s)]
*  So I think and maybe that's why I struggle to answer the kind of questions that you are [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=561.36s)]
*  very reasonably asking, because I don't read work in that way. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=566.88s)]
*  Yeah. Then do you have or what might the apprehensions be about sharing your political [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=569.4s)]
*  views? You've written about being against the war in Gaza, for example, or abortion [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=576.56s)]
*  in Ireland, you know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  So it seems if you're willing to do that, surely you're aware that making your opinions [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=583.88s)]
*  known about these kinds of divisive issues, you know, sort of like opening up the possibility [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=589.92s)]
*  that people might conflate Sally Rooney and her your your work. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=595.0s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=600.1199999999999s)]
*  Well, that to me feels like a different avenue of conversation. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  And it's interesting that to you, those two things feel quite close and to me, they feel [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=608.2399999999999s)]
*  quite different. So I'm interested by that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=611.2399999999999s)]
*  And I'm actually struck by that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=612.8399999999999s)]
*  I think to an extent, when we talk about having spoken out against the war in Gaza and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=614.2399999999999s)]
*  having written as I did about the housing crisis in Ireland, having written obviously about [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=621.76s)]
*  abortion a couple of years ago now in the Irish context, I feel that I have been given [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=625.8s)]
*  a very privileged position in public discourse, particularly in Ireland. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=631.8s)]
*  I feel that I have the power to intervene in public conversations and I still feel [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=636.8s)]
*  disinclined to do it unless I feel that there might be something that I could contribute [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=643.24s)]
*  that I haven't seen said elsewhere. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=647.12s)]
*  And so in cases like that, I do feel that there is something like for some reason, I'm [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=649.28s)]
*  not I don't want to use the words moral duty, but I do feel a little bit of an obligation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=654.92s)]
*  And then how that relates to my work, I think that my fiction is politically committed in [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  a sense. I do think that my political beliefs are rooted in commitment to the dignity of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=666.4399999999999s)]
*  human life, the avenue through which I have ended up theorizing that universality of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=675.4s)]
*  human dignity and human rights is through a sort of Marxist framework. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=684.6s)]
*  And I suppose that I do feel that that's present in my fiction, not that I feel that anybody [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  who picks up one of my books is going to get a political ideology from that or is going [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=696.44s)]
*  to agree with me about political points they didn't agree with me on before they started [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=702.4s)]
*  reading it. So I suppose not didactic in that sense, but that those commitments run [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=706.48s)]
*  through my work. But what's interesting to me is that you raise the question of whether [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=712.16s)]
*  that invites people to read my work in a personal way. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=716.36s)]
*  And I think, but what does that have to do with anything? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=719.24s)]
*  I mean, I feel like my political work is there in public and I can stand by it and I'm [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  happy to discuss it. And my fiction is the same and it's there and I share it with the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=728.56s)]
*  public and I'm happy to talk about it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=732.64s)]
*  And that all feels very separate from my personal life, which I never want to talk about [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  and doesn't feel like it has anything to do with my work. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=738.8s)]
*  So I think that those feel like three separate things to me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  Two of them I can talk about in different ways and for different reasons. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  And then the third one, I can't or don't want to. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=749.88s)]
*  But I understand why to you they feel interlinked. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  And I think that does make sense. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  There are stylistic aspects to Intermezzo that make it different from your past books. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=758.88s)]
*  But of course, in another way, it's not that different. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, there's like people have intense relationships, you know, and they're sort of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=769.12s)]
*  drawn together, kept apart from each other, trying to get back to each other. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=774.44s)]
*  You know, they like, I don't know what the term would be, socio-cultural setting is not [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=779.32s)]
*  like wildly different. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=785.32s)]
*  I guess the way I think about it is like really any character from any one of your [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=786.36s)]
*  novels could walk into another one of those novels and you wouldn't be like, what the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  hell is that person doing here? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=794.12s)]
*  You know, they would sort of fit. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=795.24s)]
*  Do you ever wonder if your books are too similar? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=796.96s)]
*  And do you think about how you're writing might change in the future? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=802.36s)]
*  I think that's a really good question. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  And I would have to answer it by saying I don't care about my career. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=808.48s)]
*  So I don't think about my work as belonging to me even really. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=813.84s)]
*  I think about when I'm writing a project, how do I make this book the perfect version [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=818.24s)]
*  of what it can be? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=822.96s)]
*  I've got these characters and I feel like they've walked into my life. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=823.96s)]
*  That's a kind of gift and I love being with them. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=828.9200000000001s)]
*  And I never think about it in relation to my other work. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=831.8000000000001s)]
*  And I never think about what people will say about how close or how distant it is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=834.28s)]
*  from my oeuvre. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think of myself as even having an oeuvre. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=841.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't think about those questions at all. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  And I don't feel myself thinking about my growth as an artist, if you will. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=844.48s)]
*  I'm skeptical that you don't think about that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=850.64s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  I think it's fair to be skeptical. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=852.64s)]
*  And I think that there is a huge cultural fixation with novelty and growth. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=854.96s)]
*  Like, I mean, our whole economic system is obviously built on constant, permanent, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=862.84s)]
*  ceaseless growth. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=866.68s)]
*  We all have to grow. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=867.36s)]
*  You know, everything has to grow all the time. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  Get bigger, sell more and be different. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=870.12s)]
*  Novelty, you know, reinvention. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=874.48s)]
*  Those are like the principles of our present culture. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=877.48s)]
*  Almost, it feels like. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=880.76s)]
*  And I don't find that very interesting. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=882.56s)]
*  I feel like I am so grateful when I get a new idea for a project. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=885.48s)]
*  And by new, I just mean it has new characters in it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=891.88s)]
*  And to me, I know what you I know when you say one of my characters could walk into [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=895.8s)]
*  another of my novels, perhaps that is true, but they haven't. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=900.08s)]
*  So there is no Ivan in any of my previous books. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=903.52s)]
*  He is a new guy. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=906.08s)]
*  And for me, like, that's enough. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=907.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=909.52s)]
*  But I do understand that people might feel, you know, she's repeating herself [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=910.08s)]
*  because it's just another book about people, same age range, same milieu. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  They're in some of them are in Dublin. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  Some of them are in the west of Ireland and they're traveling back and forth and [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=918.96s)]
*  having these relationships and there is sex and there's talking and they have [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=922.2800000000001s)]
*  political beliefs or whatever. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=925.84s)]
*  Like that's yeah, that is all my books. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=927.52s)]
*  And perhaps it always will be. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=928.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=930.64s)]
*  I guess I would say, and I'm wary of saying this because it could sound like I'm [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  trying to compare myself to the great masters of the past and I absolutely am [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=935.72s)]
*  not. But I suppose what I would say is that when I look at writers whose work has [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=940.44s)]
*  transformed my life and, you know, I look at the work of Austin, I look at the work [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=944.1600000000001s)]
*  of Henry James, Dostoevsky, those writers produced work that very much adheres to [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=948.24s)]
*  what you're describing, where it feels like a figure from one of their books [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  could stroll into any of the other novels that they wrote and be very much at home. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=957.4s)]
*  But each of the novels is its own just world and it's intense and it's profound [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=961.96s)]
*  and it's beautiful. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=968.0400000000001s)]
*  And of course, that's what I'm striving for. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  I want to ask sort of a question more to do with formal qualities of your work. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=970.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, beautiful world, where are you? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=977.0s)]
*  Obviously you were trying things out with, I don't even know the way to phrase, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=979.12s)]
*  like not conveying interiority in big sections of that book. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=983.4s)]
*  And in Intermezzo, the Peter sections are there's sort of like a stream of [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=988.12s)]
*  consciousness feel to them. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=994.36s)]
*  Like do those sort of formal experiments, do they come out of character or do you [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=996.56s)]
*  have the thought, you know, this is something I would like to try formally and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1005.2s)]
*  here is an opportunity to do it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1009.08s)]
*  I think it's the former. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  I think they strictly come out of not only character, but a scenario. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1013.4000000000001s)]
*  So I think often at the beginning of a project and especially in the two books [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  that you've mentioned, my third and fourth, I have found it difficult to know [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  where to begin with the writing process. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1027.8s)]
*  With this one, as soon as I sort of conceived of Peter, the older brother [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1031.2s)]
*  character, as soon as he kind of walked into my brain, I wrote down what is now [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1037.6s)]
*  the first page of the novel almost instantly and it's hardly changed. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  It was like this kind of, and as you call it, a stream of consciousness. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1047.8s)]
*  It was like a very fragmented fluid way of trying to grapple with his interiority. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1052.84s)]
*  And it just started like that and basically kind of went on like that. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  So there was never a point where I consciously thought to myself, I'd love to [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1063.0s)]
*  have a go at writing sentences like that or trying to construct a scene like that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1066.92s)]
*  It was always just, how do I get closer or how do I get the reader to understand [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  what I'm seeing in my head? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1080.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'll do anything to get to the idea. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1082.52s)]
*  And so whatever language I have to use to get to the idea, I'll use it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1086.4s)]
*  Do you feel like you're just trying to get to the idea when you're writing sex scenes? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1091.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to get to the idea. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1096.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm certainly trying to convey the idea. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1098.96s)]
*  Yeah, because I think what's really important for me all the way through all my work [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1103.8s)]
*  is human dynamics, interpersonal dynamics. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1109.52s)]
*  And so often the, you know, crucial changes in the dynamic between two people [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1113.8s)]
*  or more, but usually in my work too, can happen in the context of a sexual interaction. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1123.76s)]
*  So when there are sort of crucial shifts in how two people relate to each other, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1130.24s)]
*  I think in my work, well, those shifts have to happen on the page. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1135.24s)]
*  I can't just catch up later and say, oh, something really important happened [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1138.32s)]
*  between them, but I didn't want to write about that. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1141.28s)]
*  So you just have to take my word for it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1143.0s)]
*  That's not always an easy thing to do. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1144.6399999999999s)]
*  It can be a challenge. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1146.56s)]
*  Stylistically, it can be a challenge in terms of just [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  what I would call petty personal reasons. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1151.96s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1153.88s)]
*  But I feel like to be true to my work, I have to go there because if I'm committed [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1155.56s)]
*  to writing about how two people can come to mean something to one another, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1160.64s)]
*  to be a huge part of each other's lives, sometimes I have to go into [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1165.4s)]
*  the most intimate moments that they share. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1170.24s)]
*  I have to say, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1172.48s)]
*  also, I feel hyper self-conscious about raising the topic of sex writing with you [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1174.16s)]
*  because I really don't want to come off as remotely skeevy or anything like that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1177.8s)]
*  But [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1181.72s)]
*  your writing about sex is so not corny. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1183.76s)]
*  Are the writers who you feel like you learned from? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1186.44s)]
*  Do you have friends that you show that writing to? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1188.84s)]
*  And you're like, let me know if this sounds corny. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1192.36s)]
*  Like, how do you see now? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1193.92s)]
*  You've set me up for failure here because if I start talking about how I avoid [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1195.0s)]
*  cringe, you know, a lot of people think I don't. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1198.52s)]
*  So, of course, I'm going to confidently say, well, here's how. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1202.44s)]
*  My intention was not to trick you. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1205.68s)]
*  Here's how I avoid ever doing anything embarrassing in my work. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's absolutely fair for people to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1211.8000000000002s)]
*  have the exact response that you've described not having to my work and to say, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1214.2800000000002s)]
*  oh, my God, I'm cringing so much that I can't read the scene. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  I can't finish the scene because it's so full of words that I find just horrible on the page. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1222.16s)]
*  I think that for me, it feels like a little bit of a tightrope act. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1228.48s)]
*  I think all prose writing does actually, but particularly, I think, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1231.48s)]
*  those very intimate scenes. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1237.16s)]
*  One of the challenges that this presents is that my vocabulary becomes very [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1239.3200000000002s)]
*  repetitive and narrow in those sections, and that becomes an editorial [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1244.88s)]
*  conversation because I think part of it is I want to convey a sense of repetition. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1249.64s)]
*  In a way, I want to create an enclosed sense of intimacy and sometimes [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1255.16s)]
*  repeating vocabulary can help to create that sense of enclosure and closeness. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1260.76s)]
*  But also I know that that can, with too much of it, become just unpleasant to read [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1267.72s)]
*  and feel just clunky and wrong. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1274.76s)]
*  So it's again, a little bit of a tightrope thing. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1276.8s)]
*  And there's such a large degree of subjectivity there, both aesthetically [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  and I think erotically, if you want to put it that way. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1283.52s)]
*  So I just do the best that I can, which is such an unimpressive answer. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1286.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1293.24s)]
*  And you're, what are you, 33, something like that? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1294.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, 33. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1299.56s)]
*  You have done exceedingly well for yourself. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1300.6s)]
*  You have an audience. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1304.08s)]
*  I know you try not to pay attention to the discourse around it, but a lot of it is [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1305.6s)]
*  framed as the people said, like first great millennial novelist. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1308.9599999999998s)]
*  There's cornier phrases. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1313.48s)]
*  A salinger for the Snapchat generation is one that comes to mind. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1315.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm just curious if you think about your youth in relation to your work and what it means. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  It's so difficult to think about one's own youth for lack of comparison, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1326.48s)]
*  because I've never been older than I am now. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1332.48s)]
*  I'm obviously not as young as I was when I started publishing. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1334.8400000000001s)]
*  So I kind of feel like I'm exiting the period of [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1338.28s)]
*  certainly extreme sort of noticeable youth and entering more what I would call normal age. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1342.56s)]
*  I'm sure that in 10 years, 20 years, I will feel differently about how [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1348.24s)]
*  about how my youth or my age will say, inflected my [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1355.24s)]
*  writing, my position in the culture and indeed even how my work is talked about [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1361.08s)]
*  than I do now, because it's so hard to have a sense of those things. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1364.4399999999998s)]
*  So I think certainly part of this, and it's interesting how I keep bringing [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1368.1999999999998s)]
*  the questions back to the public reception of my work, which I started out by saying [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1374.6799999999998s)]
*  I know nothing about and don't have any interest in, which it seems like that was [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1378.48s)]
*  a lie because I keep talking about it, right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1381.32s)]
*  But it's because I'm talking to you. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's like now I'm being placed back into a position that has started to feel [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1388.36s)]
*  unfamiliar, that I almost feel I don't belong in, that I have a complicated [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1395.1599999999999s)]
*  relationship with, and of course, that's like dredging up all these feelings [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1398.2399999999998s)]
*  about my public role, and that's what I keep incessantly talking about while saying, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1401.9599999999998s)]
*  and I don't care about that. I never think about that, by the way. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1407.12s)]
*  So that's yeah, I guess that's probably more revealing than I would like. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1409.9199999999998s)]
*  But of course, I do think that my youth has been an element in the reception of my work. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1413.1599999999999s)]
*  And I'm also aware, of course, that my youth is very much at play in the work [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1418.6s)]
*  that I've written because I'm very much aware that I belong to a generation that [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1423.12s)]
*  came of age around the financial crisis, and I am aware of how that cultural [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1427.36s)]
*  experience, that generational experience is there in my work. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1434.7199999999998s)]
*  Like I think my character's relationship with housing, for instance, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1439.04s)]
*  it's been there from the first book. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1442.04s)]
*  It's not that I sat down and said to myself, I'm going to be a novelist who [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1443.32s)]
*  writes about my generation's relationship to housing or to the housing crisis. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1447.32s)]
*  That was never consciously on my mind, but of course, it was simply in the air. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1451.76s)]
*  So I am I am aware of how [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1456.36s)]
*  of how generational my work is, but I find myself a little bit hesitant to speak [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1461.16s)]
*  about it because it can be a difficult topic. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1465.56s)]
*  In what way? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1469.28s)]
*  It can be a little tricky to be a young woman in the public eye. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1470.84s)]
*  And I say that having been a much younger woman in the public eye, like I did it, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1477.48s)]
*  you know, when I was, I think, 26, maybe when my first book came out. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1481.48s)]
*  And that's young, in my opinion. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1485.24s)]
*  I think that there's a huge level of visibility that is accorded to young [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1487.6s)]
*  women specifically, and that's something that I grapple with, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1494.8s)]
*  the unfairness of that and and my having benefited from the unfairness of that. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1499.88s)]
*  But also [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1505.24s)]
*  the other side of it, which is the difficulty of hyper visibility, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1507.24s)]
*  it has been difficult for me on a personal level to manage that level of visibility, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1511.64s)]
*  which isn't something that I would have always wished to have. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1516.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think it seems perfectly [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1519.64s)]
*  valid and legible to suggest, as I think you are like, you know, there's [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1523.16s)]
*  obviously beneficial things to being famous and successful and like things [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1527.96s)]
*  about it that are like awful. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, that's you don't need to couch that in any. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1534.48s)]
*  But I didn't say that. You said that just to be clear. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1538.24s)]
*  You're thinking. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1540.56s)]
*  What do you like to do when you're not when you're not writing? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1544.12s)]
*  What do I like to do? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1550.12s)]
*  I mean, I read, obviously, I like to I feel like I'm so uninteresting. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1551.8799999999999s)]
*  This is the problem that I have when I do [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1558.6799999999998s)]
*  interviews is that I feel like beyond talking about my book, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1560.48s)]
*  which I can talk about with some authority. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1564.16s)]
*  Do you think I'm expecting you to say you [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1565.76s)]
*  hellish ski and coming from me would be like, why is that interesting that she [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1569.8s)]
*  does it because I just said, yeah, I'm just on a human level. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1575.04s)]
*  You said I'm not interesting in any way. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1579.48s)]
*  I'm just like a random person. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1581.84s)]
*  And I do all the things you would expect a writer would do. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1583.48s)]
*  Read, watch films, watch TV. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1586.56s)]
*  I feel almost like [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1589.44s)]
*  there's something in me that resists like being humanized. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1594.04s)]
*  Like, at least when I talk about my work, I can kind of I feel I'm holding on to something. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1598.6s)]
*  It's like I've got hold of something. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1602.68s)]
*  And it's like, well, I'm the one who can talk about it because I wrote it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1604.08s)]
*  So I feel like I can stand or rather sit here. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's justified in a way. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1610.0s)]
*  I need this constant self justification to feel that I can sit here and talk to you [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1611.6s)]
*  at all, otherwise I'd be like running away because, you know, it's nerve racking. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1614.92s)]
*  And the only justification I can find is that I've written work that's in the public [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1618.88s)]
*  and you're entitled to grill me about it and I should have to come up with answers. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1622.72s)]
*  And that feels like real. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1626.44s)]
*  And somehow I get a little bit of shifting sands when I start trying to talk [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1628.1200000000001s)]
*  about things that stray from that. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1632.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1633.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1635.16s)]
*  In all your books, the characters, even though [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1636.96s)]
*  the central thrust of the books [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1641.76s)]
*  tends to be relationships between people, the people who are having the relationships [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1646.92s)]
*  are thinking about the biggest questions, you know, like how do we live under capitalism? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1653.28s)]
*  You know, what kind of person do I want to be? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1659.0s)]
*  When it comes to the biggest questions, do you in any way [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  feel that exploring those questions through your work helps you get closer [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1668.0s)]
*  to answers that you find personally satisfying? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1682.7199999999998s)]
*  I had never thought about that, oddly. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1683.76s)]
*  I think that I'm. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1687.6s)]
*  So [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1690.4399999999998s)]
*  committed to being with my characters, that I sense myself as an almost passive [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1693.56s)]
*  observer following their conversations with one another and their interior [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1700.72s)]
*  monologues and their sort of streams of consciousness. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  And I don't sense my own participation in that. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1710.32s)]
*  I'm walking the tightrope of trying to write it down in prose that I don't hate. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1715.32s)]
*  You know, that's kind of my job. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1719.72s)]
*  But of course, there must be some reason why they find themselves drawn to the same [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1721.6000000000001s)]
*  kind of questions that I find myself drawn to philosophically, ideologically, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1728.52s)]
*  interpersonally. So what's the interplay there? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1732.08s)]
*  I mean, I definitely think, yeah, I definitely think there must be some. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1735.52s)]
*  And I think that [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1739.0s)]
*  I find my work [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1741.56s)]
*  very personally fulfilling. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1746.96s)]
*  And when I am writing a project, I am at my happiest. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1749.6s)]
*  And when the writing is going well, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1753.16s)]
*  I feel like I have my dream life and I'm so happy. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1755.68s)]
*  I feel very enriched by what I do. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1761.24s)]
*  And so there must be some level on which it's not just the satisfaction of a good [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1765.72s)]
*  day's hard work done, there's something maybe else going on, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1772.32s)]
*  like what you're talking about, that I'm gaining some insight through the sort [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1775.8s)]
*  of wacky mirror of my characters who don't seem to resemble me at all, or [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1781.2s)]
*  through their philosophical wrangling, I myself am getting closer to answers [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1785.64s)]
*  to questions that I am asking myself. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1791.0s)]
*  So there's definitely a deep relationship [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1794.0800000000002s)]
*  between my work and my sense of being in the world. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1797.8s)]
*  I suspect that there probably for me, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1802.0s)]
*  there probably is something there that I'm learning from my characters in some way [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1803.96s)]
*  or that by making them confront these problems and these difficult questions, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1808.44s)]
*  I'm almost confronting them in a camera obscura sort of way, or I'm allowing myself [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1813.2s)]
*  to experience other lives, lives that I haven't had. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1818.72s)]
*  And I think one of the things that I find haunting or that I find [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1822.1200000000001s)]
*  like difficult to accept that I think maybe a lot of other people do is like [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1828.1200000000001s)]
*  that I only get one life, you know, I'm condemned to just being myself [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1831.8s)]
*  and I have to be me until the end. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1835.44s)]
*  And and I find that so weird to get my head around. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1837.96s)]
*  That's the it. I'm just me. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1842.76s)]
*  And like I can never be anyone else. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1844.68s)]
*  And in a way, being a novelist allows me to get around that problem. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1846.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, my own response to what you were just saying, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1850.52s)]
*  that you find it haunting that you, you know, only get to be you. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1854.16s)]
*  I feel so much of the opposite that when I'm just thinking about it now, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1859.44s)]
*  it actually brings tears to my eyes because it makes me emotional to think [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1863.56s)]
*  and to feel like I get to be me. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1868.52s)]
*  And there's all this like I get to have the kids that I have and have the family [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1871.08s)]
*  and I have and have the friends I have and have the life I have. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1875.0s)]
*  And I just feel like so like the just the sheer gratitude about getting to be who I [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1877.28s)]
*  am existing, given the sheer unlikelihood of that. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1883.68s)]
*  It's like, how could you possibly be haunted by that? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1886.68s)]
*  Yeah. But I think that what you're talking about and what I'm talking about [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1889.68s)]
*  might be closer than you think, because what you're describing, I also feel. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1892.28s)]
*  And especially when I'm in the middle of a project and I close my laptop, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1895.6s)]
*  it's the end of the day and I return to my own life. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1899.48s)]
*  I definitely feel that sense of indescribable gratitude that I am alive on this earth, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1902.76s)]
*  that I know the people who I know, that, you know, my loved ones are part of my life [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1909.0s)]
*  and that I can like look around at trees and that I can experience the sensory [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1913.04s)]
*  reality of the earth that we share. It's unbelievable. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1919.24s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1921.68s)]
*  And that's and that's something that I think my work actually puts me in touch [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1923.4s)]
*  with, because I it's like I go into what feels like another life, another world, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1926.24s)]
*  another mind, another set of problems. Everybody has them. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  And then when I close my laptop, I'm returned to my own life, my own problems, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1935.5600000000002s)]
*  if you will, and my and my own circumstances. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1941.0400000000002s)]
*  And I remember what an what an incredible, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1943.88s)]
*  almost unbelievable gift it is just to exist. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1947.2800000000002s)]
*  After the break, I call Sally back to talk about the TV adaptations of her first two [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1951.76s)]
*  books and why she's not planning on doing another one anytime soon. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1962.76s)]
*  You know, I was seeing, for instance, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1967.0800000000002s)]
*  the extent to which the young cast members became, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1968.68s)]
*  you know, were really thrust into an extremely harsh spotlight and had [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1972.8000000000002s)]
*  paparazzi following them around. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1977.6399999999999s)]
*  And I felt kind of uncomfortable with the level of frenzy. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1979.1599999999999s)]
*  Hi, Sally. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1996.52s)]
*  Hello. Hi. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1997.36s)]
*  You know, there was one subject you raised earlier where, you know, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=1999.9199999999998s)]
*  I realized I was nodding along when you were talking about it, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2004.16s)]
*  but only really understood what you meant in a very general fashion. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2007.72s)]
*  You had said, you know, it can be difficult to be a young woman in the public eye. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2012.6000000000001s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit more specifically about that experience that felt difficult? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2016.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and it's difficult for me to talk about specifically because [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel very inhibited by a lot of different pressures. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2028.0400000000002s)]
*  And one of those pressures is that I am extremely conscious of [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2032.0s)]
*  my extraordinary good fortune in so many ways. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2037.68s)]
*  So like the fact that my books [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2041.28s)]
*  have been so widely read and discussed, that's an enormous privilege. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2044.8s)]
*  Lots of writers don't get it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2048.6s)]
*  And perhaps that has to do in some sense with the fact of my youth or even of being [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2050.24s)]
*  a young woman. So I find that like a tough question to answer. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2055.24s)]
*  It's like I want to be able to gesture to it very vaguely and for everybody to go, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2058.48s)]
*  oh, of course, we know what you're talking about without me having to say, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2061.48s)]
*  and then this happened and then this happened, you know, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2064.2s)]
*  and that was so hard for me personally. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2066.32s)]
*  I suppose, again, to occupy the more abstract general position, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2068.48s)]
*  I think that the role [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2073.2400000000002s)]
*  afforded to young women in the culture at large generally tends to be a very [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2078.2s)]
*  visible role and very image focused and less intellectual. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2083.2400000000002s)]
*  And of course, the young women who are given the most prominent roles in our [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2090.0s)]
*  mainstream culture tend to be [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2094.8s)]
*  sort of not political figures and not public intellectuals and not critics [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2098.88s)]
*  or commentators, more likely singers, actors and people whose image is a huge part [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2105.6000000000004s)]
*  of their presentation. And then so for me to feel like I'm trying to, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2112.28s)]
*  that's maybe the space that I'm trying to work within. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2116.72s)]
*  And sometimes I feel that maybe I'm not legible within that space. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2120.56s)]
*  And so it's I sometimes feel people want to read me as something closer to [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2124.3199999999997s)]
*  a kind of [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  celebrity figure, because that's maybe the way in which we're used to reading [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2133.52s)]
*  the image of a young woman in our culture. And it's, yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2138.24s)]
*  So, but again, that's like, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2141.56s)]
*  I recognize as well how lucky I am to be in a position where anyone's listening to [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  anything I say at all. But there is that slight tension, I think, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2148.04s)]
*  for me in trying to assert or occupy a particular position in the culture [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2151.64s)]
*  and feeling like maybe it's difficult to make room for myself there, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2158.36s)]
*  if that makes sense. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2162.4s)]
*  It does make sense. It does make sense. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2163.44s)]
*  I want to ask also about the adaptations of your work. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2166.72s)]
*  I think the general consensus was that [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2171.48s)]
*  the conversations with friends adaptation was not quite as strong as the normal [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  people adaptation, and you weren't quite as involved in that one. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2179.0800000000004s)]
*  Do you wish you'd been more involved? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2183.48s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2186.28s)]
*  I think that the reason that I chose [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2187.8s)]
*  not to be so involved in the second adaptation was because I was [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2191.56s)]
*  working on what became my third novel. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2200.0s)]
*  And I also felt that the experience of working on the first one had been, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2203.28s)]
*  like in so many ways, amazing. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2209.76s)]
*  The team of people involved in it, you know, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2212.96s)]
*  but it did also feel like a lot, like a really big job. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2215.6000000000004s)]
*  And then also, of course, when the show was broadcast, that felt like a lot [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2219.44s)]
*  in terms of the amount of discourse that it generated and the amount of media [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2224.1200000000003s)]
*  attention that followed on that. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2227.12s)]
*  And I felt that that world was not where I belonged. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2229.0s)]
*  So I was very happy to allow that team to kind of make something new of the book [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2232.88s)]
*  without me needing to be looking over their shoulder. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2239.68s)]
*  And I think that's what they did. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2242.04s)]
*  So, yeah, I think for me, I see myself so strongly as a novelist. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2243.4s)]
*  And in a way, it was great to have the experience of working on a television show. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2247.52s)]
*  But it was also a kind of an interesting lesson for me in that I felt like, OK, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2251.48s)]
*  now I know that my books are where I belong and that's all that I want to be doing. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2254.88s)]
*  And does it feel at all difficult to, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2261.7200000000003s)]
*  in a sense, give control up of your stories to other creators? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  No, it kind of felt like my book is still just its own thing. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2271.6s)]
*  So that felt OK to me. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2275.04s)]
*  But also, as I said, the level of [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2277.04s)]
*  attention and public discourse that's attendant on the world of film and [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2281.3599999999997s)]
*  television felt quite alien to me and it felt like the, you know, I was seeing, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2286.56s)]
*  for instance, the extent to which the young cast members became, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2292.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, were really thrust into an extremely harsh spotlight and had [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2296.96s)]
*  paparazzi following them around, and that felt like, oh, my God, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2301.96s)]
*  my intervention in the culture has resulted in something that I'm really [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2306.16s)]
*  uncomfortable with, like a kind of real invasion of the lives of young people who [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2309.2s)]
*  are absolutely hugely talented and gifted professionals, but also just human beings. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2314.4399999999996s)]
*  And it felt like I felt kind of [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2319.16s)]
*  uncomfortable with the level of frenzy around the, yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2322.12s)]
*  It's like a Frankenstein's monster situation. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2327.12s)]
*  Right, with the attention, not obviously with the people. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2329.2s)]
*  But yeah, of course, I did kind of feel I felt uncomfortable with that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2331.7999999999997s)]
*  And although I wasn't on the receiving end of that level of crazed attention, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2334.84s)]
*  I certainly felt like I was getting a little fraction of it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2340.48s)]
*  And even that was like way too much for me. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2343.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Is anybody working on adapting Beautiful World? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2345.32s)]
*  Where are you? No. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2348.92s)]
*  So I decided not to accept any. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2349.8s)]
*  So far, I have decided not to accept any [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2354.36s)]
*  offers to to option the rights for that book. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2356.44s)]
*  For reasons related to what you were just saying, or why is that? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2360.2400000000002s)]
*  For exactly the reasons that we've just been talking about. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2363.12s)]
*  And I think, yeah, I think I think it's I felt like it was just time to take a [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2365.6s)]
*  break from that and let the book kind of be its own thing for a while. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2372.64s)]
*  I have one last question. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2377.64s)]
*  Maybe it's too big of a question to end on, but I think I think it relates to a [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2379.68s)]
*  recurring theme in your work, you know, how one might live a meaningful life [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2385.28s)]
*  in a time of historical crisis. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2391.4399999999996s)]
*  How do we make our time here mean something? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2394.6s)]
*  You know, how do we give it give it value? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2397.2s)]
*  How do you think about the value of your work in that regard? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2399.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a really good question and a really difficult [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2404.64s)]
*  questions and certainly one that I constantly return to in my own life. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2408.4399999999996s)]
*  And also, I think in my work directly and indirectly, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2414.3999999999996s)]
*  I feel absolutely convinced that our present, you know, world system [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2418.64s)]
*  is not fit for purpose. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2426.8s)]
*  I think the rate at which we're destroying [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2429.08s)]
*  our planetary ecosystems is obviously completely unsustainable. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2432.12s)]
*  And I mean, we have physicists telling us this. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2437.4s)]
*  We kind of know that there is no way that we can continue living the lifestyles we [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2440.52s)]
*  live under the economic systems that we have designed and that we continue to [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2446.0s)]
*  propagate. That's a kind of crisis that is extremely pressing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2450.28s)]
*  And of course, I'm aware that I've spent three years of my life working on a novel [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2456.92s)]
*  that does not really directly contribute anything to the struggle against [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2462.8s)]
*  these forces. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2471.52s)]
*  And of course, I do absolutely question why I've done that. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2473.12s)]
*  Partly, I think because [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2478.6800000000003s)]
*  I didn't know what else to do. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2481.88s)]
*  Also, I suppose I tell myself that [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2484.1600000000003s)]
*  in the midst of all of this, people need to feel that life has meaning, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2488.08s)]
*  like not to become so incredibly overwhelmed by the enormity of the problems [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2495.16s)]
*  that we're facing as to feel that life itself is no longer meaningful and that, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2501.24s)]
*  in fact, there's no reason to go on. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2505.72s)]
*  And I don't think that that actually is a very uncommon feeling. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2507.64s)]
*  And I suppose part of what I feel is that art has a role in giving people a reason [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2510.8399999999997s)]
*  to go on and that that is an important thing in and of itself. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2515.52s)]
*  It's like it's [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2518.96s)]
*  it's consolation for people who are involved in the struggle in some way. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2520.56s)]
*  But that's a very self-justifying answer because I don't know if that's true. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2526.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know is the answer to the question. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2533.44s)]
*  But I suppose that I do feel that the work of art has an autonomy from the world of [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2537.52s)]
*  political urgency. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2547.08s)]
*  It's not that I think that art is in any way sealed off from ideological concerns, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2549.08s)]
*  but that it can't be expected to solve political crises and that it has to be [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2554.04s)]
*  allowed to exist anyway, kind of even if it's not good, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2560.2799999999997s)]
*  because I feel like a lot of this would be more easy to justify if I could say, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2563.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, and thankfully all my novels are works of genius. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2568.0s)]
*  But what I will say is they're completely sincere. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2571.7999999999997s)]
*  If they're bad, then they're sincerely bad. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2574.08s)]
*  Like I genuinely put my heart and soul into them and that's the best I could do. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2576.28s)]
*  And I had to write them. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2580.4s)]
*  I felt like I didn't have any choice. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2581.76s)]
*  But and also it sounds like you get real pleasure from doing the work. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2584.44s)]
*  And I feel confident in saying that [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2589.96s)]
*  there are people who get pleasure from reading the work. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2594.0s)]
*  And that that's not nothing. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2596.48s)]
*  Well, thank you. And it's not nothing. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2598.0s)]
*  Certainly not to me. It's kind of everything. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM&t=2600.0s)]
