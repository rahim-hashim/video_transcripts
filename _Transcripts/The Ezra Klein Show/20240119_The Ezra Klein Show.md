# Thomas Friedman Takes Stock of The Israel-Hamas War
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j18YCnFp2W8)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So before we begin today, a bit of housekeeping.
*  We are hiring a column assistant for me and Tracy McMillan Cottom, who's going to do fact
*  checking, research, clerical work.
*  It's a great entry level job at The Times.
*  And you can find it by going to nytco.com slash careers, or we will have a link to it
*  in the show notes.
*  So it has been a bit more than 100 days since October 7th, a bit more than 100 days since
*  Hamas attacked Israel.
*  It has been almost 90 days since Israel began its ground invasion of Gaza.
*  Since then, the Gaza Ministry of Health says more than 24,000 Gazans have died.
*  More than 60,000 have been injured.
*  About 10,000 of the dead are under age 18.
*  I know some object to using numbers from the Gaza Ministry of Health.
*  They say, well, that's Hamas.
*  I think that's complicated.
*  I think those numbers have broadly been viewed to be reasonable.
*  But here's, if you don't trust them, another way of thinking about it.
*  There was a recent poll, independent, that asked Gazans if any member of their family
*  had been killed or injured since the attacks.
*  And 64% said yes.
*  They had 64% of Gazans in this poll said a member of their family had been killed or
*  injured.
*  We know nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced from their homes.
*  That's in a population that has only been above 2 million in total.
*  And for many, there are no homes to go back to.
*  An analysis of satellite imagery by two researchers estimated that about half of all buildings
*  in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged.
*  A Washington Post analysis separately concluded, quote, the evidence shows that Israel has
*  carried out its war in Gaza at a pace and level of devastation that likely exceeds any
*  recent conflict.
*  And to what end?
*  Is Hamas gone?
*  Is Israel safer?
*  Israel believes over 100 hostages still remain in Gaza.
*  No military expert I know of believes Hamas to be destroyed or on the verge of destruction.
*  Everything shows Hamas is more popular in Gaza and the West Bank than it was before
*  the attack.
*  The Palestinian Authority, the more moderate Palestinian governance faction that controls
*  the West Bank, has seen what support it had collapsed.
*  There is no plan anywhere that anyone knows of for the so-called day after Gaza.
*  No sense of who will govern it or how, only that Israel will maintain control for who
*  knows how long in it, who knows what cost.
*  And the cost in how Israel is seen around the world has been massive.
*  The morning consult pulled 43 countries and found favorability towards Israel had dropped
*  in 42 of them.
*  The average drop was almost 20 points.
*  And in China, in South Africa, in Brazil, Israel has gone from being seen positively
*  to being seen negatively.
*  And South Africa has brought charges of genocide against Israel at the UN.
*  And then of course, there are all the other threats that linger.
*  The threat that this war could expand into something much bigger in the region now or
*  others see Israel's weakness and the strain between it and other players and countries
*  and allies as an opportunity.
*  In my first commentary after Hamas's attacks, I said, and I was only one of many who said
*  this, that Hamas knew that to attack inside Israel at the scale it did, with the barbarity
*  it did, would elicit an overwhelming military response.
*  Absolute destruction would rain down on Gaza.
*  And so it was necessary to ask then, why would they want that?
*  What would it mean if Israel gave them what they seemed to want?
*  What would it mean if Israel didn't give them what they seemed to want?
*  But Israel gave them what they seemed to want.
*  And so I think it is time now to return to those early questions in light of what we
*  now know.
*  And I wanted to do so with a colleague who knows a region much better than I do, who
*  has far more authority among policymakers there than almost anyone else.
*  And who has been a consistent and clear voice for restraint here, a wise voice, I think.
*  Tom Friedman is the author of From Beirut to Jerusalem, which won the National Book
*  Award in 1989.
*  He's won three Pulitzers, including one for his reporting from Israel.
*  And so I wanted to understand, given all he's seen and everybody he knows, how the war and
*  the region look to him now.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
*  Tom Friedman, welcome to the show.
*  Great to be with you, Ezra.
*  Let's begin here.
*  What has life in Gaza become?
*  Life in Gaza has become Habezi, nasty, brutish and short for 85% of the population has been
*  dislocated.
*  Many of them have lost their homes entirely.
*  And we're talking about a relatively young population.
*  So when 2000 pound bombs, dumb bombs land there, it kills an inordinate large number
*  of children.
*  It has been hellish because Israel is fighting an enemy that has deliberately created an
*  underground network that is almost incomprehensible in its scope to fight Israel.
*  That means the only way you can get at this enemy is basically by going through the homes
*  and buildings and offices on top of that ground.
*  And Israel's done that in a way that I think a lot of experts would say has been way too
*  casual about civilian losses.
*  If you compare it to other such situations like Raqqa and Mosul, where we were fighting
*  ISIS, all of that said, one must never lose sight of the fact that Hamas started this
*  war knowing from much experience what the Israeli response would do.
*  And it provided not one underground shelter for a single civilian in Gaza.
*  Early on, a Hamas spokesman said, that's not our job.
*  The tunnels are for Hamas.
*  It's the UN's job to protect the civilians.
*  There's this poll that sits in my gut that found 64% of Gazans said a member of their
*  family had been killed or injured during the current war in Gaza.
*  And one thing inside of that is when you ask what does Hamas run on, it runs on people.
*  And it runs on people's desire for revenge, people's desire, Palestinians desire to destroy
*  Israel, and probably on an individual level to regain dignity and agency and autonomy
*  for themselves.
*  I wonder when I read that, not just about the amount of grief there, but about what
*  that grief can be turned into.
*  I think you're asking a really important question.
*  The consequences of this war on both sides will be vast.
*  And I don't know what the right proportionality is for killing civilians inadvertently as
*  part of pursuing this kind of war.
*  But I feel in my own gut.
*  And I certainly believe the world believes Israel's well past that proportionality.
*  We shouldn't be at the stage we're at right now, Israel, 100 days into this war.
*  And you can't tell me and I can't tell you what Israel's political objective is for the
*  morning after.
*  Are we heading for a situation where 7 million Jews are going to permanently control 3 million
*  Palestinians in the West Bank and 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza?
*  If that's where we're going, that's a disaster.
*  I believe that the attack on October 7th, as awful as it was, was not existential.
*  It was not an existential threat to the state of Israel.
*  It was awful.
*  I believe Israel permanently stuck in Gaza.
*  Oh, that's an existential threat in the world we're living in.
*  That is something that could really begin to unravel the state because I think the pressure
*  on the West Bank then would grow.
*  We already see that growing every day.
*  And the pressure from the neighborhood would grow because it would legitimize what the
*  Houthis are doing, what Hezbollah is doing, what Turkey is doing in ways that I think
*  would be very dangerous for Israel.
*  One thing that you've been worried about and have written quite a bit about is the possibility
*  this could blow up into a wider war.
*  And we keep seeing small things, you know, rockets from Hezbollah, that kind of thing.
*  Tell me what you fear there and what would be the signs that it might be happening.
*  Israel today faces a strategic dilemma that no other country faces in the world.
*  It is fighting non-state actors on four different fronts, Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, and Islamic
*  militias, Shia militias in Iraq, who've actually launched stuff at Israel too.
*  This is worth a show of its own, how we've entered a world where smaller and smaller
*  units now can amass greater and greater power.
*  We now have four of them going on around Israel.
*  The Houthis, who are living in the middle of a completely failed state that may be the
*  first country in the world to run out of water, these are basically tribesmen that are firing
*  cruise missiles at international ships that are forcing them now to no longer go through
*  the Suez Canal but around the Cape of Good Hope and are raising insurance rates for shipping
*  all over the world.
*  The Houthis actually are contributing to inflation all over the world.
*  This small group of tribesmen in Yemen, they are in a way super empowered.
*  Israel's surrounded by four of them.
*  So what I fear is that a Hezbollah-Israel war, Israel would be like none other.
*  They fought a war in 2006, but at the time, Hezbollah only had dumb rockets.
*  So if you had to shoot 50 rockets at a target, and maybe one or two would hit, and they were
*  vulnerable to Iron Dome.
*  But much more serious, Hezbollah now has hundreds, maybe thousands of precision rockets where
*  you fire one and it lands within a 5 or 10 or 15 meter radius of whatever the target
*  is.
*  If it start firing those at every military air base in northern Israel, at Israel's Defense
*  Ministry, at Lod Airport, at Haifa Port, God forbid at the Demona nuclear reactor, it could
*  cripple the Israeli economy.
*  Now Israel in response would cripple Lebanon as if it already isn't crippled enough, but
*  we're talking about something that could devastate the Israeli economy and possibly
*  then lead to an Iran-Israel rocket war.
*  And then you're talking about something that is a fundamental threat to Israel that would
*  certainly draw the United States in.
*  Russia and Iran have become very close.
*  Iran's now providing drones for Russia and Ukraine, and you could be into a real world
*  war.
*  So I found it really hard to stop thinking about the counterfactuals here, about the
*  different kinds of world we could be inhabiting right now.
*  And one counterfactual that has sat in my head is one you offered in a column very early
*  on.
*  This was in late October.
*  And you talked about how India chose to respond to the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
*  So could you talk about that?
*  India's prime minister at the time, Manmohan Singh, what did he do?
*  He did nothing.
*  He basically decided that if he was going to retaliate against Pakistan for the attack
*  in Mumbai that was perpetrated by Pakistani Islamist group, really quite similar to Hamas,
*  that what it would do would reduce the impact.
*  And people would just then treat the whole thing as another tit for tat between Pakistan
*  and India and actually lose sight of how vile and how grave the incident was.
*  And to refresh my memory, Ezra, I went back and reread specifically about why they chose
*  not to retaliate.
*  And Ezra, everything warned about in the India context has played out between Israel and
*  Hamas.
*  From where we're sitting now, would Israel have been better off if it had done as politically
*  unthinkable as it was then?
*  Nothing.
*  That it had contained what it did to more covert operations?
*  In the public eye, at least, it did not engage in a full out, reprisal, leveling of Gaza,
*  ground invasion.
*  Several people have asked me that and I've asked myself that question.
*  And everything I wrote at the time, Ezra was written with just incredible humility and
*  awareness that there are huge trade-offs here.
*  When a country like Israel gets this vile of an attack, that was really designed to
*  trigger the kind of massive response that Hamas wanted.
*  Imagine America on 9-11 lost 20 million people so that every American knew someone or knew
*  someone who knew someone who died on 9-11.
*  The act of self-restraint would have been enormous.
*  And I realized that.
*  I was very aware that the debate in Israel was completely one-dimensional.
*  And a little bit of what I was trying to do is just a little kind of red team, you know,
*  Team B. I don't know if this is right, but have you thought of this?
*  Because what if you just said, we're going to make this operation rescue grandma?
*  That you focused entirely on getting back the hostages, first and foremost, and on what
*  Hamas did and elevated to the world, enabled the world to understand what a unprecedented
*  attack this was by Hamas on not the occupied territory, but pre-67 Israel, the most liberal
*  part of Israel, the border Kibbutzim, where they abducted infants and they abducted grandparents.
*  They killed parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents, engaged
*  in awful sexual predation.
*  And had you done that, you actually would have gone a long way to delegitimizing Hamas.
*  I think there would have been a real revulsion by many Palestinians, by many Arabs.
*  And I think it could have put Hamas in a position where it had to give back those hostages.
*  And even if it was in trade for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, Hamas would have
*  been branded as ISIS.
*  And that would have been for Hamas a very dangerous thing.
*  And the reason I said that, Ezra, at the time, because there were two little stories
*  I noticed within 36 hours of the attack.
*  One was a Hamas official who came out from some underground, a spokesman, and said, we
*  only attack soldiers.
*  And the other was that they released a picture of Hamas giving water to a young hostage,
*  I believe.
*  And that told me Hamas knew they were in trouble.
*  Whether it was exactly designed to this or it got completely out of control, whatever
*  happened, they knew that they were in trouble.
*  And unfortunately, Israel kind of took them off the hook.
*  It may not have been a conscious decision by Sinwar, the Hamas leader, but I believe
*  he certainly understood the benefits of it, that he has been trading the lives of Gazan
*  civilians for one of the greatest public relation coups by any Palestinian against
*  any Israeli government, getting Israel delegitimized on the world stage and hauled before the International
*  Court of Justice.
*  I think it's a shameful trade-off, but I think we'd be very naive not to think that he isn't
*  enjoying that.
*  When I see Israel debating South Africa at the UN over whether what they're conducting
*  in Gaza is a genocide, I think to myself, Israel's not winning.
*  Exactly.
*  And when I look at South Africa and I say, look, you hauled Israel before the International
*  Court of Justice for what it's done in Gaza against Gazan civilians, that's a very legitimate
*  issue I think to be raising right now.
*  When I see you do that, and you South Africa have not said one word about Russia's, I don't
*  know if it's genocide, but it certainly rhymes with it in Ukraine, to actually wipe out the
*  identity of another country, to wipe out the identity and people of another country.
*  And using rape and kidnapping of children, when you ignore that and you only focus on
*  the first, then I think the moral impact of what you're doing is diluted for Israelis,
*  for a lot of Jews, and for a lot of, I think, fair-minded people.
*  But doesn't that attend to the United States as well?
*  And I want to say, I agree with you on what you're saying there about South Africa.
*  One of the deep injuries that Israelis carry around is a feeling that their country is
*  held to a higher standard in the international community by other countries than anyone else.
*  But if you take American support, America's been quick and correct to condemn Russia,
*  to support Ukraine, to call what Russia is doing war crimes.
*  And it's sometimes hard for me as somebody who's fundamentally sympathetic to Israel,
*  and who believes that America should support Israel in areas of legitimate self-defense,
*  to look at what has been done in Gaza and see something that we should still be supporting.
*  I mean, I mentioned that poll about how many Gazans have lost a family member.
*  But here's another.
*  There was this analysis of satellite data by two researchers, found about half of all
*  structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.
*  It is very, very hard for me to believe.
*  And I've heard nothing from the Israeli side that makes me believe it, that that was necessary
*  to stop Hamas or make Israel safer, as opposed to a kind of collective punishment that we
*  would condemn elsewhere, and properly so.
*  So now that I share your view, but thousands of casualties ago, I did a column called Time
*  for some Tough Love by Biden to Israel on exactly this issue, urging the US to support
*  a ceasefire and return for the hostages and get out of Gaza and let's get NATO and American
*  troops on the border.
*  But this has to stop.
*  It has to stop because it is unjust.
*  It's horrific.
*  And it's going to, besides devastate Palestinians, it's going to be a stain on Israel that it
*  will regret, I think, one day.
*  You've been arguing in your columns from the beginning of this to do less.
*  I'm sure you have a lot of voices there trying to convince you that you've gone soft, that
*  you're missing the real picture.
*  What's the argument they make to you that what Israel is doing now is making it safer?
*  And also that this idea that you're going to destroy Hamas, that's not really an achievable
*  goal.
*  To level Gaza behind that theory is to send yourself on a mission you cannot complete.
*  And yet they are doing something like that.
*  So what is the best argument you hear from them that this is the right thing for Israel's
*  security, the trade-off here in terms of world opinion, in terms of grieving and revenge
*  inflected Gazans, that the security that they're getting from doing this is worth it?
*  Give me the best argument you've heard.
*  The best argument is exactly the one you've made, to which I have pushed back that I think
*  is a realistic objective, particularly if you have no endgame in mind that will create
*  a stable structure in Gaza that won't involve permanent Israeli control.
*  Because that kind of attack that you just described, that kind of retaliation, Ezra,
*  absent that kind of morning after political structure, that just looks like revenge.
*  We need a legitimate Palestinian political structure that can partner with Israel in
*  governing the West Bank and Gaza in the context of a broader political horizon of how to
*  end this conflict and engineer two states for two people.
*  And the fact that Israel at the leadership level is canceling cabinet meetings to discuss
*  it, that they can't even discuss that, is terrifying to me.
*  I was just reading a story in Haaretz before we sat down to talk about a split in Israel's
*  war cabinet between Yahu and the defense minister, Gallant, who want to continue the operation
*  until they've, quote unquote, destroyed Hamas and Benny Gantz and some of the others in
*  his faction who are arguing, it's time to get the hostages back.
*  There are deals we can cut.
*  We can be more creative about this.
*  There's already been talk on Egypt's and Qatar's part of a sort of full hostage exchange for
*  something that leads to a full ceasefire.
*  And Netanyahu has basically said, no, clearly Gantz wants to explore something in that realm.
*  And so I'm curious how you see the split at the top levels now of Israeli politics, but
*  specifically the incentives of Netanyahu.
*  This is a kind of strange war where Yahu Sinoir thinks if he's standing at the end of this
*  thing, he wins no matter how many Gazan civilians have paid the price.
*  Netanyahu, I would argue, Ezra doesn't want to win.
*  He wants to be winning.
*  That is, he wants to be able to say, we're winning, we're winning, we're winning.
*  It's just around the corner, but he doesn't want to actually win because if the war actually
*  ends, two things are going to happen.
*  Then he can no longer avoid what is the new political end state.
*  And I believe there will be an eruption, a massive eruption of Israeli anger at him that
*  I hope and pray will drive him from power because I believe he is not only the worst
*  leader in Israel's history, I believe he's the worst leader in Jewish history.
*  And that's a long history.
*  And what is Netanyahu's calculation is very simple.
*  If he is not in power and has to face the conclusion of his trial and three corruption
*  charges without the protection and influence that comes over the judiciary from being in
*  power, he has a very good chance of going to jail.
*  People forget Israel jailed a president and a former prime minister.
*  They're not afraid to do that.
*  And he does not want to go to jail.
*  And he does not want to give up power.
*  And so this is a terrible situation where Israel is in an existential war and its prime
*  minister has basically dual loyalties, one to the state and one to himself.
*  And at every turn, he is prioritizing himself.
*  And so that's what's worried me before.
*  It's worrying me now.
*  And it worries me about Joe Biden because Biden keeps telling him, stop killing so many
*  civilians.
*  And he said, yes, absolutely, sir, we're going to do that.
*  And they keep killing more civilians.
*  There's a lot I want to come back to there and we will.
*  But I want to spend a moment on Benny Gantz, who I think is a name known now, but not a
*  figure well known.
*  When I talk to Israelis who are center left or centrist, their only faith in the war cabinet
*  is that the Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot and some others around them have influence.
*  But who is Benny Gantz?
*  How would you describe him?
*  This is an imperfect analogy.
*  But in terms of the political spectrum, think Joe Manchin.
*  Center right, but from the left side.
*  I don't know if I'm...
*  He comes to the center right, but he comes to it through the left, not from the right.
*  No, that's a good way of putting Joe Manchin.
*  That's actually quite helpful for me.
*  Yeah.
*  So Joe Manchin, but former chief of staff of the army.
*  And part of a long tradition in Israeli politics are former generals going into politics and
*  becoming kind of unifying centrists, basically.
*  So that's kind of the general perspective he comes from.
*  A good man in my view, a very decent man.
*  His partner in leadership, Gadi Eizenkot, is probably the most respected former chief
*  of staff of the Israeli army alive today.
*  He's already lost his son and his nephew in this war.
*  He was literally sitting in the command headquarters when he was informed that his son was killed.
*  And so the two of them are admired by both the military and the public and widely respected.
*  But Benny is not a man for, okay, we're going to go from this war to a two-state solution.
*  I talked to him about this at length when I was last in Israel a few weeks ago.
*  I think he sees it going from where we are now to two entities.
*  And maybe those two entities can then evolve into two states.
*  So he's not a radical, but he's certainly someone who will be prepared to talk about
*  the morning after and in the context of some kind of political endgame for the Palestinians
*  that involves two states for two people.
*  So if Benny Gantz wins the next election in Israel and called you to get your advice,
*  what would you tell him?
*  The necessary but not sufficient condition for Israel to have a secure Gaza and have
*  a coalition in the Middle East that can push back on Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis,
*  and Shaitan militias in Iraq, the necessary but not sufficient condition is that you have
*  a credible, legitimate, legitimate from a Palestinian point of view, Palestinian partner
*  that can govern the West Bank and Gaza.
*  And it is a vital Israeli national security interest that you work to nurture that partner,
*  that you try to enlist America and European and Arab help to do that.
*  You want to know what was the most disturbing story I read in the paper in the last three
*  days?
*  It was that America assembled a coalition to fire back at the Houthis to deter them.
*  Do you know how many people were in that coalition?
*  Us and the Brits.
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, folks.
*  A tribe in Yemen has disrupted international shipping so much that the Suez Canal is practically
*  empty and ships have to go around the Cape of Good Hope.
*  having to pay more, insurance is paying more, and how many people could we muster?
*  There were others supposedly involved, but basically it was only the Brits.
*  What am I saying?
*  I'm saying that if Israel doesn't create a context where it has a legitimate Palestinian
*  partner for the future, it can't build the regional coalition it needs not just to deal
*  with Gaza, but to deal with the much wider regional threat it faces.
*  And now this seems to be something in a weird way that Palestinians and Israelis agree on
*  and Americans and you do not, which is that the Palestinian Authority should not be in
*  charge of Gaza or anything else after this war.
*  I mean Netanyahu has been very clear about this and they don't have credibility when
*  you look at Palestinian polling.
*  I think you still think that there is some hope for creating a strong enough Palestinian
*  Authority that that is the future of Palestinian governance.
*  So tell me how you see that playing out.
*  What would make that possible?
*  When Israel does a real investigation of this whole October 7th moment and goes back, one
*  of the most damning things that will be said about Netanyahu was that he deliberately pursued
*  a policy of strengthening Hamas in Gaza, weakening Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority in
*  the West Bank to ensure that there would never be a unified Palestinian decision maker and
*  that he could always go to every American president, secretary of state, what do you
*  want from me?
*  The Palestinians are divided.
*  But it's worse than that, Ezra, because the Palestinian Authority has been keeping the
*  lid on in the West Bank by cooperating, some would say collaborating with the Shin Bet
*  and the Israeli military 24-7, 365 days.
*  Netanyahu knows there would be so many more Israelis dead today, but for the cooperation
*  of the Palestinian Authority.
*  And yet knowing that, every chance he got to publicly discuss Abu Mazen and the PA,
*  He used it to denigrate them.
*  He used it to delegitimize them.
*  This was all driven by a political agenda to make sure that there was no credible Palestinian
*  authority.
*  And I believe what has to happen out of this is that the PLO, which is still the sole legitimate
*  representative of the Palestinian people, needs to convene.
*  It needs to appoint a Palestinian government of technocrats and experts that will run Gaza
*  in partnership with the PA and with the understanding and a date certain that there will be elections
*  in two years for a new Palestinian Authority leadership that would govern Gaza and the
*  West Bank.
*  And now, if I haven't pissed off people enough, let me add one more thing.
*  Any Hamas person who renounces violence and embraces Oslo should be allowed to run in
*  that election.
*  Hamas is part of the political movement and culture of Palestinians.
*  And to try to exclude them would only be to perpetuate this crisis.
*  It would be like saying to Israel, you can have an election, but no right-wing parties
*  can run.
*  Because we Americans find them vile.
*  Not going to happen.
*  And what we need is a broad, legitimate Palestinian authority that encompasses political Islam.
*  It doesn't have to be Hamas.
*  I'm not making any case for them.
*  But encompasses the political Islam segment of Palestinian politics.
*  Otherwise it won't be legitimate.
*  It's not only a vital interest to have that partner to deal with Gaza and the regional
*  threat.
*  It's a huge opportunity.
*  Because something very big has also happened in the region.
*  We've talked a lot about the voices that have been shouting.
*  But the fact is, one of the biggest structural changes in the region since 1979 is that Saudi
*  Arabia is legitimately talking about normalizing relations with Israel.
*  The benefits to Israel of that, both diplomatic, political, economic, cultural, societal, are
*  profound.
*  And you not only need a legitimate, credible Palestinian partner to secure Gaza, build
*  a regional alliance against these non-state actors and Iran.
*  But you need it to reap what is one of the most potentially important opportunities for
*  Israel since, not just since Cantabit, but since its founding.
*  So I say that knowing it will be hugely hard.
*  But I say it pretty convinced you will have many Arabs, many Palestinians, many Americans
*  and many Europeans ready to help you.
*  And I say it knowing that if you announce that's your intention, people in Tehran will
*  be very, very sad.
*  So one thing we see in the polling that has been done of Palestinians since the attacks
*  is that Hamas's legitimacy has gone up.
*  Much more in the West Bank than in Gaza, but it's gone up and the Palestinian authorities
*  legitimacy has completely collapsed.
*  How do you read that?
*  I think there's sort of three important elements of that.
*  The first is, it's Palestinians in the West Bank are always, and we've seen this in past
*  conflicts, they are full of anger at the occupation they're living under.
*  And when they see someone taking action, they support it, even if it's this kind of vile
*  kind of action that Hamas did on October 7th.
*  It's also a huge vote of no confidence in their own corrupt and feckless leadership.
*  And so that part of this poll, Ezra, didn't surprise me at all.
*  The part that I thought was most revealing was the fact that support for Hamas in Gaza
*  went up just very marginally.
*  That was Gazans, I think, saying what they will say when this war is over, when Yahya
*  Sinwar actually has to come out of his tunnel if he survives and face his own people, two
*  things will happen.
*  On the morning after he comes out, he will be carried on people's shoulders around Gaza
*  as a hero who held off the Jews for 100 days and inflicted a huge military and political
*  and public relations defeat on them.
*  I think the morning after the morning after, there are many Gazans who will say to him
*  one way or another, what the hell were you thinking?
*  I've lost my family, my house is on the ground.
*  Like what were you thinking?
*  The real truth is these people were under an Israeli occupation and a Hamas occupation.
*  There were two episodes in Gaza, one in 2019 and one in 2023, which I think we may in time
*  discover was also part of the timing of this.
*  A movement of Gazans, an Arabic called Bid'n al-Naish, we want to live.
*  Think about the name of that movement.
*  We want to live.
*  There's a whole website that was devoted to giving Gazans the opportunity to actually
*  call in, this was before October 7th, and talk about their complaints of living under
*  a Hamas tyranny.
*  This was a case of incredible misrule by people who, as I've said, Bibi, what's your plan
*  for the morning after?
*  What was their plan?
*  What was the new steady state that they thought was going to come as a result of this war
*  that would be better for the Palestinian people?
*  So there's been a huge asymmetry here from the very beginning where every action Israel
*  does, it gets questioned rightly by the Israeli press and by the world press and by world
*  diplomats.
*  Israel's been hauled before the International Court of Justice.
*  Yahya Sinwar has not been required to answer a single question.
*  When I think about the steady state, Hamas seems to have been targeting here.
*  And I think that to say they were targeting anything might be giving them more credit
*  than they deserve.
*  But when I've read things making the case for them, when I've spoken to people who are
*  more sympathetic to them, I would say the most common thing I hear is that the Palestinians
*  had become invisible and Hamas made them visible again.
*  That there were these deals being made across the Middle East, normalization with the Saudis
*  and Israel.
*  There had become a whole theory that you could just move on from this.
*  And that what Hamas did was break that steady state.
*  The thing I found most disturbing in that poll was the huge majority of Palestinians
*  who said Hamas was right to launch the 10-7 attacks.
*  Now, who knows what the reporting is and what they know about what was done that day or
*  what they don't know about what was done that day.
*  But overwhelmingly believe Hamas is right to do it, even with all that has happened
*  afterwards.
*  And the thing that I keep hearing is that the Palestinians were being turned invisible
*  and now they are visible and that that for them is a victory.
*  Well first of all, I would say that there are no two national movements in the history
*  of national movements who have had more visibility on the world stage than the Zionist national
*  movement and the Palestinian national movement.
*  What would the Kurds, Ezra, give for one day of publicity that Palestinians have had or
*  normally get, or Israelis for that matter?
*  What would Yazidis give for that?
*  I think one of the problems has been that maybe there's been too much attention to
*  both sides here by the world and it's given both inflated senses of themselves and a unwillingness
*  at times to compromise when they should be.
*  So I don't quite buy that argument.
*  There is a big, not a small kernel of truth, which is that Netanyahu was trying to make
*  them invisible in the current context by trying to do a normalization with Saudi Arabia.
*  That would require him to do nothing.
*  So there is truth in all of this.
*  It's just that the only way to get it, that was not necessarily through violence.
*  What if Sinwar had sent a million Gazans to walk to the border carrying the Arab Peace
*  Initiative?
*  Not one, not 10,000, a million.
*  What if a million Gazans announce that they were walking to the border peacefully, each
*  carrying the Arab Peace Initiative?
*  And what if their brethren in the West Bank said, as Israelis did in resisting Netanyahu's
*  attempted judicial coup, every Saturday night for the rest of our lives, we are going to
*  block every road in the West Bank with a map of the Arab Peace Initiative and a two-state
*  I would argue they'd be a hell of a lot better off right now.
*  They would have gotten just as much visibility, maybe a lot more.
*  And I think the pressure on Israel, if that were sustained, would have been significant.
*  Do you want to say a word on what the Arab Peace Initiative is and what it did say should
*  happen?
*  Well, I know a lot about it since I was involved in its evolution.
*  I used to write, every once in a while, phony columns, letters from President Clinton to
*  world leaders.
*  And I thought maybe of writing a letter from George W. Bush to the Arab League saying,
*  here's what you guys should do.
*  You should put forward a peace plan for Israel calling for total withdrawal to the 67 lines,
*  West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, in return for total peace, trade, tourism, commercial
*  relations and diplomatic relations.
*  So I went home and I wrote that column.
*  A week later, the Saudis invited me to come to Saudi Arabia.
*  I'd been writing very critically about them after 9-11.
*  And on that trip, in the middle of it, then King Abdullah, then Crown Prince Abdullah,
*  invited me for dinner at his horse ranch.
*  And after dinner at midnight, he asked me and Adla al-Jubeir, then the embassy spokesman
*  for the Saudis in Washington, later the foreign minister, to come to his house.
*  And at midnight, I sat at a desk with King Abdullah and Adla was the translator.
*  And the first thing King Abdullah said was, you broke into my drawer.
*  I said, Your Highness, what are you talking about?
*  He said, that peace plan you put in George Bush's voice, that was my idea.
*  I said, really?
*  Tell me about it.
*  And then he basically elaborated on that whole idea.
*  Well, we did that till about three in the morning.
*  At three in the morning, I got up and I said, Your Highness, you need to put this out to
*  the public.
*  He said, you just put it out as if that's what I'm thinking.
*  You just say it.
*  I said, no, no, you say it.
*  He said, no, no, you say it.
*  I said, no, no, you say it.
*  So we're going back and forth with Adla in the middle.
*  Finally, I said, here's what I'm going to do.
*  I'm going to write it up just as you said it.
*  And I'm going to send it to you.
*  And if you agree with it, if you're ready to stand by it, we'll write it as a column.
*  If not, we'll throw it away.
*  I went back to my hotel room.
*  I wrote it up, faxed it to him the next morning.
*  They're only faxes then.
*  He agreed with it.
*  That Sunday, it appeared as a column in the New York Times.
*  It exploded around the Arab world.
*  The Arab League decided to call an Arab League summit in Beirut around it.
*  And they added a couple things around refugees to it.
*  And it became the Arab Peace Initiative.
*  But tell me more about what it says should be done.
*  I mean, given we've done episodes on the show about some of the peace deals that God floated
*  during Camp David and elsewhere, how does it differ from the kinds of deals that Americans
*  are familiar with?
*  It called for a Palestinian state on every inch of the West Bank, Gaza, and Arab East
*  Jerusalem in return for full diplomatic relations, full commercial ties, and total normalization
*  of relations.
*  But it also, when they took it to the Arab League summit, they added at the Syrians behest.
*  And by the way, the Syrians agreed to this too.
*  They added at the Syrians request the right of return for Palestinians.
*  It was never clear how much and exactly what context, but they added a right of return.
*  And that was pretty much the only big thing that they added.
*  One of the great failures of American and Israeli diplomacy was they never really picked
*  up on it, Ezra.
*  They never picked up on it.
*  But it was very real.
*  And to this day, it is the only peace initiative the entire Arab world, through its governments
*  and the Arab League, have ever affirmed together.
*  And by the way, Ezra, they've never taken it back either.
*  So I don't want to blow up your spot here.
*  But my sense is, of us columnists, you're the one that Joe Biden, President Biden, reads
*  most closely.
*  You've had a lot more contact with him during his presidency in terms of your columns, at
*  least.
*  So play Biden whisper here for a minute for me.
*  What is your sense of what Biden, in his heart of hearts, thinks of all this?
*  I think he believes that certainly, let's start at the top, that the Jewish people have
*  a right to self-determination and a right of self-defense in Israel.
*  He also believes, I think, that Hamas is ISIS, a really evil organization, that not only
*  Israel is telling him needs to be destroyed, but quietly, every pro-American Arab leader
*  is telling him the same thing.
*  We tend to assume that Biden is only acting because of what Israel is saying, but I guarantee
*  you there are a lot of Arab leaders who do not want to see Yahya Sinwar walk out of Gaza
*  alive.
*  Let's remember Egypt's government wiped out, quite violently, the Muslim Brotherhood in
*  Egypt, which is, Hamas is just the Palestinian equivalent of that.
*  Saudi Arabia and the UAE do not allow any manifestations of the Muslim Brotherhood.
*  So I think he feels that defeating Hamas as a military organization and as a political
*  organization is a necessary but not sufficient condition for some kind of resolution between
*  Israelis and Palestinians.
*  He has been willing to give Netanyahu a lot of leash to do that, but I believe personally,
*  and have said this in my own ways, to my own contacts, I think we've given way too much
*  leash for them to do that without articulating a political horizon and a legitimate, credible
*  Palestinian partner.
*  I have a rule as recovering the Middle East.
*  What people tell you in English is irrelevant.
*  All that matters is what they say in their own language to their own people.
*  So I'm only listening to that.
*  I believe Netanyahu has been fooling Biden a little bit by saying, Joe, I'm with you,
*  but this is Netanyahu's favorite line.
*  He's used it on every secretary of state and every American president.
*  You've got to respect my political constraints.
*  I'm with you, Joe.
*  If you just get me the right kind of situation, Joe, I'm telling you, I'll surprise you.
*  How many secretaries of state have been told by Netanyahu, I'll surprise you?
*  By the way, Ezra, do you know where the Abraham Accords happened?
*  You know what happened?
*  Jared Kushner comes along, sits down with Netanyahu, and Netanyahu says, Jared, I'll
*  surprise you.
*  You take care of my political conditions, I'll surprise you.
*  So you know what Jared Kushner did?
*  He accidentally tested him.
*  He basically said to Netanyahu and Dermer, the Israeli ambassador in Washington at the
*  time, here's the map.
*  You draw what you politically need.
*  And they drew, Palestinians would get 70% of the West Bank, but not a single Israeli
*  settlement would be removed.
*  So they'd be completely non-contiguous.
*  That was the rough Trump plan.
*  By the way, it had a very creative dimension on Gaza, that Gaza would be expanded into
*  the negative.
*  It's worth reading the Trump plan on Gaza, it was actually quite creative.
*  So basically, Bibi said to Kushner, test me, and Kushner, more than any secretary of state
*  in American history, tested him by just saying, you draw it up.
*  And guess what happens?
*  Trump announces the plan, Netanyahu goes to his cabinet, and what he discovers, Ezra,
*  is that the right-wingers in his cabinet, they weren't at 70% for the Palestinians,
*  or 60, or 50, or 40, they were at zero.
*  So here Netanyahu told Kushner, test me, Kushner tests him, and what happens?
*  Netanyahu couldn't accept Netanyahu's own plan.
*  So he was completely up a tree, because his right-wingers wouldn't accept it.
*  And so the David Friedman, Trump's ambassador, tells Netanyahu, just next year, 30%, and
*  Donald Trump, God bless him, says to Netanyahu, no, you only get your 30 if you give the
*  Palestinians their 70.
*  So Netanyahu is now up a tree.
*  Along comes Yusuf Al-Attabah, the UA ambassador to the United States, with a ladder, and says,
*  Bibi, yo, Bibi, up there in the tree, I can get you down the tree if you will agree not
*  to annex, I will give you diplomatic relations.
*  And thus were the Abraham Accords born.
*  They were born because the Kushner plan completely failed on the Palestinian side, and it failed
*  because it tested Netanyahu, and Netanyahu could not accept Netanyahu's own plan.
*  I am far from the world's most sympathetic person to Bibi Netanyahu, but I want to take
*  something that you say he says a lot seriously, which is the political constraints and the
*  story you just told.
*  I love your rule from a minute ago that what gets said in English in the Middle East is
*  irrelevant.
*  And I often wonder whether or not the English speaking contacts that so many of us have
*  in Israel and among Palestinians, I've been thinking about this while I've been doing
*  this series of shows, ends up deceiving us as to the nature of the politics on the two
*  sides.
*  The non-English speaking politics are much more extreme than the English speaking politics.
*  Has Israeli and to that matter Palestinian society moved in a direction that we have
*  not yet caught up with?
*  And maybe another way of putting it is that sometimes I look at polls and the only place
*  a two state solution appears to be popular is in America and in Europe.
*  But you look at polls in Israel and among Palestinians and it's not.
*  Have these societies gone to a place that we have not followed in part because we do
*  not really want to see it?
*  That's a very good question.
*  It may be true, but there's another dimension here I think you have to focus on, which is
*  that none of these public opinions are just emergent realities.
*  They've all been cultivated and different leaders can nurture a different politics.
*  Had Bibi Netanyahu met with Abu Mazen and thanked him on the occasion where the Palestinian
*  authority had helped save lives of Jews?
*  Would Israelis all feel that way?
*  Had he anyway gone out of his way to try to build a partnership?
*  Would Israeli public opinion all feel that way?
*  So you can't just summon a constituency when you need it.
*  You have to nurture it.
*  I've had this sort of debate with people about 2000.
*  Eibarak goes to Washington, meets with Yasser Arafat, offers him 90 plus percent of the
*  West Bank, a very generous offer, unprecedented.
*  And Arafat says no.
*  Now I happen to believe Arafat was right to say no, that Palestinians already conceded
*  a majority of Palestine in the context of 1967 and the previous partition.
*  And so I think it's legitimate for them to say all of the West Bank, all of Arab East
*  Jerusalem and all of Gaza should be the future Palestinian state.
*  I would say to people, Ezra, Arafat should have said no, but he should have said no,
*  but you know what I want to do with you, Mr. Prime Minister?
*  I want to go with you from Metula to Eilat, from the northernmost city of Israel to the
*  southernmost.
*  And I want the two of us to do a tour of Israel together and I'm going to help you persuade
*  Israelis why we should get 100 percent.
*  And then I want you to come over and you're going to help me persuade Palestinians the
*  same thing.
*  That to deal with all this as if politicking doesn't matter, as if nurturing a constituency
*  doesn't matter, I think has been one of the great failures of leadership on both sides.
*  This in a way brings us, I think, back to Joe Biden.
*  Many of your columns have, and I think a lot of American commentary on this issue, ask
*  as a fundamental question, you know, what should Biden do?
*  How should he push Israel?
*  You know, you've called for tough love.
*  You've talked about it's not in America's self-interest to be supporting an Israeli
*  government that is making Oslo impossible.
*  Does Biden have leverage to push Netanyahu?
*  And even if he does, will he really use it?
*  So the answer is yes, he has leverage.
*  The question is where in the election cycle he has that and therefore when he might want
*  to use it.
*  There is politics around this issue and he's running in a very close election against Donald
*  Trump.
*  He's already probably lost a lot of Arab American votes over this.
*  He's certainly doesn't want to lose more Jewish American votes over this.
*  So we'd be naive not to think that isn't in his calculation.
*  But I'm going to throw out an idea, Ezra, that maybe it's not going to happen.
*  Maybe you won't hear about it ever again.
*  But I've been talking to people and I don't want to say it's in the administration, but
*  it's in people who talk a lot to the administration who are talking about the United States actually
*  recognizing a Palestinian state right now within provisional boundaries, the pre-1967
*  boundaries, and then making the argument that that state will come into being when Palestinians
*  meet certain institutional metrics to make it a reality.
*  I think that would be a gigantic shock to the Israeli system if it happens.
*  I think the odds of it happening are somewhere between five and eight percent.
*  But I don't think there's zero anymore.
*  Because why?
*  Because when you look at what Blinken said in his last trip to Israel, we need exactly
*  this a Palestinian authority to govern these areas, said it publicly after meeting Netanyahu.
*  When you know where Israel is, the question has to be asked, how long do we go just declaring
*  this or do we bring any leverage to bringing it about?
*  I will say, given Biden's performance here, that the polling on him is much more negative
*  and much stranger than I would have anticipated.
*  So Times in Siena did a poll in late December.
*  We found 57 percent disapproval of Biden on how he's handling Israel, only 33 percent
*  approved.
*  Among voters 18 to 29, 72 percent disapproved.
*  But then here is the other thing that I thought was really weird in that poll.
*  When asked who they trusted more on Israel, 30 percent of 18 to 29 year olds said Biden
*  and 49 percent said Trump.
*  I mean, people's sense of politics and what others may do might be hazy, but I think it's
*  hard to imagine that if you're thinking Biden has been too locked up with Israel that you'd
*  imagine Trump is your solution to that.
*  But what do you make of the morass that Biden has found himself in, the sort of absence
*  of support for him, seemingly really from any side?
*  It is a morass.
*  A lot of people have been asking me lately, like, I tend to be a positive person.
*  I try to be solution oriented.
*  Like, how does this end?
*  And I tell everybody, I have no idea.
*  I have no idea how this ends.
*  I've never seen it so broken.
*  Israel was like we were putting a thousand piece puzzle together and somebody came and
*  overturned the table, poured coffee on them and the dog is now chewing on half of them.
*  And someone's saying, well, go put that puzzle back together again.
*  And so I think Biden's just been trying to navigate this situation where he knows that
*  a weaker Hamas is necessary in order to get a more decent Palestinian government in both
*  the West Bank and Gaza.
*  He's being told that by Israelis and by Arabs, I can assure you.
*  And yet he has this partner in Israel, Netanyahu, that keeps telling him things in English that
*  he's not saying in Hebrew.
*  And his Palestinian partners are very weak and less and less legitimate every day in
*  Palestinian eyes.
*  We're talking about the Palestinian Authority.
*  And it's just a hellish situation.
*  I've been doing this since 1979 when I went to Beirut for the first time.
*  So for 44 years, I'm not surprised by much.
*  I covered the Sovereign Chattila Massacre, the Hama Massacre, the US Embassy bombing,
*  the Marine bombing, the Israeli invasion.
*  I covered a lot of really bad stuff.
*  I was surprised by the viciousness of the Hamas attack.
*  I hadn't seen people kidnapping infants before, grandparents.
*  The use of rape, it was killing parents in front of their kids, kids in front of their
*  parents.
*  I hadn't seen that before.
*  And I was shocked at the reaction on US college campuses.
*  And so I've been surprised by a lot of things.
*  And the reason to go back to a point we were talking about before, I hope Israel goes to
*  a ceasefire and gets the hostages back.
*  And whatever happens with Hamas is left for another day.
*  Because I think the hostage situation has made Israel crazy.
*  I think the war has made it crazy.
*  I don't think this can go on without the country having a kind of political nervous breakdown.
*  And I think just everyone needs, I'm not trying to trivialize this at all, but a kind of time
*  out for cooler heads to sort of prevail and think, but without hostages.
*  And it won't be a resolution, but it'll at least maybe give time for people to take in
*  what's been done, what's been done to them and what's been done by them and maybe lead
*  to better decision making.
*  You brought up the college campuses and I want to try a theory about them on you.
*  I've also been surprised by some of the dumbest things we've seen there.
*  But I also remember being in college and remember there being a lot of dumb politics.
*  And I've come to have this thought that is bothering me, which is that you can kind of
*  break the politics of Israel and America down across three generations.
*  There are sort of older Americans, boomers, who remember Israel being founded potentially,
*  who certainly remember it as young and vulnerable and as something of a miracle, as an impossibility,
*  as winning these extraordinary battles in which it was almost wiped off the map and
*  then wasn't and then gained territory and built this remarkable culture and science
*  and economy.
*  And then you have this straddle generation, which I'm sort of part of, that's how I think
*  about it, Gen X, older millennials, who sort of saw this mixed Israel and Israel that by
*  the time we were paying attention was by far the strongest power, was not vulnerable to
*  being wiped off the map, had nuclear weapons, had control, but also lived under threat,
*  right?
*  Had suicide bombings, was under attack and was also trying to find peace.
*  There was constant peace processes, the normal thing you heard about, you heard, as you put
*  earlier about the wars, but also the timeouts and the effort to become something different.
*  And so there was a fear that it had become an occupying nation, that what was happening
*  in the West Bank and Gaza, what was immoral, but it was trying to find a way out of that
*  and you could see the difficulty of it.
*  And then you have this third generation that has only ever known the Israel of Benjamin
*  Netanyahu, right?
*  They only know the Israel last 15 years, which had stopped trying to find a way to peace,
*  which had settled into simply occupying the West Bank that has become much more right
*  wing, that had this blockade around Gaza.
*  When I look at those protests, right, there's always the craziest sign at the protest, there's
*  always like the dumbest campus group you can find.
*  But when I look at the polling, where you see much less support for Israel among young
*  people, when I look at why most people are out in the streets at a protest on behalf
*  of Gaza, it's not mainly that they're anti-Semitic.
*  And I think there's an effort to try to not see the thing behind the thing that is easier
*  to see.
*  And this sort of collapse of support for Israel among people who are younger, because Israel
*  just looks like something different to them, seems both like it's picking up on something
*  real, but also like a genuine threat to Israel in the long run, because Joe Biden and people
*  of his generation are not going to be president forever.
*  And I feel like the sort of rising generational threat to Israel, which people are trying
*  to deal with by shutting these protests down and getting college presidents fired and being
*  angry at the kids.
*  But what you do about that story that has taken hold and what they've seen now, including
*  social media, direct from Gaza, when you think on the 15 or 20 year timeframe, that's something
*  I think to take seriously.
*  I'm curious if that tracks for you.
*  100%.
*  So I'll take you back to Barack Obama's president and Netanyahu maneuvers the Republicans with
*  the help of AIPAC, which I think will go down in history as one of the most destructive
*  in Jewish history as well, for the way it not only abetted Netanyahu's every action
*  of settling the West Bank, but for the way it abetted his destruction of the Iran nuclear
*  deal, which I think is one of the worst decisions in the history of American foreign policy
*  and now really looks so frightening that Iran is now weeks away from a bomb instead of a
*  year away from the bomb as that treaty would have made possible.
*  So Netanyahu insists on coming to Congress.
*  Barack Obama and Joe Biden will not invite him.
*  And he manipulates the Congress to get himself invited through the Republicans.
*  I did a column at that time that was rather controversial.
*  I said, you know, AIPAC can manipulate Congress to get Bibi an invitation to speak at the
*  U.S. Congress.
*  But you know where Bibi can't speak?
*  He can't speak at the University of Wisconsin.
*  I wrote in that column, Ezra, that if Bibi Netanyahu were to try to speak at the University
*  of Wisconsin, they would have to bring out the National Guard.
*  Today, Ezra, they'd have to bring out the 82nd Airborne.
*  So I was keenly aware of exactly the narrative you described.
*  It was beautifully said of this erosion of the Netanyahu years, which basically said
*  American Jews, we don't need you.
*  You're all going to intermarry Gentiles.
*  We only need Republicans and evangelicals.
*  And we're going to make Israel a wedge issue for the benefit of Republicans.
*  And as a result, a generation grew up seeing only the Israel of Netanyahu, pro-evangelical,
*  pro-Republican.
*  What happened basically, I think, on October 8th on American college campuses is the 16
*  years of Netanyahu melded with a decade of sort of woke politics on a lot of these campuses
*  and exploded the whole American consensus on Israel.
*  It all kind of came to a head, the meeting of those two things.
*  And it's a real threat for Israel in the long run.
*  Joe Biden, as I've written, I think will be the last pro-Israel American Democratic president.
*  And I've had a lot of parents ask me to talk to their kids.
*  Now, not a lot.
*  I've had several friends ask me to talk to their kids.
*  And when I do, I try to explain to them that to think about Israel,
*  you have to actually hold three thoughts in your head at the same time.
*  And to think about Palestinians now, you have to hold three thoughts in your head at the same time.
*  On Israel, the three thoughts are that Israel is an amazing place.
*  What is built in 75 years is amazing by way of in-gathering of exiles, of culture,
*  of revival, of literature, of science, technology, agriculture.
*  Israel's, it's an amazing achievement, number one.
*  Number two, Israel does really bad stuff sometimes, particularly in the West Bank,
*  steals Palestinians' land, allows settlers to kill Palestinians with impunity,
*  lets Israeli Arabs be treated as second-class citizens.
*  And third, Israel lives in a crazy, dangerous neighborhood, and the weak don't survive.
*  Now, the same, I believe, is true with Palestinians.
*  Thought number one, Palestinians suffered a true, what they call, nakba, a communal tragedy.
*  Another people, an indigenous people, but another people came back in large numbers to claim their
*  historic homeland.
*  And even if they were ready to share it in the end, for Palestinians,
*  it resulted in a mass refugee population being created of people who were driven out
*  or left by fear.
*  And it was a real communal tragedy that no community should ever want to endure.
*  They're calling it a nakba, a great tragedy, is not an exaggeration.
*  Number two is Palestinians do bad and stupid stuff.
*  They've missed enormous opportunities.
*  They've fought each other.
*  They've done vile things to Jews.
*  They've had a government that tolerated too much corruption.
*  They do bad stuff.
*  And third, Palestinians live in an incredibly dangerous neighborhood
*  that has often exploited them.
*  There's a phrase in Arabic for many years, from 1948 till the present.
*  It said, no voice shall be louder than the battle.
*  Every Arab dictator loved to use that quote.
*  No voice shall be louder than the battle.
*  That was saying no voice should be louder than the battle for Palestine.
*  Therefore, don't pay attention to my autocracy and my corruption.
*  Let's just talk about Palestine.
*  They were used by the neighborhood in ways that were unfair and deeply detrimental to
*  their cause.
*  And unfortunately, the world is dynamic.
*  It's complicated.
*  And if you can't hold all six of these thoughts in your head at the same time,
*  along with the seventh, that one of the greatest tragedies is that when Israelis were ready to
*  make peace, Palestinians weren't.
*  And when Palestinians were ready to make peace, Israelis weren't, which is common to both of them.
*  Really, if you can't hold those seven thoughts in your head at the same time,
*  really don't come to this story.
*  And I have a very simple rule.
*  I'm for a two-state solution.
*  I'm for two states for two people.
*  If you're for that, you're my friend.
*  And if you're not for that, you're not my friend.
*  And I don't care whether we're the Israeli or Arab or Palestinian or Jew or Zoroastrian.
*  And that's always been my North Star.
*  And that's what's kept me balanced because my motto is, do you want to make a point or do you
*  want to make a difference?
*  And I really want to make a difference.
*  So I'm focused on how we advance that and not focused on all the other stuff.
*  It's a good place to end.
*  So then always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Well, in honor of this interview, The Little Drummer Girl by John Le Carre,
*  which is a study in all the moral complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
*  The second is on my desk, The Splendid in the Vile by Eric Larson,
*  which is just an amazing study in leadership.
*  And Lord knows we need leadership now.
*  And lastly, to make it more personal, I'm Your Man,
*  The Life of Leonard Cohen by Sylvia Simons, because I love Leonard Cohen.
*  I love his music and I need a little dose of hallelujah right now.
*  All right.
*  This is great.
*  Well, Tom, I'm excited to hear what Secretary Blinken says in response to the plan.
*  And really, thank you.
*  This was great.
*  I've told you this privately, but I've been so, so admiring of your columns.
*  I think you've played a uniquely important and needed role here.
*  Well, that means a ton to me and back at you.
*  So let's do it again sometime.
*  All right.
*  Thank you, sir.
*  Thanks, Adrie.
