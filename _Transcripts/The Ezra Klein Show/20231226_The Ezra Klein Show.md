# Best Of: The Most Amazing — and Dangerous — Technology in the World
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuL3UQte44)
*  Hey, it is Ezra. We are on our holiday break, but I wanted to re-air one of my favorite
*  episodes of the year and one that I think gets at a number of the most important stories.
*  China, AI, a lot of global strategic competition, which is this discussion of semiconductors,
*  which have become one of the fundamental technologies of the 21st century, the locus of a lot of
*  international maneuvering, military competition, and also just a remarkable thing to contemplate,
*  that humans actually create and build. But because it is such a remarkable thing to create
*  and build, it's very easy for it to all fall apart. Enjoy.
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So you may have noticed at the beginning of the year that two themes are really dominating
*  the show, China and AI. And obviously that's not an accident. I'm not going to try to rank
*  or order what matters most in the world, but these are two good contenders for the top
*  five at least. When I imagine the history books getting written of our era, it is very
*  hard for me not to imagine these being dominant themes. And these stories connect. They connect
*  in obvious ways. There's a geopolitics of who controls AI, a race between the US and
*  China to get the strongest and earliest AI capabilities. But they also connect in another,
*  tangible way. They're both stories driven by semiconductors and who controls them. In the
*  same way that you couldn't understand geopolitics in the 20th century without understanding oil and
*  other forms of energy, where it was and who had it and who needed it and what they would do to get
*  it, you can't understand the major stories of the 21st century without understanding semiconductors.
*  Whoever controls semiconductors controls the future. And it turns out for reasons I didn't
*  really understand until I read Chris Miller's book Chip Orr, that semiconductors really can be
*  controlled. So Chip Orr, which is just amazingly timed, given how deep it is, is a history of
*  semiconductors as a technology, as an industry, and then it traces the way they have and are
*  shaping geopolitics. It was a Financial Times' business book of the year in 2022. And having
*  read it now, definitely going to be on my year end list of the most important books I read in 2023.
*  And there's a lot more in the book than I'm able to cover in the show. I really do recommend reading
*  this one. But I do think the show is one of the more important we're going to do and important
*  for understanding a lot of the other shows we're going to do, because this is getting in a material
*  reality that is easy to miss, but is going to shape so many of the big stories we're living
*  through in the coming years. As always, my email, eserclineshowatnytimes.com.
*  Chris Miller, welcome to the show.
*  Chris Miller Thanks for having me.
*  Pete Slauson What timing on this book, man. I assume,
*  when did you actually start it? Because I honestly cannot imagine a better moment for it to have come
*  out. Chris Miller Well, I started researching it around 2015, 2016, didn't start writing until
*  2020, and finished writing early 2022, just as the chip shortage was reaching its peak.
*  Pete Slauson So let's talk a bit about why semiconductors end up mattering this much.
*  You write that we rarely think about chips, yet they've created the modern world. Justify that for me.
*  Chris Miller Well, today, people like you and me can't live our lives without touching
*  hundreds or thousands of chips just going about the course of our daily lives. We think of chips
*  as being in smartphones or being in PCs, but today they're in almost any device with an on-off
*  switch. So a new car will have a thousand chips inside of it, your refrigerator, your microwave,
*  your dishwasher, all of our devices are full of chips that do computing, do sensing,
*  increasingly do communication, and so the modern economy just can't function without lots and lots
*  of chips. Pete Slauson
*  I don't know if this will be a hard question or an easy question for you, but like most people,
*  and particularly before I read the book, I have only the haziest idea of what a semiconductor chip
*  actually does. So you often describe it as providing the processing power of the modern world.
*  What is it actually doing? Chris Miller
*  So a chip is a piece of silicon with a lot of tiny circuits carved into it, and these circuits are
*  either completed or interrupted via a device called a transistor, which is a switch basically
*  that turns the motor off. And when a circuit is on, it produces a one. When it's off, it produces a
*  zero, and all of the ones and zeros that undergird all of software, all of data storage,
*  it's just circuits turning on or off to produce the right digit. And today, we have lots of digits
*  we require because we store and process lots of data. And so advanced semiconductors today have
*  millions or often billions of these tiny circuits etched into them that provide the ones and zeros
*  that modern computing requires. Pete Slauson
*  Tell me about that size. When you say you have billions of these circuits on a chip,
*  how small are we talking? How is that possible to be etching or really doing anything at that scale?
*  Chris Miller Today, if you go to an
*  Apple store, for example, and buy a new iPhone, just the primary chip in an iPhone will have
*  around 15 billion transistors on it. And so each one of these tiny switches is smaller than the
*  size of a virus. They're measured in a number of nanometers, which is a billionth of a meter.
*  And so these are the smallest devices that humans have ever mass produced. And we produce more of
*  them than we produced any other device in human history. Pete Slauson
*  Tell me a bit about how quickly we've been able to shrink the scale at which we're working here
*  and increase the density of the chips. I mean, these aren't a very old technology. As you point
*  out, Silicon Valley, which has not been around forever, gets its name from the silicon of which
*  these chips are made. So when this starts, what is the level of complexity? When is that? And
*  what is the process by which we get to today? Chris Miller
*  The first chips were invented in the late 1950s. They first became commercially
*  available in the early 1960s. And at the time, they would have had a handful of transistors on
*  them. And the rate at which we were able to pack more transistors onto a chip, which was also the
*  same as the rate that we were able to shrink transistors down to enable more of them to fit on
*  a piece of silicon has increased exponentially. So there's been basically a doubling of the number
*  of transistors you can fit on a given size chip every two years since the 1960s. And that's come
*  to be known as Moore's Law named after Gordon Moore, who was one of the early engineers that
*  created the industry and eventually went on to found Intel. And what that's meant is that the chip
*  industry has produced improvements that have gone far beyond any other aspect of the economy. There's
*  nowhere else in the economy that we've had exponential growth rates persist for not only years,
*  but half a century. Chris Miller
*  Let's talk for a minute here about Moore's Law, because there's a, I think, a misleading way in
*  which it's called a law. It's not like the second law of thermodynamics or something. It isn't,
*  it isn't a law. It's an early observation that ends up being weirdly predictive. So what is he
*  looking at Gordon Moore, who actually recently just died? What is he looking at when he makes
*  that observation? And then why in your view, does it not just come true, but come true beyond his
*  own expectations for it? Chris Miller
*  So he made this observation in 1965, which was just seven years after the first chip was invented.
*  And he noticed that the number of transistors per chip was doubling every year or two. And he
*  predicted given the technology that he saw being developed at the time, it would last for at least
*  another decade through 1975. And that proved true. But as that was proven true, chips became more
*  powerful, also cheaper, because you could get more computing power with a smaller and smaller chip.
*  And they found more use cases across the economy. So the first chips were used primarily for
*  defense systems. But as the cost of computing power fell, it became possible to apply them
*  to more and more uses to corporate computers, for example, then to pocket calculators, then to
*  automobiles. And as the use cases proliferated, the investment dollars going into
*  further shrinking transistors and further packing more computing power into chips also
*  increased dramatically. And so there's been a sort of virtuous cycle between the cost of computing
*  declining and even more investment dollars going into driving that down further because
*  people realize that there were a lot more uses for computing than anyone really imagined
*  at the time that Gordon Moore first coined the concept of Moore's law.
*  Pete O'Reilly Which direction does that causality run? Were
*  there more uses for computing than anybody imagined? Or are there more uses for computing
*  than anybody imagined because such computing is now possible?
*  Jason Suellentrop You know, I think it's actually both in some ways. Gordon Moore himself wrote a
*  couple of essays looking into the future computing. And at the time, he predicted devices like what he
*  called personal portable communications equipment, sort of like a smartphone, if you will. He
*  envisioned home computers that would be networked together, sort of like the internet. So it was
*  possible to envision some pretty futuristic uses. But I think even he was shocked by just the
*  diversity of applications of computing and the ways in which they transformed society. He could
*  predict portable communications devices, but I think even he was shocked by the iPhone when it
*  first emerged a half century later. Pete O'Reilly
*  I want to key in on an example of what it has taken to keep Moore's law going for as long as it has.
*  Because I also think having this in people's minds is important for the geopolitics and the
*  policy that's going to come in this conversation. So you spend some time that I would describe as
*  somewhere between loving and odd, describing the development of EUV lithography. So tell me that
*  story in some detail. What is it and how did it get from a hope to a reality?
*  Jason Suellentrop One of the process steps in manufacturing chips is projecting a pattern
*  onto the silicon, a pattern that describes where the transistors will be. And at first,
*  you could actually do these patterns by hand because transistors were large enough to be
*  carved out by hand. But as they've become smaller, you need to project them using sort of like a
*  microscope backwards. Microscopes take optics to make something small look big. And we do the
*  opposite to make a big pattern projected in a very small form onto a chip. And for a long time,
*  the optics involved were pretty straightforward. And you could use visible light to project the
*  patterns and interact with chemicals and specific ways to carve transistors onto chips. But as
*  they've gotten smaller and smaller, the wavelength of visible light has gotten far too broad to
*  actually carve transistors in the way that we want. So visible light has a wavelength of several
*  hundred nanometers, depending on the color, whereas the transistors on your smartphone are far smaller
*  than that in dimension. And so around three decades ago, in the early 1990s, scientists began
*  developing a new type of lithography more precise using smaller wavelength light in the ultraviolet
*  spectrum. And this was necessary to get the precision, but it was also extraordinarily
*  complex to produce. And so today, there's just one company that is capable of producing the machines
*  that are capable of providing this light at the scale and with the precision necessary. And these
*  machines are the most complex machines humans have ever made. They require one of the most powerful
*  lasers that has ever been deployed in a commercial device. They have an explosion happening inside of
*  them at 40 or 50 times hotter than the surface of the sun. And because of all this precision, they
*  require $150 million per machine to produce, require multiple airplanes to move. They're
*  extraordinary accomplishments of human engineering, but also wildly complex. And that complexity has
*  made modern chip making more and more difficult, but it's the only way to get the precision that
*  we require. They also, from the way you tell the story, represent remarkable accomplishments
*  of supply chain management and to some degree globalization. So it's a Dutch company making
*  these systems, but they are a company that does a lot of sourcing. They don't just make the system
*  in a factory somewhere. You talk about just the laser needed for the system, which comes from
*  another company, which is called slightly weirdly Trump with a PNNF. And you say that the laser itself
*  requires exactly 457,329 component parts, many of which need to be made by different players.
*  So you're dealing with the sourcing when you then scale up to the entire machine
*  of a number of parts. It seems almost unimaginable. Yeah, that's right. And the engineering doesn't
*  simply happen on the machine itself. The supply chain itself is, is an engineered process carefully
*  sculpted to select the suppliers that this company knows they can trust suppliers that they know they
*  can deliver time and suppliers that they know that can deliver high quality products. Because if you
*  think, for example, of what it takes to keep a machine with hundreds of thousands of component
*  parts operational, the mean time to failure of each of those parts has to be measured in the decades
*  or else the machine never works. So that level of precision and reliability has been extraordinarily
*  difficult to produce. And it's why there's just one company in the world that is capable of producing
*  this. So something you trace in your story is that for some time now,
*  chips have been this hidden geopolitical force. You tell it in part through the changes in military
*  power and what got called in the US, the offset strategy beginning sort of late in Vietnam,
*  as that war was failing, but then building into something that created an era of quite profound
*  American military dominance, which was then noticed by everybody else and others are trying
*  to match. Can you talk a bit about how these ended up changing not just warfare, but America's military
*  position vis a vis competitors? The US military was actually one of the early drivers of innovation
*  in semiconductors. The first chips that were created were created for guidance computers in
*  both space systems and in missile systems. And the Pentagon funded a lot of the early research
*  in semiconductors and still is a major funder of a lot of cutting edge research today. The military
*  was interested in semiconductors because it wanted to miniaturize computing power to distribute it
*  across battlefields. If you think back to the earliest computers in the 1940s or 1950s, they
*  were the size of rooms, far too large to be deployed in systems in the field. And so the
*  military wanted to find a miniaturization technique and chips were the answer. And over the
*  course of the Cold War, the US military deployed chips in all manner of devices and in airplanes,
*  in satellites, in missile guidance systems. And a lot of the precision that we take for granted
*  today in military systems, the idea that you could launch a missile and have it hit a target
*  hundreds of miles away with pretty close to perfect accuracy is only possible because of lots and lots
*  of semiconductors, chips in the missile that guided chips in the satellites that send signals
*  as it identifies its location over the course of its flight, chips in the sensors that are collecting
*  targeting information, chips in the communication systems that are distributing this data across
*  the battlefield. And so the US military was actually the first institution to show the ways
*  that the distribution of computing and sensing that chips provide can transform how organizations
*  work and can provide extraordinary value in terms of networking different devices together.
*  And so that was important both in explaining why the US jumped ahead in military power
*  during the late Cold War, but it also provided an example for the rest of the world to see
*  not only how militaries, but how all institutions could take advantage of semiconductors to provide
*  new types of capabilities they previously hadn't imagined.
*  A point you make towards the end of the book is that one reason Russia has struggled so badly
*  in its effort to invade Ukraine is that they're using a lot of pretty technologically rudimentary
*  military hardware that a surprising number of their munitions we're seeing are unguided.
*  They're not sort of modern smart weapons that a lot of what we're giving and Europe is given to
*  Ukraine are more precision oriented like the Javelin missiles that people have probably heard
*  about. Can you talk a bit about how that's played out into the balance of military
*  power and force there now as we speak? It's been hugely important in a number of different ways,
*  partly as you say, because the Russians just have less sophisticated equipment than we're able to
*  give to the Ukrainians, partly because even in the relatively sophisticated equipment that the
*  Russians have, they're using pirated or smuggled in version of Western microelectronics, Western
*  chips, which are not custom made for their defense systems in which Russia's never sure whether
*  they're getting counterfeit versions or the real thing. So even when Russia is able to acquire
*  more advanced Western chips from abroad, there's all sorts of issues it creates in their supply
*  chain and their systems integration as a result. But then perhaps the most important is that Ukraine
*  has benefited from all the intelligence gathering and processing capabilities that the US military
*  has, which is largely today a question of signals intelligence, of satellite photos, of radio
*  signals being gathered, decoded, processed. And this is intensely reliant on computing power, both to
*  understand what's being said and then to dissect signal from noise and give the Ukrainians the
*  useful information. So when you think about a high Mars rocket, for example, the easy part of the
*  computing is actually guiding the rocket towards its target. The hard part is identifying where
*  the targets are in a rapid enough fashion so that the target hasn't moved by the time you want to
*  fire it. And that is thanks to US intelligence gathering, which today is more dependent than
*  ever on semiconductors. The next turn of this wheel, both militarily and more broadly economically,
*  seems to be different forms of machine learning of artificial intelligence. And that's a story we
*  tend to talk about in terms of data. You'll hear things like data is a new oil story we sometimes
*  talk about in terms of training algorithms and theories like deep learning. And it's a story
*  that is very much grounded in semiconductors that if you're talking about training next generation
*  artificial intelligence systems, you're talking about these chips. So can you talk a bit about the
*  interrelationship there and sort of what kinds of chips have become crucial for AI and the way that
*  has also begun to play into different major countries conceptions of what you need for
*  geopolitical primacy? If you want to train a sophisticated AI system, you do need lots of
*  data to train it on. But that data is only possible to process and to remember by deploying
*  lots of advanced chips. And so today, for training AI systems, there's a type of a chip called a GPU,
*  a graphics processor unit, which was actually originally invented for computer graphics. But
*  the math that the chip was capable of processing turned out to be useful for training as well.
*  And so today, there's just a couple of companies that produce or design the most advanced AI chips,
*  and in particular, a company called Nvidia, based in California produces the majority of the chips
*  used for AI training in the world. And Nvidia manufactures all of its leading chips at one
*  company TSMC in Taiwan. So underneath all of the AI training happening around the world, whether in
*  the US or in Europe or in China are chips produced by just a couple of companies. And that produces a
*  level of political influence that the US in particular has tried to wield in recent years.
*  So you brought up Taiwan here, which is a helpful bridge for me because you spend a lot of the book
*  focused on this one Taiwanese firm TSMC, which produces 90% of the world's most advanced chips,
*  90%. And let's start here by talking about why, why does TSMC have this hammer lock over the most
*  advanced chips? I think the number you have in the book is they're producing or Taiwan is producing
*  more than a third of new computing power every year. How? So there are only three companies in
*  the world that are anywhere close to being able to produce cutting edge processor chips TSMC in Taiwan
*  Samsung in South Korea and Intel in the United States. And the complexity and the cost involved
*  of cutting edge production means that these three firms will be the only three firms close to the
*  cutting edge for at least the next half decade, probably longer. So there's just extraordinary
*  concentration in the industry when you get close to the leading edge because of the expense and
*  the sophisticated technology involved. TSMC is the leader of those three because when it was
*  founded in 1987, it was founded with a unique business model. Morris Chang, the individual who
*  founded the company had a vision of not designing any chips, only manufacturing them. And before
*  that point, almost all chip firms both designed chips and manufactured them in house. But Morris
*  Chang realized at the time that the complexity of both design and manufacturing was growing
*  in a way that would require firms to specialize. And so he set up TSMC promising never to design
*  any chips, but only to manufacture them. And he was able as a result to serve many different
*  customers. Today, he manufactures chips for Apple, for Nvidia, for AMD, for Qualcomm, many of the
*  biggest chip design firms. But he doesn't compete with any of them because TSMC doesn't do any
*  design itself. And so TSMC is now the world's largest chip maker. Because it's the world's
*  largest chip maker, it has reaped extraordinary economies of scale, letting it drive down costs.
*  And what's most important is that there's a pretty clear relationship between the number of chips you
*  produce and your ability to hone your technology over time because you get data for each chip you
*  develop. And so TSMC has been able to develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies
*  as a result of its scale. And so today, TSMC produces, as you said, 90% of the most advanced
*  processors, the types of processors that go into smartphones, PCs, data centers. The other 10% are
*  produced by Samsung of South Korea. And Intel right now is a generation or two behind what either of
*  those firms are capable of producing. Tell me about the political economy of TSMC's
*  birth and rise. Because we can tell the story of Intel, you have a bunch of scrappy young weirdos,
*  they're at one firm and then another and then they go to another or found another, I should say.
*  And it's a very Silicon Valley story. And TSMC isn't like that. It's a sort of public-private
*  hybrid institution. So tell me a bit of their story. So TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris
*  Chang, who at the time had been a tech executive at Texas Instruments for almost three decades.
*  He was passed over for the CEO job. And so he was looking for something else to do. And he was
*  approached by the government of Taiwan, which wanted to create a chip industry that was moving
*  up the value chain. At that time, Taiwan was a producer of relatively low value electronics and
*  wanted to produce higher value semiconductors. And the government gave Morris Chang a sort of
*  a blank check to set up a new firm. It provided half the capital for the company and got a number
*  of Taiwanese business people to invest another 25% in the firm and was very supportive of the
*  company's early development. And so in some ways, it was very much a public-private partnership.
*  But in other ways, the company had to survive from day one by selling to the international
*  market because the domestic market in Taiwan was far too small to sustain a semiconductor industry.
*  So the firm had to sink or swim by selling manufacturing services to largely US firms
*  from day one. And so in a lot of ways, TSMC has grown up alongside a new set of semiconductor
*  design firms that previously didn't exist because there weren't companies like TSMC that
*  manufacture chips, but have been able to thrive because they haven't had to worry about manufacturing.
*  They've outsourced all that to TSMC and have designed chips instead. And so companies like
*  Apple, which manufactures all of its key chips at TSMC or Nvidia, the company that makes the
*  chips that train AI systems, they've never had to build their own manufacturing facilities because
*  TSMC handles all the cost and understands all the manufacturing technology. So they don't have to
*  worry about it. And that's been a very effective business model, both for TSMC, but also for
*  the US chip design firms that have always been TSMC's largest customers.
*  Let's say I designed a computer virus tomorrow. That what it did is it simply targeted every TSMC
*  location worldwide and knocked out all their electronics. So effectively, the company ceases
*  to in any way function tomorrow, and there's no real way to get it back online. What happens to
*  the global economy after that? We'd face an economic crisis globally akin to the disruptions
*  that we saw during the Great Depression. It's not just tech devices like smartphones or PCs that
*  would be catastrophically disrupted. And we certainly struggled to build a cell phone
*  anywhere in the world for the next year or so. We'd have PC production fall easily by a third,
*  maybe by half. Data center rollouts would grind to a halt. It'd be hard to build a cell phone tower
*  anywhere in the world because cell phone towers are just big metal poles with lots of chips on
*  top of them. But it's also all other manufactured goods. So dishwashers and microwaves and automobiles,
*  they don't necessarily need the most advanced chips, but Taiwan doesn't only produce the
*  most advanced chips. They produce lots of less advanced chips as well. And the semiconductor
*  shortage the last couple of years illustrated that it's not only the tech sector that's reliant
*  on chips, it's companies like car firms too. During the chip shortage of 2020, 2021, the world's car
*  industry faced an estimated $200 billion worth of losses because they couldn't sell as many cars
*  as they'd hoped because they couldn't get all the chips that they needed. And there's lots of
*  different countries that produce chips and cars. But if you think of a typical new car having a
*  thousand chips inside and figure 10, 20, 30% of those ships generally come from Taiwan,
*  replacing those would be an extraordinary challenge. And we'd see huge disruptions across
*  the entire world's manufacturing sectors. And final point is that it's not just the US that's
*  reliant on chips from Taiwan. It's everyone. It's Europe. It's Japan. It's China. The entire world's
*  manufacturing sector requires TSMC's chips. And so there's TSMC's chips, but we also mentioned
*  this Dutch manufacturer, lithography. This is a place you say where the oil metaphor misleads,
*  but probably not in the direction that people would think. If I say chips like the new oil,
*  you might think, well, that's great because we know that there's only oil in so many places and
*  chips all you need is a manufacturing facility. But you write that unlike oil, which can be bought
*  from many countries, our production of computing power depends fundamentally on a series of choke
*  points, tools, chemicals, and software that are often produced by a handful of companies.
*  And sometimes only one. So beyond TSMC, tell me a bit about the level of vulnerability and
*  choke points here. What every step in the production process of an advanced semiconductor,
*  whether it's the software tools that are used to design them, the machine tools, like the
*  lithography systems that are used to manufacture them, the actual manufacturing often at TSMC,
*  there's usually just a couple of companies that are capable of producing the most cutting edge
*  capabilities. And that's just because it's very expensive and very hard to do so. And
*  specialization has been critical to the industry. That's why we're able to produce semiconductors
*  with 15 billion transistors on them at a price that all of us can afford. But it's also created
*  risks and vulnerabilities because in some cases, there's only a single source for certain types
*  of materials or tools. And that creates single points of potential failure. And the world,
*  I think, has done a reasonable job of managing many of these risks. We've made an error somewhat
*  in putting a lot of our chipmaking capacity in seismically active zones like Silicon Valley
*  and Japan and Taiwan. But actually, we've been able to manage that risk somewhat too. But
*  obviously, the biggest risk hanging over the industry today is the concentration in the
*  Taiwan Straits, where compared to five or 10 years ago, there's far more concern that something
*  might go wrong. And if it does, we're guaranteed to get vast disruptions in chip supply.
*  So this to me has been a very undernoticed part of America's commitment to Taiwan and America's
*  concern about China potentially taking Taiwan. I think most people hear this. And they think,
*  in reality, why would we really care that much about Taiwan? I mean, we don't want China becoming
*  territorially expansionist. Taiwan is our friend. But why do we really, like real politic,
*  care about Taiwan? And one reason seems to be that you lose Taiwan and you lose the semiconductor
*  industry, that Taiwan is a point of vulnerability for the entire world. And that really raises
*  the stakes on this. So can you talk a bit about the ways in which the geopolitics around Taiwan
*  have become merged with the dependence we all have on semiconductors?
*  Matthew 18.11 If you ask the Taiwanese government, what they'll tell you is that
*  Taiwan's position in the chip industry creates what they call the silicon shield. The idea being
*  that it would be too expensive for anyone to disrupt the chip supply coming out of Taiwan,
*  and therefore no one will be willing to do so. And I think that might be true, but I'm not sure
*  about it. It's also the case that Taiwan's chip production guarantees that the US is interested in
*  ensuring ongoing good relations between the US and Taiwan and peace between China and Taiwan. And that
*  dynamic is certainly true as well. I also think it's probably an oversimplification to argue that
*  semiconductors are the primary reason or a primary reason that either China or the US are
*  interested in Taiwan, because of course, both countries have been involved in the Taiwan
*  question since 1949, before the first chips were invented. And so in some ways, we have
*  semiconductors sitting at the center of the competition in the Asia region between the US
*  and China. But in other ways, the competition is largely driven by political and military factors
*  that intersect with chips, but are far from guaranteed to ensure that their supply is
*  uninterrupted. And so I do worry that actually chips don't provide a deterrence against conflict,
*  or don't guarantee that conflict won't happen. But actually, they would be the first disruption
*  and the first most dramatic disruption that we face if in case conflict does materialize.
*  So as a result, I finished my study of the chip industry and the ways it intersects with the
*  China US relationship much more worried thinking that perhaps it's stabilizing,
*  but perhaps it's not. And if it's not stabilizing, we're in a very vulnerable position.
*  Let's talk about the chips question.
*  Tell me a bit about the chips question from China's perspective, you make the point that
*  China now spends more money importing chips and it spends importing oil, which is a striking fact.
*  How does this look to them?
*  Well, for China's leaders, it's an extraordinary vulnerability, both because they're well aware
*  that in case of a crisis, they're likely to lose access to the most advanced chips produced
*  in Taiwan, also in Korea, Japan and the United States. They also see it as an economic vulnerability,
*  because for China's electronics industry, moving up the value chain requires producing semiconductors.
*  If you look, for example, at a smartphone, most of the world's smartphones are assembled in China,
*  but most of the high value components of a smartphone are semiconductors. And so even in
*  Chinese branded smartphones assembled in China, most of the bill of materials ends up going to
*  Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean firms, because they're producing the chips inside of these phones. And so
*  if China wants to progress technologically, economically, they believe they've got to
*  domesticate production of semiconductors. And the challenge they face is that the Chinese
*  government has been struggling to do so. They've been spending billions of dollars a year since
*  2014 to try to produce cutting edge chips domestically. They've made some progress in
*  a number of spheres, but in aggregate, they still remain fundamentally dependent not only
*  importing chips, but also the chips that China does produce domestically are produced almost
*  exclusively using imported machine tools like the lithography tools that I described. And so
*  although China is a manufacturing powerhouse, it's actually a small player when it comes to
*  the production of semiconductors, especially when we're talking about cutting edge semiconductors.
*  Pete Slauson Can you talk about the idea of weaponized
*  interdependence?
*  Jason Slauson Well, this is a phrase that was popularized by two
*  political scientists several years ago who noted that in theory, many people had thought that
*  interdependence would produce peace, it would increase the incentive for political actors to
*  cooperate because they had economic incentives to do so. But in reality, what we were seeing
*  in the world was that interdependence was not only relevant in terms of building bridges between
*  countries, but it was also a sphere of competition. And that countries were using their privileged
*  position in certain networks to try to cut out or to punish their competitors. And we've seen this in
*  cyber networks, for example, where the US has a unique capability to conduct cyber espionage
*  because a lot of the world's key data centers and cables transfer through the US. We see it in
*  financial networks, the US also has a unique position. We also see it increasingly in
*  semiconductors because the US sits at the center of many of the world's semiconductor supply chains
*  and the other key nodes are close US allies like Taiwan, like Japan. And what that's meant is that
*  the US government over the past 10 years or so has been able to surgically cut China out of certain
*  parts of the chip industry while keeping China dependent on many other types of chips. And so
*  whether it's cutting edge tools, cutting edge software, or certain types of chips, like the
*  chips used to train AI systems, the US is able to say China can't have access and is able to force
*  the world's chip firms to basically comply. I think the political history of our policies
*  here is interesting. There's a pretty sharp discontinuity between Obama and Trump,
*  and quite a bit of continuity on this from Trump to Biden. So first, can we talk about the Obama to
*  Trump change? What is the Obama administration's perspective on semiconductor competition,
*  dominance, particularly around China? What do they do about it? And then how does the Trump
*  administration change that? What do they actually do differently than the Obama administration had
*  done? I think the Obama administration in their final year or two in office was
*  beginning to actually trend in the direction that the Trump administration eventually
*  took things. But it certainly was the Trump administration that was first willing to
*  disrupt supply chains, first willing to take costly measures, and first willing to characterize tech
*  competition as more zero-sum than positive-sum when it came to China. And so as a result of
*  this new worldview, the Trump administration took a variety of steps in the semiconductor space to
*  cut off China and to punish China for efforts to steal technology from Western firms. So for
*  example, the US put out of business a company called Fujian Jinhua, which had been found to be
*  stealing technology from a US chipmaker called Micron by banning this firm from accessing
*  machine tools that are made in the United States without which it's impossible to produce
*  semiconductors. And so overnight, this company went out of business because it couldn't get
*  the requisite tools. And this was a really dramatic step. It was very different from the
*  prior US strategy of starting WTO cases, for example, or trying legal measures. And this
*  was just an executive measure that said this Chinese firm can't access the tools anymore.
*  And that began to illustrate the power that the US regulators had to determine who got access to
*  chips and chipmaking tools and who didn't. Another example is Huawei, the Chinese telecoms firm. The
*  US banned Huawei from accessing certain types of chips and forced Huawei to divest entire business
*  lines. And that again, illustrated that even China's leading tech firms were producing technology that
*  required foreign semiconductors, US, Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean inside. And US policymakers,
*  I think, were impressed and in some ways even surprised by the power that this demonstrated.
*  And that explains why the Biden administration has in somewhat different ways, but in the large
*  sense carried on the weaponization of semiconductor supply chains that the Trump administration
*  started. Let's talk about the the Fuji and Jinwa story in more detail, because the way it sounds
*  there, it's like mean America comes in and puts out the business's Chinese company. But you tell
*  the story in some detail in your book. And what was happening before that, which was in some ways,
*  I don't want to exactly call it normal, but a common complaint of American businesses dealing
*  with China, which then the Trump administration decides they're not going to stand for anymore,
*  is pretty interesting at getting at, I think, at the other side of the frustrations here. So
*  can you walk through that a little bit more slowly? There's a US firm called Micron,
*  which produces memory chips and had a facility in Taiwan, actually. And a number of the engineers
*  there began stealing internal documents with the aim of quitting the firm and then bringing this
*  inside information to the Chinese firm, which engine while which was trying to ramp up production
*  of the exact same type of chips in China. And this is a type of chip that Chinese firms have never
*  produced at the cutting edge before. And this was quickly discovered by the company, legal cases were
*  brought. There's very clear evidence, for example, of some of the employees in question typing into
*  their computers, delete Google search records, for example, to try to cover their tracks. So there
*  wasn't much ambiguity as to what top flight espionage, right? Yeah, exactly. How to delete
*  your records. Exactly. So there wasn't much ambiguity as to what was going on. And I think
*  in prior instances, this would have produced the legal dispute or diplomatic discussions,
*  but the legal mechanism simply didn't work. Micron brought a suit against Fujian Jin Hua for stealing
*  intellectual property in China. But in Chinese courts, they actually ruled in favor of the
*  Chinese company against Micron, alleging that Micron had stolen the Chinese company's intellectual
*  property, which was of course a bogus ruling. But for Micron, China was a critical market,
*  because China is the world's largest consumer of chips. And so getting locked out of the Chinese
*  market was a real risk for any chip firm. And it had made them all hesitant to actually take on
*  Chinese companies or the Chinese government when they faced legal issues. And the Trump
*  administration saw this, believed that the previous strategy hadn't really worked, hadn't
*  changed China's behavior. And so had very little faith in any sort of legal or diplomatic mechanism
*  and said, we're going to put Fujian Jin Hua out of business. And via executive order, that's exactly
*  what they did. Do you think they were right? I think they were right. I think that the track
*  record had been that the legal mechanisms had failed to address intellectual property theft.
*  The fact that Chinese courts, despite all the evidence had intervened on behalf of the Chinese
*  firm, suggested that there was really not much hope for legal mechanisms working. And the
*  alternative was just to let intellectual property theft like this keep happening, which doesn't seem
*  to me like a very viable alternative strategy. So you can look at that case as a case of reprisal,
*  we are going to punish you for doing something wrong. And I think that it's a pretty clear cut
*  case that something was being done wrong by China repeatedly there. Then you have Huawei,
*  which is more about not wanting a Chinese company to build the backbone of 5G internet and a lot
*  of telecommunications fears that on the one hand, there was security risks that couldn't be addressed.
*  And even if you could address that, that the dependence on China was a kind of dependence we
*  didn't want. And you can tell me if you think that's an unfair characterization of it. And then under
*  Biden, there's another pretty big step up in these export controls and semiconductor chips,
*  which isn't just that we don't want to be dependent on you. But we actually want to slow down your
*  advance. We don't want you to have a semiconductor industry moving towards equality with ours to say
*  nothing of getting beyond ours. And we're going to weaponize the supply chain to stop that from
*  happening. So can you talk a bit about that change to the Biden administration? Where did they go
*  that the Trump administration had not and why? As you have this escalation in US policy, you also
*  have technology trends developing in important ways that I think are key to understand. And the
*  key shift here is the training of artificial intelligence systems and the realization that
*  training the most advanced AI systems will increasingly require vast volumes of data that
*  grow every single year and therefore cutting edge chips. And so the Biden administration, I think,
*  not only had the concerns of the Trump administration when it came to IP theft or
*  came to China's role in telecom networks, but was also looking at the future of AI and realizing
*  that it was going to be US chips that were going to be training the world's AI systems over the
*  subsequent decade. And that AI systems are going to be even more powerful than people had thought
*  five or 10 years earlier. And so it was hard to predict for them how AI systems would develop,
*  but it seemed inconceivable that they wouldn't have, in addition to transformative economic
*  ramifications, also vast military and intelligence uses. And so given the tremendous growth in AI,
*  plus the reality that training AI required US hardware, to them, I think this looked like a
*  risky moment, actually. If AI was unleashed and the chips that could train AI were unleashed to
*  the entire world, the results would be unpredictable. And so I think in addition to the Trump
*  administration's concerns, they were also looking at these trends saying, we want to have some
*  control over how US chips are used to train AI systems. And that explains why last year they
*  rolled out two different prongs of a new export control regime. The first, which limited the
*  transfer of certain AI training chips to China, made it illegal to transfer NVIDIA GPUs above
*  a certain threshold to China. And then also said, because these chips are so important,
*  we want to make sure that China can't produce them domestically. And so to do that restricted the
*  transfer of any advanced machine tools to China as well. And so this is a very zero sum view of the
*  world that Jake Sullivan as security advisor outlined when these controls were announced.
*  But it's a zero sum view of the world that I think is informed by a lot of concern and uncertainty
*  about how AI systems will be deployed by other countries for military uses and for intelligence
*  gathering. These export rules were announced six months ago. What has their effect been so far in
*  China? We know the effect of the machine tool restrictions, which have caused pretty substantial
*  challenges for Chinese firms at the cutting edge or close to the cutting edge in production,
*  because all of China's leading edge production has required tools from the US, from Japan,
*  from the Netherlands, and those three countries are all implementing roughly similar controls
*  right now. It's harder to say what the impact of the ban on AI chips has been, because China still
*  has a large stock of existing AI chips that it imported before the ban was in place. And so
*  these controls won't begin to have an impact for a couple of years when the rest of the world
*  builds next generation data centers or the generation after that, and China's unable to.
*  And at that point, we will begin, I think, to see some differential open up in terms of the ease of
*  training AI systems in the US or in Europe or in Japan, and the comparative difficulty of doing so
*  with less advanced chips in China. The other side of the Biden administration's thinking on
*  semiconductors has been to build or rebuild American semiconductor manufacturing. So tell
*  me about the chips and sciences act. What does it want? What is it trying to achieve? And what
*  does it actually do? So there's two major facets of the chip and science act. The first puts
*  around $10 billion into R&D spending, which is intended to increase innovation in the chip
*  industry and keep the US at the cutting edge in many different spheres. The second is to
*  provide incentives for firms that open up new manufacturing facilities in the US. And here the
*  goal is to address the fact that it's more expensive to build chip making facilities in the US
*  than it is abroad, 20 or so percent more expensive than in Taiwan or in Korea, which over the last
*  several decades has been one of several factors encouraging companies to build more facilities
*  in other countries rather than in the US. And so the $39 billion in incentives is intended to
*  help companies defray the cost differential and thereby encourage them to build more capacity
*  in the US. Do you think it is likely to succeed in doing that? I think there's no doubt that it
*  will succeed in the short run. If you pay companies to build factories, they're going to build them.
*  That's straightforward. I think the harder challenge is to have an impact after we've spent
*  these first $39 billion of subsidies. I'm skeptical that there will be a second round of chips act
*  spending to defer cost differentials in the future. And so I think the real challenge is
*  to say, can we get the chip industry investing more in the US over the long run, even after we're
*  no longer subsidizing them? And I hope the answer is yes, because I don't think subsidies indefinitely
*  into the future are likely, but it's going to be much more challenging because a lot of the drivers
*  of the cost differential still exist, that labor costs are higher in the US. It's more difficult
*  because of environmental permits, for example, to build facilities in the US. And so we've got to
*  produce an environment that does address some of the cost differential, but also make sure we've
*  got other assets, more productive workers, for example, or closer integration between chips and
*  the software firms that they're serving that make up for the cost differential. And that's an ambitious
*  goal. I think it's a worthwhile goal, but it's far from guaranteed that we're going to achieve it.
*  Well, I've been spending a lot of time looking at the chips act for a big story that I guess
*  will probably be out by the time this publishes. And you and I spoke for this piece, and something
*  that looking through the Notice of Funding Opportunity, which is the publication that
*  explains how the US government is going to evaluate applications for this money. And I think I'm
*  prepared to say, now having spent more time with the document and talking to people that this does
*  not lower the cost differential, it is subsidies, and it has a lot of, I think, good ideas. But aside
*  from funding R&D to try to create innovative breakthroughs, it doesn't lower the cost of what
*  it takes to build or operate fabs or labor or through immigration, bringing in more technicians,
*  it really just doesn't do much to change what it costs to run one of these in America. And in some
*  cases, very arguably, we'll make it higher. They add on a lot of standards, people have talked a
*  lot about insisting that there's high quality childcare in the fabs. But even beyond that,
*  there's just a lot of language about creating pathways for marginalized workers and trying to
*  increase the representation of women in the construction industry. And a lot of these ideas
*  might be good ideas. But if you start from the perspective that US chip manufacturing fell
*  behind, because it's very costly to build and operate factories here, it is very, very, very
*  hard for me to look at this document and say what they're trying to address as a cost differential,
*  they're subsidizing on one side, they're adding a certain number of regulations and standards on
*  the other. But if you're starting from a place where you're already non competitive on cost,
*  I mean, I'm curious if you think I'm being too harsh on this, it just knowing a little bit more
*  now about what has been the problem for American semiconductor manufacturing, it doesn't really
*  look like it has a solution to that problem. Well, I think I would say a couple things in
*  response. I think you're right that in any program like this, there's a risk that it loses focus and
*  that multiple different political interest groups manage to make an imprint on it. And I think keeping
*  focus on the cost differential is going to be a key determinant of success or failure in the long run.
*  I think if you look at what the Commerce Department has said about a lot of the
*  preferences that were on childcare, for example, or around profit sharing, that have been
*  controversial, I think a lot of these end up being preferences rather than requirements.
*  And the Commerce Department, I think, has signaled a willingness to be flexible on some of them. So
*  we'll have to see how exactly they're implemented and how firms decide to deal with them. I think
*  on the permitting question, which I think is really quite important, this is a tricky issue,
*  because it's not just about the federal government, it's also about state and local governments. And
*  so I know the Commerce Department is aware of the importance of this issue, but it's also about
*  making sure that the Arizona State Government and the Portland, Oregon City Council all agree
*  that they're going to approve permits rapidly rather than slow them down because of NIMBYism
*  concerns. And this is a challenge. In Taiwan, TSMC is the island's most prestigious employer.
*  It's the country's largest exporter. And so when it has a request, its request is quickly granted.
*  Whereas in the US, semiconductors are one important industry among many. And so they just get less
*  political priority as a result. And when they face problems, they're solved less quickly
*  for that reason. And so I think we still have a lot more work to do, as you say, to make sure that
*  we're actually taking steps that are addressing the cost differential issues, both at the federal
*  level, but also a lot at state and local levels. And one thing I should say on this is when I spoke
*  with Secretary Gina Raimondo, who runs Commerce, and when we talked about the environmental
*  permitting and talked about the immigration side, she said very clearly on the record,
*  and it'll be in my piece, she would love that. She would love Congress to come to her
*  and do streamlined environmental permitting. She would love Congress to come to her and work with
*  her on easing immigration status for semiconductor technicians. And she also said that she has made
*  clear to governors that if they want a fab, that a grant application from a company where they've
*  partnered with the governor or the mayors or whatever to have permitting sped through will
*  affect what Commerce does. So if you're a governor, and you want this to happen in your state,
*  and you're able to give a company assurances that they can take the Commerce that it will,
*  and that you will have this speedway, they will take that into account. That gets me to one of
*  my final questions here, because I know we're running quite out of time, which is when I read
*  the history of the semiconductor industry in your book, what it seems to me was one of the single
*  most effective things we did was have a fairly open immigration policy during a bunch of these
*  periods that a lot of the industry has its roots in high skilled immigrants to this country,
*  particularly coming out of World War II. And it raises a question as to whether or not one of the
*  best things we can do for this industry and others is actually high skilled immigration or targeted
*  immigration because labor is at such a shortage in sort of skilled semiconductor manufacturing
*  in America. How do you just think about immigration as a technological competitiveness policy?
*  Well, I think that's right. And if you look at the individuals who founded the chip industry in the
*  US, a disproportionate number of them were foreign born, whether it's Andy Grove, the longtime CEO
*  of Intel, born in Hungary, or Morris Chang, who I mentioned who built up chip making in Texas
*  Instruments before he moved to Taiwan. He was born in mainland China. You can go through a lot of the
*  key CEOs and founders of the early chip firms or the CEOs of today's biggest US chip firms,
*  and you'll find a disproportionate number of immigrants there as well. So I think Secretary
*  Armando is right that we ought to have more pathways to have firms bring in the talented
*  engineers that they need. The fact that the industry has a really internationalized supply
*  chain today allows a lot of efficiency, but from the US perspective, it'd be even better to have
*  a less internationalized supply chain if more of those people could move to the US. And many of
*  them would like to, they just can't get the visas or the work permits that they need.
*  I think that is a good place to end. Always a final question. What are three books you'd
*  recommend to the audience? Well, I'd start with The World for Sale, which is an extraordinary
*  account of commodity traders who play an unseen role in the middle of the networks that deliver
*  oil and minerals and metals that we require. It's sort of an eye-opening view as to how all the
*  world's raw materials get shipped around the world. A second book I'd recommend, which takes
*  up on a lot of the discussions we've had about networks, is a book called Nexus by Jonathan
*  Winkler, which is a study of telegraph cables during the early 20th century. And what's striking
*  about it is the extent to which all of the world's governments saw telegraph cables as
*  not only economically important, but also important for military and intelligence uses.
*  And when I think about Huawei today, I think back to the telegraph cables debates of 100 years ago,
*  in some ways, not much has changed. And then a third book, which was published last year,
*  which I strongly recommend, is a book on decision-making in China called Prestige,
*  Manipulation, and Coercion, which is an extraordinary account of high politics in China
*  over the last half century that illustrates with just a really exceptional archival documentation
*  how Chinese politics has shifted and the key drivers in it. And so in my efforts to understand
*  Chinese decision-making around semiconductors, I found the framework that he set out very,
*  very useful to understand how it is that Chinese leaders make decisions.
