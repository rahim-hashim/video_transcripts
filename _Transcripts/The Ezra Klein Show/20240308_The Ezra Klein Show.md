# How America’s Two Abortion Realities Are Clashing
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havKuQY2EvM)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  The Dobbs decision, 2022.
*  The Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.
*  It hands abortion, in theory, back to the states.
*  What would you have thought then, the consequence of that decision on abortion would be now?
*  I read one prediction then, that about 25% of women who needed an abortion would be unable
*  to get one.
*  That seemed plausible to me.
*  But the best estimates we have now suggest the number of abortions in the country, the
*  rate of abortion, has gone slightly up, not down.
*  That's true even though abortion has been harshly criminalized in a number of states.
*  True, even though we've seen court rulings as extreme as the one in Alabama, who just
*  ruled fertilized embryos used in IVF processes are children and must be treated as such.
*  What Dobbs has done is stranger, I think, than what was expected.
*  What it has done is bifurcate America.
*  Red states have sharply constricted access to abortion or tried to.
*  Blue states have sharply expanded access to abortion or tried to.
*  Both sides are trying to enlist the Supreme Court on their side.
*  Both sides are running in 2024 on a promise that if they are given control of the federal
*  government, they will do what the states cannot do and decide the issue nationally in favor
*  of their side.
*  Mary Ziegler is a legal historian and the author of six books about reproductive rights
*  and the law in America.
*  So I've started the show to walk me through all of it.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Mary Ziegler, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So this is something that surprised me that since Dobbs, the data suggests that the number
*  of abortions in America has, if anything, slightly increased.
*  Why would that be?
*  Well, I think it's much easier to ban abortion than it is to enforce a criminal law against
*  abortion.
*  And that's particularly true in 2024, when people can travel across state lines.
*  That distance isn't even very considerable.
*  If you're traveling from St. Louis, Missouri, for example, to East St. Louis, Illinois,
*  that can be a 15 or 20 minute drive.
*  And of course, people can get abortion pills on the internet and self-manage abortions
*  or manage abortions through telehealth.
*  And so I think one of the major challenges for the anti-abortion movement going forward
*  is to figure out what an enforceable abortion ban actually would involve.
*  But I want to hold for a minute on the strangeness of that result.
*  Because I take your point.
*  It's easier to ban abortion than to enforce a ban on abortion.
*  But it does look from early data that if you want to get an abortion in a red state, it
*  has become harder.
*  And many of the people who want that are not able to get it.
*  So a small rise here is interesting.
*  And it suggests an expansion of either abortion access, knowledge of the ways you can get
*  an abortion, something in the states where it is legal and where there have been moves
*  to protect it.
*  So where has the post-Dobbs world turned out very differently than maybe the litigants
*  who wanted Rotafall expected?
*  Failing to convince people that they don't need abortions or even that abortions are
*  wrong also helps to explain why abortions haven't decreased.
*  Abortion rates reflect, I think, both supply and demand, how easy it is to get access to
*  abortion, but also how much people need or want abortion.
*  And of course, Dobbs did nothing to change people's need or want for abortion.
*  If anything, I think the backlash to Dobbs may have made some people feel more comfortable
*  if they've already decided to terminate a pregnancy that they're not doing anything
*  wrong.
*  There are always two arguments in the quest to repeal row.
*  And one argument is that abortion is wrong, and it was wrong for the Supreme Court to
*  make it legal.
*  The other argument is that it was wrong for the Supreme Court to insert itself in this
*  process because this process should naturally be done on the political side of the system.
*  So the decision in Dobbs itself states that, quote, authority to regulate abortion is returned
*  to the people and their elected representatives.
*  And if that was the aim here, you know, you have more restrictive policies in red states,
*  more liberal ones in blue states, some amount of kind of people crossing over or shipping
*  pills from one place to another.
*  You might imagine that working itself out as being fine, sort of even the intended outcome
*  here, right?
*  We just didn't want the courts deciding what you could and couldn't do.
*  I don't get the sense that that is how either side of the coalition sees it, but particularly
*  not the pro-life side.
*  How they experienced this, how they experience both what has been happening sort of in terms
*  of the total abortion rate, but also what has been happening in terms of the question
*  of who should get to decide this and how?
*  Yeah, I think one thing that's important is I think both of these movements really since
*  the 1960s have understood themselves as fighting for fundamental human or constitutional rights.
*  When you hear people talk in either movement, they don't talk as if this is just about what
*  American voters want.
*  They speak as if a higher principle is at stake.
*  So people in the pro-life movement have long said the word person in the Constitution applies
*  from the moment an egg is fertilized.
*  As a result, that person has fundamental rights that abortion takes away.
*  And so I think while Roe was the law, many people in the pro-life movement believed that
*  given a fair chance, Americans would understand what abortion was and they would come to oppose
*  it and vote against it.
*  But underlying that assumption was the basic premise that if Americans didn't come to that
*  conclusion, if they didn't realize that abortion was the human rights tragedy of our generation,
*  ultimately it wouldn't matter, right?
*  That this was still a human rights cause.
*  And that abortion was still wrong.
*  Abortion laws that were liberal were still unconstitutional.
*  That was still the first principle.
*  And I think what we've seen since Dobbs has been that American voters defied what pro-life
*  leaders were predicting and have generally supported abortion rights, including in conservative
*  states like Ohio, at least to a greater degree than people in the pro-life movement would
*  have expected.
*  And I think we've seen pro-life leaders say time and again in response to that, that the
*  principles that they've espoused, right?
*  The personhood and the right to life of the pre-born or unborn child, as they would put
*  it, trumps what voters want, trumps majority rule.
*  In some ways, that isn't a surprise because that was what brought people to the movement
*  in the first place.
*  But we're seeing, I think, that tension play out much more forcefully post-Dobbs because
*  people in the pro-life movement, having been unable to persuade voters or having defined
*  other ways to enforce the policies they're pursuing.
*  There was for a very long time this theory that the Supreme Court, in inserting itself
*  into this issue, had blocked the kind of political process that would have led to natural compromise.
*  But when I look at what you've seen across states, when I look at the blue states that
*  have liberalized access, the red states that have put in various laws and are experimenting
*  with even more to constrict access or criminalize it altogether, I don't really see a process
*  of legislators trying to find the messy median voter in this, trying to find that kind of
*  complex place where the 50th percentile of the electorate actually sits.
*  What I see is political bifurcation, a splitting of the country into a blue America that has
*  a much more expansive right to abortion than it even had under Roe, and a red America that
*  has a, in some cases, unbelievably constricted right.
*  We'll talk about the Alabama IVF ruling.
*  Is that what you see?
*  Is that how you would describe it?
*  No, I think that's right.
*  In some ways, the bifurcation might not surprise us because we see it across a range of issues.
*  But I think what's striking about it is that, especially on the pro-life side, it doesn't
*  really track what voters seem to want.
*  There's a pretty big divergence.
*  And arguably, I think on the pro-choice side too, although the evidence there is less clear,
*  there seems to be sometimes a gap between what voters would prefer and what the parties
*  are pursuing.
*  And that is, I think, raises questions about the health of the democracy, right?
*  If our abortion politics don't reflect our abortion views, what does that tell us about
*  the health of the democracy?
*  And I think that question's been floating around for a while, but it's harder to avoid
*  now that we see these fights playing out in each state after Dobbs.
*  So I want to pick up on that to look at the way in which then the country is bifurcating.
*  And let's begin on the red side.
*  We've seen a number of Republican-led states coming up with a range of strategies, both
*  legal and legislative, to try to make it harder to get an abortion, illegal to get an abortion,
*  make it harder to travel for an abortion.
*  What would you say, as you look across the map, are the broad categories of strategy
*  that have been popular?
*  So I think some of the strategies involve simply tightening state bans.
*  So one trend, for example, is to say red states are no longer going to have exceptions
*  to abortion bans.
*  They're going to have affirmative defenses, meaning if you're a doctor, you actually have
*  to prove you didn't do anything wrong rather than a prosecutor having to prove that you
*  did do something wrong.
*  We've seen red states, too, trying to redefine abortion, the meaning of abortion's shifting.
*  We've seen upwards of 10 states, I think it's 14 or 15, that have changed their definition
*  of abortion in abortion-restrictive states since Dobbs.
*  A lot of the strategies, ironically, also rely on the federal courts.
*  So we've seen abortion opponents turning back to the federal courts, believing that the
*  US Supreme Court will be sympathetic to their cause and seeking to limit, for example, access
*  to Mifepristone, a drug that's used with misoprostol in more than half of all US abortions, by
*  arguing in federal court that the FDA didn't have the authority to approve the drug.
*  We've seen other anti-abortion lawyers trying to revive this 19th century obscenity law
*  called the Comstock Act and repurpose it as a de facto ban on abortions in federal court.
*  And I think that, again, speaks to this feeling that many in the pro-life movement have that
*  what matters is protecting a right to life or what matters is advancing their cause and
*  not necessarily doing so in the most democratic ways possible.
*  And then finally, I think we're beginning to see, this is just starting, efforts to
*  regulate what happens in states where abortion is legal, either by limiting travel or by
*  seeking to apply the laws of red states extra-territorially within the boundaries of blue states, although
*  I think that process is just getting started and is likely to accelerate in the years to
*  come.
*  Let's hold for a minute on the Mifepristone situation, because this is a place where it
*  feels to me that the anti-abortion movement was not quite ready for what it was going
*  to face in a post-op world.
*  And the way I would describe it is that people for a long time thought that this was a political
*  question and they weren't quite prepared for it to have become also a technological question.
*  That previously, if you could ban abortion in a state, then you had to move the person
*  for them to be able to get an abortion because you could just knock out all the providers
*  in the state.
*  And that put a lot of burden of cost, of mobility, et cetera, on the people who might want an
*  abortion.
*  And now you just have to move a pill.
*  And you can move a pill into a state quite easily.
*  And this is a place where blue states have not only liberalized abortion access, but
*  have also made themselves a kind of umbrella of abortion access reaching into red states.
*  So 17 states have created these shield laws to protect providers from having to cooperate
*  with out of state law enforcement.
*  About a half dozen of them or so have made it possible for abortion providers in blue
*  states to run these mail order and telehealth prescription programs where they will send
*  misoppress stone and the subsequent drugs you need to people who need them in red states.
*  And that seems to be a very large part of the reason why the abortion rate, particularly
*  in red states, has not dropped as people might have expected because you can get these pills.
*  Can you talk a bit about how that has shifted the landscape here and a bit about what we
*  are expecting to happen in the court cases around it?
*  Yeah, I think that cutting out access to misoppress stone has become kind of preoccupation for
*  the pro-life movement.
*  And they pursued any number of different strategies to address it.
*  Some of them seem more exotic or even outlandish.
*  You see, for example, the group Students for Life, arguing that misoppress stone is a forever
*  chemical and should be regulated in that way in a restrictive way by the Environmental
*  Protection Agency.
*  What does a forever chemical mean?
*  Well, so this is something that's in more common parlance in the environmentalist world,
*  but right, a chemical that never goes away, that pollutes our groundwater, that jeopardizes
*  the health of future generations.
*  This is an argument, I think, essentially pitched to Gen Z saying misoppress stone is
*  a problem if you care about climate change, if you care about groundwater, if you care
*  about the health of the environment.
*  I don't think necessarily that argument is going to work, but it's just symptomatic of
*  the almost desperation of the pro-life movement in trying to find a strategy that will work
*  with misoppress stone.
*  Court strategies seem more promising in part because the courts are conservative, right?
*  And the pro-life movement just, of course, scored a major victory in Dobs.
*  So the strategy that's before the US Supreme Court now argues essentially that the Food
*  and Drug Administration didn't have the authority to approve misoppress stone way back in 2000
*  under this regulation called Subpart H. And pro-life attorneys argue that's because that
*  regulation applies to diseases and would often require a drug to be more safe than available
*  alternatives.
*  And pro-life attorneys argue that pregnancy is not a disease and that misoppress stone
*  is not safer than alternatives that were available in 2000 like surgical abortion.
*  But the case goes further and says, even if you, the Supreme Court, are not ready to
*  say the FDA didn't have the authority to approve misoppress stone, they're also arguing that
*  the FDA didn't have the authority to lift some of the restrictions on misoppress stone
*  in 2016 and subsequently, right?
*  The lifting of restrictions that made telehealth abortion possible.
*  So it's worth emphasizing that even a kind of modest win in some ways for the pro-life
*  movement could be a big deal.
*  They're also bringing the Comstock Act into this case, arguing that the FDA didn't have
*  the authority to approve telehealth abortion because mailing abortion pills is a crime
*  under federal law, they argue, because of the Comstock Act.
*  So there are a lot of different pretty explosive possibilities on the table when the Supreme
*  Court hears this case, both for misoppress stone, for the kind of precedent this could
*  set for challenging the approval of other drugs that get pulled into the culture wars
*  and potentially for the revival of the Comstock Act.
*  And just to say a word on the Comstock Act, this is an old law not thought about that
*  often in modern times that criminalizes the mailing of certain kinds of materials that
*  are considered lewd, vile, that kind of thing.
*  I understand it primarily as an anti-pornography law, but the idea is you can have a unusual
*  expansion of it to basically saying misoppress stone and things like that are indecent.
*  That's right.
*  So the Comstock Act was first passed in 1873 as an obscenity law.
*  The preoccupation of the people who passed the law was clearly illicit sex.
*  So it bars the mailing of any number of items deemed obscene, including items that the law
*  describes as for indecent or immoral use, including items intended, designed or adapted
*  for abortion.
*  So the law hasn't been much enforced at all in the past century.
*  And to the extent it has, it's been enforced primarily in cases involving pornography.
*  But pro-life lawyers point to this language of the statute and say, to begin with, that
*  you can't mail abortion pills because of the Comstock Act, notwithstanding what federal
*  courts have said about the meaning of the statute.
*  And second, some of them argue that it's a ban on all abortions because they argue there
*  is no abortion, surgical, medical or otherwise in the United States that takes place without
*  an item placed in the mail.
*  That interpretation in some ways is before the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  And we may or may not hear about what they think about it by the end of June.
*  There's a way in which the pro-life movement right now is very explicit in interviews about
*  saying the best thing for us is to take a more moderate national position, try to make
*  the argument that Democrats are now promoting or backing an unlimited right to abortion.
*  But we're where the people are and we're open to 10 week, 14 week, even 16 week.
*  And at the same time, what's happening in red states is often almost deliriously extreme
*  that it doesn't really make that kind of repositioning very easy.
*  So you have these red states that have really wrapped themselves around an axle of being
*  unable to even uphold basic life and health of the mother exceptions.
*  You see terrible stories of people who want children, who don't want to have an abortion,
*  but who suffer life threatening complications, not being able to get care until the absolute
*  last minute and ending up in critical care because of it.
*  You have this very strange ruling in Alabama, which decided that embryos from IVF are children.
*  How do you think about that where a lot of these red states, given the choice between
*  these more politically palatable rules and having, I think what you might call a more
*  embrace of fetal personhood as a goal and as a policy approach, have been choosing the
*  fetal personhood approach despite the fact that it's causing huge, huge, huge political
*  problems for the broader movement?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think this is an example of how the incentives for the pro-life movement and
*  for Republicans in politically uncompetitive states like Alabama just don't align with
*  the incentives for Republicans in politically competitive races.
*  The pro-life movement at the moment, I think, is becoming disillusioned with voters and
*  convinced that voters are not willing to do the right thing when it comes to protecting
*  the right to life and that therefore the movement needs to find ways to bypass voters.
*  State legislators and state Supreme Court justices may actually benefit politically
*  from doing some of the things that play so poorly at the national level, right?
*  So in Texas, when Kate Cox was pursuing an abortion in a case where her health was threatened
*  and she realized that a child she desperately wanted had a condition that was likely to
*  be fatal in the first year after birth.
*  Sorry.
*  I'm about to miss it.
*  Texas officials not only denied her the ability to have an abortion, but presented her as
*  a liar and threatened hospitals that would have even considered treating her even when
*  she temporarily had a court order permitting an abortion.
*  And I think the reason that's happening is because in Texas that kind of decision may
*  not play as poorly.
*  So part of what I think is problematic for Republicans at the national level is that
*  their allies in the pro-life movement and their counterparts in the states aren't on
*  the same page necessarily about either what the right thing to do is or I think more importantly
*  what the politically advantageous thing to do is, which has put Republicans even more,
*  I think, between a rock and a hard place than they otherwise would be post-Obs.
*  Why do red states or so many red states have such narrow exemptions for the life of the mother?
*  There are two reasons red states have narrow exemptions.
*  I think first there's been a kind of growing consensus among pro-life groups that any life-saving
*  procedure just isn't an abortion in the first place, right?
*  They'll call it maternal-fetal separation or something of the kind.
*  So the idea is that abortions that are presented as life-saving either are not abortions or
*  are simply pretext for abortion that's elective.
*  The second reason I think is that there's a fundamental distrust of doctors and to a
*  lesser extent patients that you see cutting across not just life exceptions but health
*  exceptions and even exceptions for sexual assault.
*  Again, the idea being that what people who support reproductive rights want is not narrow
*  access to abortion.
*  They want access to abortion that's broad.
*  And so any exception will become the exception that swallows the rule.
*  So then you'll see conservative lawmakers trying to craft exceptions to preclude that
*  from happening to prevent what they see as the abuse of exceptions.
*  So the fundamental concern often in the way exceptions are drafted is not ensuring that
*  deserving people as legislators would see it can use the exceptions.
*  It's primarily to ensure that people who are not deserving in their eyes cannot.
*  And that's part of why you see state exceptions drawn up the way they are.
*  But are these ideas popular even in red states?
*  And I say that it's an actual question.
*  I genuinely don't know.
*  Is what just happened in Alabama where they say that these fertilized embryos are children?
*  I mean, there's a, I thought a very moving comment in one of the news stories I read
*  where a woman who was undergoing IVF said, I have three embryos.
*  I don't have three children.
*  Like I know many people with embryos and they don't have children.
*  It's a very hard and difficult process.
*  Some of the stories have come out of Texas around health of the mother exemptions.
*  They're really brutal.
*  Do these reflect the politics in these states?
*  Because we have seen in a bunch of them, Kansas being I think a big example, but Ohio being
*  another, we have seen in states that are now understood as comfortably quite Republican
*  that when abortion rights are put directly on the ballot, not done through representative
*  democracy, you know, like legislators and governors, but done through ballot initiatives
*  that they seem to be winning despite the partisan lean of the state.
*  Yeah, I don't think they reflect what voters want.
*  I think they instead reflect the fact that these are states where politicians don't have
*  to worry about political competition.
*  So if you're a legislator or a judge in Alabama, if you're a legislator, you're worrying about
*  a primary challenge from your right.
*  You're not worried for the most part about losing to a Democrat in a general election.
*  And you're not worried that voters are going to turn you out of office if you take a brutal
*  or unforgiving position on access to care in cases of threats to life or health.
*  That's just not a realistic problem for you.
*  So you're going to be thinking more about what donors want, what base voters want, what
*  potentially primary voters want.
*  And so we have a dynamic where in large swaths of the country where bans are in place, politicians
*  don't feel accountable to the median voter in the way that we might expect.
*  And so see it as politically advantageous to pursue policies that are unpopular, even
*  I think in extreme cases, policies that prevent voters from weighing in altogether.
*  I mean, some of the really striking examples, again, we saw this in Ohio and we see it elsewhere,
*  involve Republicans trying to make it harder for voters to even begin ballot initiative
*  processes, which were unsurprisingly almost always unpopular, right?
*  If you ask voters if voters want to have less power, the answer is usually no.
*  But I think, again, the reason Republicans can pursue that kind of strategy is because
*  they know that even if voters reject the strategy, they're unlikely to award Democrats a majority
*  in some of these states.
*  Nevertheless, because polarization is so deep, because states are so gerrymandered, that's
*  really the dynamic.
*  It's not a question of whether there are voters in red states who support everything that's
*  going on.
*  I mean, the IVF example is a particularly potent one.
*  I've seen poll numbers suggesting that between 80 and 85% of Americans support access to
*  IVF.
*  And we've seen legislators in Alabama bending over backwards to try to do something to address
*  the consequences of the court's ruling.
*  But I think even if they didn't, I'm not sure that Alabama would see any kind of significant
*  change as to who controls it politically.
*  How much does the porousness of borders on this that we were talking about earlier, the
*  availability of Miffy Prestone, the ability to travel, how much does that make this divergence
*  from the median voter or even the minority voter in a lot of these states possible?
*  And I'm thinking here of places like Texas, which, you know, when we talk about Texas
*  politically, we think big red state.
*  But you look at Texas, right?
*  And there are a lot of, forget Democrats, just people who want access to reproductive
*  rights there.
*  You think that Austin and the people and the companies located there, which is a very important
*  engine of the tax and economy, Houston, Dallas, you think about Florida, where they've passed
*  a very, very sharp ban that is under a court conflict now.
*  But you think about the people who live in Miami, who live in Jacksonville, who live
*  in Tampa, right?
*  I mean, that's important to the Florida economy.
*  It is important to who is in Florida.
*  But in a world where the right got its wish, and you really shut down access to Miffy Prestone,
*  the ability to leave the state if you need an abortion.
*  And then I wonder what it looks like to be in these states if you're a woman or a couple
*  of childbearing age, and you face these kinds of dangers if you get pregnant or you end
*  up in a medically dangerous pregnancy.
*  My wife and I have two children.
*  My wife's pregnancies, and she's written about this at the Atlantic, were extraordinarily
*  dangerous such that it would not be medically safe for her to be pregnant again, which is
*  a tragedy in our house.
*  But if something happened, right, it is not safe, but it is not clear.
*  And again, she's written about this.
*  So I'm not speaking out of turn.
*  It is not clear that it would be legal within these states.
*  It almost certainly wouldn't be for her to seek care if she were in that situation, because
*  when does unsafe become actually a threat to her life, right?
*  When does it pass that space and the providers don't feel they'll be prosecuted?
*  So how much does the extremism here actually rely on the loopholes and the porousness of
*  the borders and the outs that blue states have actually offered?
*  I think it does both in red states and even vis-à-vis how much of a backlash there is
*  in blue states.
*  And we've already seen a pretty tremendous backlash to daubs.
*  But I think the reason reproductive rights aren't an even more important political issue
*  is because both travel and Mifflipristone have been sort of safety valves for people
*  who want to terminate pregnancies and can't do so legally in their own states.
*  You can imagine if those borders were no longer porous, sentiment in red states would shift
*  even more.
*  We've seen polling already indicating a shift in terms of more opposition to abortion restrictions
*  in states where they're actually in force rather than in places where they remain abstractions.
*  And I think that dynamic would be amplified even at the national level.
*  You can imagine the degree of backlash if there was no option to get illegal abortion
*  in New York or California, right?
*  If the only way to achieve illegal abortion was to travel outside of the United States
*  altogether.
*  I think the kinds of efforts we see now proceed by the pro-life movement would be unpopular
*  in a way that's pretty unimaginable now.
*  Let's talk a bit about how the laws have changed in blue states.
*  What have been the dominant strategies?
*  How has what is happening in blue states or what is illegal in blue states changed since
*  you know 2016, 2018, 2020?
*  So I think the changes we've seen in blue states fall into a few different categories.
*  So some blue states have lifted restrictions that were in place, for example, on who could
*  perform an abortion.
*  So you've seen blue states try to expand the universe of potential abortion providers.
*  And at the same time, I think through doing things like funding abortion funds, which
*  help pay for travel and other things that low income people need when pursuing abortion,
*  we've seen blue states introduce ballot initiatives.
*  So essentially elevating protections for reproductive rights from the level of state statute, say,
*  to the state constitution, which we've already seen in places like California and Vermont.
*  And we see several other blue states pursuing in potentially in 2024.
*  And then, you know, as you've been mentioning, we've also seen a lot of different varieties
*  of shield laws, for example, limits on cooperation with subpoenas or extradition requests.
*  I will be issuing an executive order to the Washington State Patrol not to cooperate in
*  investigations of other states that would violate the Roe v. Wade decision.
*  We can share the freedoms that we take for granted here in New York with women all across
*  this country.
*  These laws will make New Jersey a beacon of freedom for every American woman.
*  And these kind of run the gamut from things that are less legally complicated, like shield
*  laws that apply to doctors and others who are operating in states where abortion is
*  legal to things that are more legally complex, like shield laws that apply when people are
*  mailing pills to states where abortion is criminal.
*  Is there a way in which Republicans have a point on this?
*  If you imagine this going the other direction, you think about California, where they have
*  criminalized, outlawed all kinds of products they think of as environmentally problematic
*  over time.
*  They want to get rid of all cars with internal combustion engines.
*  But you can imagine all kinds of things that maybe they said, we don't like the chemicals
*  in this.
*  We think this is needlessly polluting to the atmosphere.
*  We think this is bad for climate.
*  And I think people in California would not want Red States Assembly begin shipping cars
*  with fuel standards that don't meet the California standards.
*  And California would take that to the court and try to argue it down.
*  So even if you support abortion rights, is there a way in which the right has a point
*  on this, this direct intervention through these shield laws to circumvent the laws being
*  made in Republican states?
*  Is that unconstitutional or does that raise some kind of bigger problem that liberals
*  would identify in another context?
*  I think it might.
*  I think the real answer in terms of the constitutionality is we just don't know because we're seeing,
*  I think, frankly, from conservative and progressive states moves to sort of project power outside
*  of their borders in ways we really haven't seen in a really long time.
*  It's even the question of whose laws apply, right?
*  If California says we think our laws apply because it was our doctor mailing the pills
*  and we think this abortion is legal, Alabama might say we think our laws apply because
*  it was our citizen and the abortion happened in Alabama.
*  How do you even resolve that question is not really clear.
*  I think it's fair to say that while shield laws certainly are probably the best blue
*  states can do to protect doctors and others from legal liability, they are not really
*  a shield, right?
*  They're not some kind of fail safe protection.
*  And that the closest thing really we have to civil disobedience post-ops is doctors
*  who are taking the riskiest decisions under shield laws, knowing full well that they're
*  operating in a legal gray area.
*  And it's a pretty big mess because it's not just states with shield laws that are doing
*  this.
*  So I think we've seen another state, Missouri, essentially suing a Planned Parenthood, seeking
*  an injunction against Planned Parenthood in the state, claiming in part that Planned Parenthood
*  was breaking the law by assisting minors to travel out of state to places where abortion
*  was legal.
*  This is yet another example, I think, of the idea that it was extremely naive, if not dishonest
*  for the Supreme Court to say, removing Roe from the equation will cause things to simmer
*  down and facilitate compromises.
*  Because one of the new battlefields, of course, that's emerged is this question of how do
*  we resolve these conflicts of law when both states claim the power to resolve the question?
*  And how do we resolve the constitutional questions at stake when you are talking about regulating
*  people's speech, regulating people's travel, and just basic questions of fundamental fairness
*  when no one knows ahead of time whose law is even going to control the situation?
*  Are there good analogies to this kind of thing?
*  One of the possible ones that came to me was there's been a period of strong liberalization
*  of marijuana laws, despite the fact that marijuana remained federally scheduled as an illegal
*  and highly controlled substance.
*  And in the end, it doesn't look like there's been a big federal state problem over that.
*  But is there something this looks like in recent American history?
*  Not really, no.
*  I mean, I think I thought of the marijuana example, too.
*  But to your point, there hasn't really been a muscular federal effort to try to stamp
*  out state laws that take a more liberal position on marijuana, nor have there really been interstate
*  conflicts, right?
*  Where you see California or New York with Shiel laws saying, we can protect our people,
*  even if they're mailing pills to your state.
*  And you conversely have, you know, attorneys general in places like Idaho and Alabama saying,
*  we can prosecute you if you help someone travel to a state where abortion is legal.
*  This sort of conflicts between states, between state and federal government being this high
*  stakes and this visible, I haven't seen another example of in contemporary US history.
*  There had been for some time a very strong effort in the red states before the Dobbs
*  decision to constrict access by basically making it impossible to be an abortion provider.
*  Like you said right at the beginning, there's a supply and demand side of this.
*  Can you talk about the ways in which blue states have been trying to change the supply?
*  Yeah, I think blue states have been trying to change the supply, I think in ways both
*  practical and symbolic.
*  So for really decades, there have been concerns about shortages of abortion providers, in
*  part because of fears of high insurance rates or legal liability, at least nuisance lawsuits,
*  fears of violence or damage to clinics, or even, you know, fears caused by the murder
*  of physicians in the past.
*  There's been longstanding concerns of what's called, you know, the graying of the profession,
*  right?
*  Blue perform abortions have been performing abortions for a long time and are older.
*  I think you've seen blue states try to de-stigmatize the provision of abortion, essentially to
*  say not only are we going to make it possible for more people to perform abortions, we want
*  physicians to feel that what they're doing, if they're performing abortions or other healthcare
*  providers, isn't something that is wrong or deserving of shame or even viewed as a problem
*  in this state.
*  I think you've seen that push much more visibly since Dobs, even though I think these concerns
*  about the graying of the profession are much longer standing.
*  I want to spend a moment on that because I do think culture matters here.
*  And when you think about the sweep of abortion politics and culture on the democratic side,
*  I think it's very striking.
*  Joe Biden, who many now know as a very pro-abortion rights president, when the original road decision
*  comes down, he opposes it.
*  He is a Catholic Democrat who says this is a very, very hard issue for him that he is
*  personally pro-life.
*  Over the course of his career, he evolves on that.
*  But you think about the Bill Clinton presidency with the idea that abortion should be safe,
*  legal and rare.
*  It was sort of the democratic consensus might be a strong word, but certainly it's political
*  positioning, the party's political positioning to say that abortion should be something you
*  can get, but sort of should not feel good about, right?
*  We want as few of them as possible.
*  And now, I think that Democrats are much more comfortable with the idea that abortion is
*  a choice that makes sense when people choose it, right?
*  That there's a lot less discomfort with it than I feel like there was even 15 or 20 years
*  ago in democratic politics.
*  And that also probably changes how people feel about getting into the work, how people
*  feel about going to get an abortion.
*  Do you think this is significant in terms of outcome or do you think it's all symbolic?
*  No, I think it could be significant, especially because there's some signs that maybe it's
*  a generational shift that younger Americans who tend to be more progressive on a variety
*  of issues related to, you know, really race, sexuality and abortion too, may feel more
*  strongly about this.
*  And that's not surprising because in the past decade or so, we've seen the advent of abortion
*  storytelling, right?
*  Where people who've experienced abortion really detail their stories in ways that are destigmatizing.
*  We've seen an attack on things like the Hyde Amendment, which bans Medicaid reimbursement
*  for abortion was long a subject of bipartisan agreement, has now become a target for Democrats.
*  And you've seen too, I think, the idea that abortion is not a standalone issue for Democrats
*  as part of what they would call a reproductive justice agenda that includes things like IVF,
*  contraception, child care, the means to raise children in a healthy environment.
*  And I think all of that has helped to destigmatize the issue for Democrats.
*  And destigmatizing it is significant, I think, both in the sense that people who have abortions
*  often behave differently when they think that they'll be condemned for doing so.
*  And I think it may affect who's willing to perform abortions in the first place and what
*  kinds of legal risks they're willing to incur.
*  It's also, I think, significant on access to abortion later in pregnancy, particularly
*  when so many of the stories we've been hearing about people with wanted pregnancies who are
*  experiencing stillbirth or miscarriage and often life-threatening consequences are thinking
*  about ending those pregnancies or already have non-viable pregnancies quite late in
*  the game, right?
*  Often past week 12.
*  And you're seeing, I think, stigma decline because of that too, because there are real
*  stories being told about who's having abortions late in pregnancy.
*  I cannot adequately put into words the trauma and despair that comes with waiting to either
*  lose your own life, your child's, or both.
*  For days I was locked in this bizarre and avoidable hell.
*  Would Willow's heart stop or would I deteriorate to the brink of death?
*  That kind of storytelling, I think, changes how people view the law, sometimes changes
*  how they vote.
*  So I don't think you can underestimate the importance of that.
*  You really do see that in polling right now.
*  So there was a November poll by the Wall Street Journal and NORC, which found that 55% of
*  respondents said it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion
*  if she wants it for any reason.
*  And that question is important.
*  They've been tracking that since the 70s, and that is the highest it has ever been.
*  So there has been some kind of public opinion change here, where it isn't just that people
*  or it isn't just that people don't like what they see happening in red states, but their
*  actual level of support for a woman's right to pursue an abortion based on their own estimation
*  of the circumstance has gone significantly up.
*  I think that's right.
*  And I think part of that is attributable to the fact that people are now experiencing
*  the reality of the United States without a right to choose abortion.
*  So prior to DOBS, I think people's experience of this question really involved abstractions,
*  right?
*  Are you pro-life?
*  Are you pro-choice?
*  Are you for a right to life?
*  Are you for a right to choose?
*  Hypothetically, in an alternative universe where abortion could be criminalized under
*  all or most circumstances, do you think that would be a good idea?
*  But nobody really saw in tangible terms what that meant, what that meant for people who
*  were seeking abortion and frankly for people who weren't seeking abortion, right?
*  People who were experiencing miscarriage or stillbirth, maybe people who are pursuing
*  IVF.
*  And so I think the reality of how a ban would be implemented, what that means in practical
*  terms, has probably changed some people's minds.
*  What federal legislation have Democrats rallied around and what federal legislation have Republicans
*  rallied around?
*  Well, we have federal legislation, which I think in both cases is very unlikely to go
*  anywhere.
*  Democrats really pre and post DOBS have been rallying around a law called the Women's Health
*  Protection Act that would rule out a variety of abortion restrictions and bans.
*  Historically, you would have seen anti-abortion groups rallying around a life at conception
*  act that recognized rights or personhood is beginning at conception, or maybe a federal
*  six week ban or a federal 15 week ban, which Lindsey Graham had floated at various points,
*  or a federal 20 week ban.
*  I don't think that the energy on the pro-life side is really in Congress at all.
*  I don't think there's a lot of faith that Congress can do anything.
*  And I think that's true on the progressive side of things as well.
*  So I think while there are these pieces of legislation that both sides have embraced,
*  they primarily operate as symbols right now, not as laws that I think anyone imagines going
*  anywhere in the near term.
*  One reason I think that's true is that any law you can really imagine here is subject
*  to the filibuster.
*  You can't do a big abortion bill through budget reconciliation because it's not a budget bill.
*  And so nobody's going to have 60 votes on anything like this.
*  Something you will hear from the anti-abortion side is that the law that Democrats have rallied
*  around to the extent they have a symbolic piece of legislation that Joe Biden has endorsed,
*  that Chuck Schumer has endorsed, that Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed, that is far more expansive
*  than the pre-daubed status quo, that it goes much further than Roe does.
*  And that compared to a lot of the bills that Republicans might rally around, if Trump does
*  endorse a 16 week bill, things like that, that it puts Democrats out of step with public
*  opinion in a way that Republicans are embracing more compromised legislation.
*  And that is the big opportunity for Republicans politically here.
*  Is there something to that argument in your view?
*  Like substantively does what Democrats want to pass go far beyond Roe and politically
*  does that create a problem for them?
*  There's a possibility certainly that Democrats are more progressive on reproductive rights
*  than American voters are.
*  I think polling on some of this has been a little murkier post-Dobbs, for example, on
*  what Americans feel about abortion after 12 or 15 weeks.
*  I think really the challenge for Republicans and why that isn't a winning argument.
*  And we have seen some evidence that it may not be a winning argument when Glenn
*  Youngkin brought this up as a potential winning strategy and trying to help his party take
*  control of the Virginia state legislature.
*  A new $1.4 million dollar ad buy from Governor Glenn Youngkin's political action committee
*  is trying to change the narrative on abortion rights.
*  Here's the truth.
*  There is no ban.
*  Virginia Republicans support a reasonable 15 week limit with exceptions for rape, incest
*  and life of the mother.
*  It's because it's unclear to voters where the Republican Party is on this.
*  Because at the same time that you have some national Republicans saying we're willing
*  to embrace a ban at 12 or 15 or 16 weeks, you have pro-life groups and state lawmakers
*  saying that's not nearly enough and we need to tighten the bans that begin at fertilization
*  that we already have or that any law that permits abortion past a certain point violates
*  the constitutional rights of the fetus or unborn child.
*  So I think voters in Virginia were unsure whether whatever stopping point Republicans
*  were proposing was real or whether it was in fact a kind of step toward a more absolute
*  ban.
*  You saw some of this in Ohio with voters who are somewhat conservative.
*  They felt that their options were really between an absolute ban or a sweeping protection for
*  And while they might not have been entirely comfortable with either of those options,
*  they were far more comfortable with the sweeping protection for abortion rights.
*  And that I think is the problem for Republicans that they may not be able to establish with
*  voters that they're actually willing to stop at whatever point they're presenting as the
*  kind of consensus solution.
*  I don't know if anyone believes that in part because the Republican Party is aligned with
*  the pro-life movement and the pro-life movement is vocally not willing to stop at that point.
*  So there's been a lot of reporting about Donald Trump saying privately at least that
*  he thinks maybe he would endorse or he would support a 16 week abortion ban, which is more
*  moderate than what a lot of Republican states have done, more moderate than what a lot of
*  Republicans have done, would be understood, I think, as him sort of moving to his party's
*  almost left on the issue.
*  But even if that were true and he has not come out and done that, there's still a tremendous
*  amount a Trump administration could do that would sharply constrict abortion access even
*  if his stated position was a 16 week ban.
*  So I was reading the Mandate for Leadership, which is this big long document released by
*  the Heritage Foundation that is understood widely given who has written it as a kind
*  of guide to how a Trump administration might govern if it comes back into power in 2025.
*  When you look at the section on the Health and Human Services Department, it begins by
*  saying that under Trump, HHS was dedicated to serving quote, all Americans from conception
*  to natural death.
*  It goes on to say the goal number one is protecting life and the Secretary should pursue a robust
*  agenda to protect the fundamental right to life.
*  It goes on to say abortion pills pose a single greatest threat to unborn children in a post
*  real world.
*  It says the FDA should therefore reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because
*  politicized approval process was illegal from the start.
*  It goes on to offer a bunch of other ways it can constrict that.
*  And so you could very much imagine a scenario in which Donald Trump is running for office
*  on something that gets reported as a more compromised position, right?
*  The kind of thing that people were assuming might happen if the Supreme Court got rid
*  of Roe.
*  But actually in office through the administrative state, what is happening is a very, very sharp
*  constriction from where we are now using rulemaking and agency authority like that.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what I think you see pro-life leaders expecting, right?
*  And ironically, expecting very publicly in the pages of the Washington Post and New York
*  Times, right?
*  So Roger Severino, who served in the first Trump administration in a special department
*  of HHS, has told the Washington Post that he fully expects Trump to use executive power
*  to limit access to Mifepristone.
*  It's interesting too that we're hearing this not just from Roger Severino, but from people
*  like Gene Hamilton, who is one of the authors of the mandate for leadership.
*  Hamilton isn't even really a pro-life figure.
*  He's best known as Stephen Miller's number two in the family separation policy and architect
*  of immigration policy in the first Trump administration.
*  But he too has outlined similar plans for limiting access to pills and reviving the
*  Comstock Act that would primarily rely on who is going to be the secretary of health
*  and human services, who's going to be in the Department of Justice, who is going to be
*  in the FDA rather than who's going to be in Congress or what voters think.
*  And so quite clearly those are the plans the pro-life movement has in mind.
*  And they're quite clearly hoping as Jonathan Mitchell, who represented Trump in one of
*  disqualification cases from Colorado before the Supreme Court said, I think some of the
*  pro-life movement are hoping that Trump doesn't say anything about this until after the election,
*  because the idea that he would prefer a 16-week ban I think is a lot more politically palatable
*  than some of these potential exercises of executive power that are on the table.
*  And the question of whether they're politically realistic is an interesting one too.
*  I think some people have pointed to the fact that Trump blames the abortion issue for midterm
*  losses for Republicans, essentially suggesting that it's not his fault or it's not because
*  of his unpopularity.
*  It's because of the position the GOP has staked out on abortion, that Trump is in fact more
*  moderate than his party on abortion.
*  And that may or may not be true, but the sort of interesting question is how differently
*  Trump would think or act if he can no longer run for reelection, right?
*  And what are the incentives or the incentives to please the base and explore some of these
*  uses of executive power and of the administrative state?
*  Or is it to sort of tack more to the center to please the median voter?
*  And I don't think you can safely assume that Trump would want to please the median voter
*  when he's thinking about his post-presidential future rather than his reelection chances.
*  And honestly, how much he would even care or know about what is happening in his own
*  administrative state.
*  I mean, it has not been a hallmark of Trumpian governance to have a very deep personal involvement
*  in the rulemaking happening across the agencies.
*  And I think the whole theory of these people in the second Trump administration is you
*  have a much more aligned Trumpist conservative cohort coming to the agencies with a plan
*  from the beginning.
*  And so you have a kind of all front attack right at the launch that gets a lot more done.
*  What Donald Trump thinks about some of this, I think it's actually never been a very good
*  guide to what will happen.
*  And then what could a Biden administration do, right?
*  It's not that compelling a pitch to say, elect us and we will try and fail to pass this piece
*  of legislation.
*  But presumably they've done a lot of what they can do administratively.
*  I mean, they've been very, very upset about Dobbs and have been very clear on which side
*  of the divide they fall on.
*  So are there major moves they've made that the dangers they would be unmade or there
*  are major moves they have not made that they could if they came back into power?
*  Like, how do you see the substantive questions here of who wins in 2024?
*  So I think there are some limits on what the Biden administration can do to advance reproductive
*  rights, in other words, to go kind of past where we are now, in part because the US Supreme
*  Court is conservative and in part because the filibuster has kind of rendered Congress
*  kind of useless in this regard.
*  But the Biden administration, I think, is still kind of potentially a firewall in terms
*  of what the US Supreme Court may do.
*  You'll hear suggestions that, for example, there's still unnecessary restrictions on
*  Mifflipristan that the FDA could and should revisit those.
*  And there may be steps like that taken in a second Biden administration.
*  But I think that the difference in terms of the potential options for Trump is that Trump
*  would more likely be aligned with the conservative Supreme Court, obviously, than the Biden administration
*  would.
*  So I think Trump might be more aggressive in trying to use the administrative state,
*  believing that the Supreme Court would be less likely to stop him than Biden might be.
*  But I think in both cases, what you're really looking at is how executive power could facilitate
*  outcomes that the Supreme Court is going to dictate or could block outcomes the Supreme
*  Court is going to dictate.
*  I wonder if when you peer into the midst of the future, you see any path towards any kind
*  of stable equilibrium here.
*  This is by no means a perfect analogy.
*  But I was thinking, as we were talking about this, about the Vertebral Care Act, which
*  passes in 2010, is the subject of incredibly heated legislation, right?
*  Various efforts to get it ruled unconstitutional based on the individual mandate, based on
*  different kinds of administrative powers.
*  There's then a series of efforts to gut it or repeal it legislatively.
*  They fail.
*  But there are efforts that work to trim it, right?
*  They kill off the individual mandate through statute.
*  They change this thing called the Cadillac tax.
*  Kind of eventually, it sort of drains out and people settle into a not super happy,
*  but nevertheless a kind of equilibrium on something that was so dominant in American
*  public policy and politics for really over 10 years.
*  Do you see anything like that here?
*  I mean, do you understand this as a moment of kind of maximum furor and then some things
*  that are going to get worked out and will have a kind of steady state that looks a little
*  bit like X or is that not how you imagine this going?
*  On the one hand, I'd like to imagine that's possible because I think there are a lot of
*  areas of common ground for most Americans who obviously support access to abortion early
*  in pregnancy, obviously are concerned about how pregnant people are treated in various
*  ways beyond the abortion context, obviously support access to IVF.
*  So I mean, it's not hard to imagine what a policy could look like that most Americans
*  would support.
*  I think the problem in part is that the polarization of this issue always went well beyond Roe.
*  It had to do with how this issue has become yoked to partisan politics.
*  It has to do with the fact that the movements contesting this issue see themselves as fighting
*  for human rights that are more important than the will of the people.
*  Those features of the debate tend to fuel these cycles of outrage and tend to destabilize
*  solutions that people would find appealing.
*  And that's even more true in a nation that's as divided as ours is.
*  And it's more problematic still, I think, because the inability of politicians to solve
*  this problem has a lot to do with the health or lack thereof of the democracy and the fact
*  that politicians can pursue policies that voters don't like when it comes to reproductive
*  rights without fear of losing their jobs.
*  So it's imaginable to me that there could be a stable solution, but I think it would
*  require more than just votes.
*  I think it would require creating a more accountable democracy.
*  It would require changes to things like voting rights or even campaign finance.
*  And so it's possible, but I mean, it may be a little utopian.
*  But I think that at the same time, if that's what it takes, that's really what you're talking
*  about.
*  If you're talking about a reproductive rights agenda, you're not just talking about what
*  the law says about contraception, IVF abortion.
*  You're talking about what the law says about things like the right to vote, too.
*  And then also final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  I would recommend Josh Prager's The Family Row in part because it speaks to how complicated
*  this issue is in the lived experiences of Americans.
*  I think it's easy at times to get caught up in the law and politics of this and not see
*  the people who live the stories.
*  And that book, I think, really beautifully illustrates that.
*  Another important book just for understanding, there are two books I think it's important
*  and helpful to read together.
*  Jennifer Holland did a book called Tiny You, A Western History of the Anti-Abortion, and
*  Daniel K. Williams did a book called Defenders of the Unborn.
*  These books tell very different stories about the origins of the anti-abortion or pro-life
*  And I think reading them together is a pretty bracing and provocative experience and I think
*  an important one given where we are in abortion politics.
*  And I also really love a book called Before Roe v. Wade that was put together by Linda
*  Greenhouse and Reva Siegel.
*  And it's primarily a kind of polyphonic collection of primary source documents from before Roe
*  came down.
*  And I think that's a really important thing to experience now too, to hear the voices
*  of the people who have been involved in this struggle in their own words rather than to
*  hear them channeled by a historian like me.
*  That also helps, I think, make clear how high the stakes have felt for people on either
*  side of this issue really from the very beginning, from even the years before Roe was the law.
