# Hereâ€™s How an Open Democratic Convention Would Work
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-yMMSZDOI)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So last week on the show, I made the argument that Democrats should pick a candidate at
*  the convention this year, that Joe Biden is capable of doing the job of president,
*  but that his campaign is not going well.
*  That it is not clear to me, at least that he is capable of running successfully for
*  president. This is a way political parties throughout most of American history have
*  picked their nominees for president.
*  But it's a funny kind of suggestion because it is somehow simultaneously novel and
*  ancient. So what I wanted to do today was talk through how conventions work, how
*  an open convention works, what kind of politicking happens at it, what kinds of
*  candidates win, how they win, and also talk through what would happen this year.
*  I mean, what if Biden dropped out in April?
*  What if he dropped out in July or August?
*  How does that change it? What happens if he drops out before delegates are selected?
*  What happens if after?
*  All these things create very different dynamics.
*  Elaine K.
*  Mark has literally written the book on presidential primaries.
*  It's called Primary Politics, Everything You Need to Know About How America
*  Nominates Its Presidential Candidates.
*  She's a senior fellow in governance studies and the director of the Center for
*  Effective Public Management at Brookings.
*  But she has also been in the room where all this happens.
*  She's worked on four presidential campaigns, on 10 nominating conventions, both for
*  Democrats and Republicans.
*  She was on the DNC Rules Committee for many years.
*  She's been a super delegate to five Democratic conventions.
*  So she both has the theory and the history, but the actual felt experience of what it
*  is like when you are figuring out these rules and trying to work within them.
*  As always, my email, azraklineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Elaine K.
*  Mark, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  I want to begin with something that you've said before, which is that selecting a
*  nominee is a process, not an event.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Well, there's two stages to picking a president, right?
*  One is the primaries.
*  And second is actually choosing the delegates.
*  So the primaries allocate the delegates.
*  The winner of the primary gets five delegates from this state.
*  The actual people who are chosen as those five people are not picked until weeks or
*  sometimes months after the primary.
*  Unlike any other election in the United States, it is a sequence of elections, not
*  one single election.
*  It starts in January or February, goes all the way to the beginning of June.
*  And because it's sequential, it has a different dynamic.
*  The primary in one state has an impact on the voters in the next state, et cetera,
*  et cetera, all the way until some candidate seems to have a majority of delegates
*  going to the convention.
*  And then if that doesn't happen, there is a convention and the convention is the
*  ultimate authority.
*  That isn't how we did it in, say, 1900.
*  So before we get to how we did it in 1900, why did we move to this sequential
*  primary process?
*  What was the underlying theory of the problems that it solved?
*  It had to do mostly with 1968 and the anti-war movement.
*  In the old days, a lot of delegates went into the convention and they were
*  uncommitted.
*  You didn't know who they were going to vote for at the convention.
*  And by the way, the voters just thought this was natural.
*  They understood this to be a party process, not a public process.
*  And as you may remember from your history books, in 1968, Lyndon Johnson
*  dropped out of the presidential race in March.
*  Even though he won the New Hampshire primary, the Gene McCarthy came pretty
*  close to him in the New Hampshire primary.
*  And he decided to get out of the race and focus on getting out of Vietnam.
*  With America's sons in the field far away, with America's future under
*  challenge right here at home, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or
*  day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the
*  awesome duties of this office, the presidency of your country.
*  Accordingly, I shall not seek and I will not accept the nomination of my party
*  for another term as your president.
*  That meant that there were two sort of kinds of candidates running.
*  There was Hubert Humphrey, who inherited a lot of Lyndon Johnson's
*  political power and delegates.
*  Humphrey, by the way, was the vice president back then.
*  And then there was Gene McCarthy and then eventually Robert F.
*  Kennedy, who ran on an anti-war platform, on a new generation platform, et cetera.
*  And what happened was they couldn't win delegates.
*  And so if you want to get a sense of this, you can go to YouTube history and
*  you'll see that there was sort of a riot outside of the convention in Chicago.
*  Thus, the night that vice president Humphrey was to receive the Democratic
*  party's nomination for president was also the night of the bloodiest confrontation.
*  Hundreds of marchers and dozens of policemen were injured.
*  Restraint was absent on both sides.
*  This was later called a police riot.
*  And there was sort of a riot inside the convention in Chicago.
*  Mr. Chairman, thousands of young people are being beaten.
*  And the streets of Chicago.
*  Wisconsin is not recognized for that purpose.
*  In other words, the 1968 Democratic convention really blew up.
*  And as a result, they established a commission to look at the way the
*  party selected delegates and that changed everything.
*  But I want to get at something a little confusing in there, which is, as you
*  mentioned, there were primaries before 1968.
*  There are primaries in 1968.
*  You just said Johnson won the primary against McCarthy.
*  So what were those primaries doing if they weren't choosing the candidate?
*  Well, first of all, there were very few of them.
*  I think in 68, there were only about 16.
*  And secondly, and most importantly, they were not binding.
*  In other words, a candidate could win the primary and not win
*  any delegates from that state.
*  The process of selecting delegates was not related to the outcome of the primary.
*  Almost all the primaries prior to 1972 were what we used to
*  call beauty contest primaries.
*  In other words, sometimes they were useful in seeing which candidate
*  did well with the voters, but basically they were not determinative of winning delegates.
*  So I want to get at something because I just find this period
*  in our elections fascinating.
*  So delegates make the choice of who the nominee is going to be at the convention.
*  But you also have these primaries that are about giving the
*  delegates functionally information.
*  I think the very famous one is John F.
*  Kennedy in West Virginia.
*  Can you talk a bit about what that primary was and why it then mattered for the
*  convention, even if he didn't win any delegates?
*  Sure.
*  It's a fascinating example of what used to happen in the old days.
*  Kennedy's big problem, as far as the rest of the party was concerned, was that he
*  was a Roman Catholic.
*  And back then, people were not sure that a Roman Catholic could be elected president.
*  You know, there was all this stuff going around about would he answer to the Pope,
*  not the constitution, that sort of thing.
*  So Kennedy needed a place where he could prove to the party elders, like
*  Governor Lawrence of Pennsylvania, who controlled the whole Pennsylvania
*  delegation, Governor Brown of California.
*  He needed to prove that he could win in a Protestant state.
*  He could win Protestant voters.
*  And he won the Wisconsin primary.
*  But when the powers that be looked at the results and looked at the internals, they
*  said, wait a minute, you won this because of an outpouring of support in Catholic
*  precincts. You didn't win Protestants.
*  So that meant he had to look for another primary and he went on to the West
*  Virginia primary.
*  And in West Virginia, there weren't very many Catholics, so it was an all
*  Protestant state.
*  And he won West Virginia.
*  And by winning West Virginia, he seemed to have answered one of the big questions
*  about his candidacy, which is could he win votes in Protestant states?
*  And when that happened, a lot of the people who were watching him, party leaders,
*  elected officials across the country said, maybe this guy can do it and maybe we
*  will support him.
*  And so all this then is getting to this question of the delegates.
*  And in this period in political life, who are the delegates and why do people
*  think it is one, legitimate for them to choose a party nominee, right?
*  Who are they to make that decision?
*  And two, why would they be good at choosing a party nominee?
*  What gives them the expertise to make that decision?
*  In this period of time, and frankly, it's not so different in our own period,
*  delegates are people who have some relationship to their political party.
*  They can be labor union members in the Democratic Party.
*  They can be county chairman.
*  They can be precinct chairman.
*  There are some people who are political actors.
*  They can be the mayor of a small town.
*  They can be a county commissioner.
*  Maybe they worked for the party.
*  Maybe they worked for the party.
*  Maybe they were a super fundraiser for the party, whatever, but they had strong
*  links to the political party.
*  So then 1968 happens.
*  It's a disaster.
*  This commission is appointed.
*  What do they report out?
*  Well, there's two things that really changed fundamentally the way this whole
*  system works.
*  The first was that primaries had to be binding.
*  And so in the old days, a lot of people went to the convention uncommitted.
*  What changed in 72 was the delegates still had to get themselves elected, but
*  they had to be pledged to a presidential candidate.
*  You had to establish a presidential preference and the presidential preference
*  had to have some relationship to the outcome of the primary.
*  The second change that happened was the requirement that in caucus states, the
*  caucuses should be held at the same time throughout the state, because in the old
*  days, like in Iowa, the caucuses would be held over a period of two or three weeks.
*  Well, the problem was the press could not figure out who was winning.
*  I mean, it was almost impossible.
*  To go through, you know, 99 counties in Iowa and thousands of precinct caucuses
*  and figure out who was winning.
*  As soon as you required them to all be at the same day on the same time, well,
*  guess what?
*  They could count and announce it to the press at 11 o'clock.
*  And that was a big story.
*  And what that meant is it essentially turned caucuses into the functional
*  equivalent of a primary.
*  And between those two things, really, we've never looked back.
*  Interestingly enough, Ezra, at the time, no one really understood how big a
*  change this was going to be.
*  Tell me more about why you say that.
*  This is obviously a pretty big change to move from having a convention full of
*  uncommitted delegates who make their decision on the floor of the convention to
*  a convention driven by primaries and caucuses that happened well before.
*  So when you say they didn't understand how big of a change it would be, what
*  did they think they were doing and what did they not predict that then happened?
*  I think they thought they would still control the system.
*  But in fact, once you moved to binding primaries, control moved from the party
*  leaders and the elected officials to voters in primaries.
*  And I don't think anyone anticipated what a profound change that was going to be.
*  They did see it in 1972 when to the consternation of lots of party officials
*  and elected Democrats, the Democrats nominated George McGovern.
*  This is a people's nomination.
*  And next January, we will restore the government to the people of this country.
*  And I believe that American politics will never be quite the same again.
*  And that's when the light bulb went off and people said, Oh no, what have we done?
*  One of the ways I hear this justified now and more than justified, one of the ways I
*  hear things happening at party conventions delegitimized is the idea that primaries
*  are democratic and party leaders or party members making these decisions are
*  non-democratic, right?
*  There was a lot of uproar in 2016 about the potential for superdelegates to act at
*  the convention. That didn't end up being relevant, but people were worried about it.
*  But primaries themselves are not particularly representative.
*  I mean, they're democratic in the sense that if you qualify, if you're part of the
*  party in the right state, you can vote.
*  But relatively few people in those states vote in primaries.
*  Primaries are something that the kind of intense, hardcore, faithful or the otherwise
*  well mobilized do.
*  So how do you think about that question of what is democratic here?
*  The sort of representative function of the local party members acting, the
*  participation function of anyone who wants to can come out to vote.
*  Like, how do you think about the trade-offs from a perspective of
*  representation and democracy?
*  There are two different ways to think about representation and democracy.
*  The primary voter, that's a form of sort of direct democracy, right?
*  You're going to put a bunch of names in front of primary voters and they're going to
*  choose who they like the best.
*  Then there is representative democracy.
*  That's what we have when we elect senators and representatives to Congress, right?
*  We are electing them to make decisions on a wide variety of issues before us.
*  The party leaders and elected officials are almost always elected by someone.
*  In other words, that's one of the things that was missing from the superdelegate
*  debates that we've had in recent years.
*  Congressmen are all elected by many, many more people than sometimes vote in
*  presidential primaries.
*  The senators certainly are elected by a lot more people.
*  The members of the Democratic National Committee are elected people.
*  So this is just a different form of democracy.
*  It's more representative democracy than direct democracy.
*  And that's where the battle is.
*  Some people think that it's only direct democracy that matters.
*  The other thing that gets lost in this debate is that political parties are covered
*  under the First Amendment of the Constitution, under the right of free association.
*  And a lot of court cases over the years have said, in essence, look, a political party
*  can do mostly what they want to do in terms of how they nominate candidates,
*  presidential, congressional, gubernatorial, whatever.
*  They can do that as long as they don't run up against another constitutional right.
*  So the clearest example is the Democratic Party of Texas decided that they were going
*  to have an all-white primary.
*  Black people were not going to be allowed to vote in the primary.
*  Sounds amazing this day and age, but that's what they did.
*  And back in the 1940s, this went all the way to the Supreme Court.
*  And the court said, look, the Democratic primary is tantamount to winning the election.
*  And therefore, if you deprive people of their right to vote in the primary, you are
*  depriving them of their 14th Amendment rights.
*  And of course, that has stood for many, many years.
*  Nobody ever tried that one again.
*  But on other questions like how you allocate delegates to candidates, the courts have
*  basically said, no, that's in the purview of the political parties.
*  One of the other tricky distinctions here to me is that there is this question of who
*  can participate, right?
*  Can you vote in a primary?
*  Then there is this question of what you can vote for in the primary.
*  We have this distinction between primaries, which we see as roughly democratic and
*  conventions, brokered conventions, which we understand is roughly controlled by
*  parties. But that can break down a bit.
*  So to make this clear, look at this year.
*  Go back to September.
*  There's a poll by CNN.
*  Two thirds of Democratic leaning voters do not want Joe Biden to run again.
*  They don't know who they want to run.
*  Nobody in the poll has a large amount of support beyond Joe Biden, but they don't
*  want Biden. They want to find somebody else.
*  But nobody else who is a significant player in the Democratic Party runs.
*  So in a sense, you have a primary happening right now.
*  Joe Biden just completely dominated in South Carolina.
*  But what you have is a brokered primary.
*  There was a lot of party pressure to not have other Democrats jump in.
*  They wanted a united front.
*  They didn't want people weakening Joe Biden.
*  So how do you think about a primary like this year?
*  Because on the one hand, it is a primary.
*  You can vote for it, but there's not really any other choices to vote for if
*  you're a Democrat.
*  So what role is a primary really playing?
*  Well, I think this is less to do with primaries and more to do with
*  incumbency.
*  I mean, if you look back over the last 50 years when we've had primaries, very
*  often the incumbent president doesn't have an opposition in the primary.
*  Bill Clinton didn't have any opposition in 1996.
*  Donald Trump didn't have any opposition in 2020.
*  That's mostly because when you're a sitting president, you have a lot of
*  control over your party.
*  You're doing things for your party.
*  You're raising money for the party.
*  You're making friends.
*  Running against an incumbent president is really hard work.
*  Once the primary is open, however, and there's no incumbent president, we've had
*  no trouble having people get in the primary.
*  There's been lots and lots and lots of people in the primary, as you can recall
*  from some of the recent debate stages, which were so crowded.
*  So I want to talk a bit about what would happen if this year, when the primaries
*  are no longer a viable way for Democrats to pick a candidate, they no longer have
*  an incumbent. Joe Biden steps down.
*  He decides that this isn't right for him any longer.
*  If Biden steps down in April, right, if he says, I've just decided that the right
*  thing for me is to finish out my term and pass leadership on to the next
*  generation of Democrats.
*  What happens?
*  What would begin from there?
*  Well, beginning in April, you're going to see a lot of state conventions, county
*  conventions, et cetera, going through April, May and June.
*  And in those conventions, the party participants and anybody can come to the
*  first of these things.
*  They will pick delegates.
*  They'll pick delegates to the state convention or to a congressional district
*  convention, and they will actually choose the people who go to the national
*  convention in Chicago.
*  So let's suppose that Joe Biden dropped out in April.
*  The people who would want to replace him will engage in a very grassroots campaign
*  to get their loyalists in the state elected to go to the national convention.
*  It will be a little bit like the old fashioned world, just because there weren't
*  primaries doesn't mean that people weren't running around the country trying to get
*  support. Teddy Kennedy was at the state convention in Wyoming speaking for his brother.
*  And Robert Kennedy was all over the country going to state conventions and county
*  conventions and trying to get support for Jack.
*  This was going on way under the surface.
*  And if, in fact, the president was not running, the same thing would happen.
*  People would be out there on behalf of a Gavin Newsom or Governor Whitmer or whoever.
*  People would be out there trying to get people elected to the convention that supported
*  them. It's a very, very grassroots undertaking.
*  We haven't seen it in more than half the century, but that's what would go on.
*  Go a level deeper. When you say they would go to the convention and try to make it such
*  that delegates who liked them were named.
*  So if you're Gavin Newsom, you want Gavin Newsom oriented delegates, because the best
*  way to win a delegate is to have that delegate be for you before they ever walk in the
*  door. What do you do?
*  Who are you trying to convince?
*  How do you know who those delegates are?
*  What kind of politicking is actually happening there?
*  It is the politicking among the activists in the Democratic Party, because those are
*  the people who seek to run as delegates.
*  You would be finding your supporters in the state and encouraging them to go to the
*  county convention or go to the state convention.
*  You would be finding your friends.
*  And again, you need a lot of friends to run for president and you need to have a lot of
*  friends all over the country, which, by the way, is why incumbent presidents do so
*  well and incumbent vice presidents actually do so well, is that they have a chance to
*  make friends all over the place.
*  And in this scenario, you would really need friends all over the country.
*  In Pennsylvania, you need them.
*  You need them in California.
*  You need them all over the place in order to find enough people who would be willing
*  to go engage in this election and get elected as your delegates to the convention.
*  I want to get at the way that would lead to a different selection than primaries, particularly
*  I think in the very modern social media oriented attention era do, which is to say that when
*  one of the main questions is, do you have friends all over the country?
*  Are you able to influence these delegates?
*  It seems to me, looking back on history, to select more for candidates who are broadly
*  acceptable to their party and select against candidates who are maybe insurgent oriented,
*  who are very controversial inside their party.
*  So this is a kind of process.
*  I think it is safe to say that knocks Donald Trump out of contention in a world of delegates
*  and conventions in 2016.
*  Donald Trump does not win the Republican nomination.
*  This is the kind of person who is knocked out by that.
*  But Bernie Sanders probably also does not do nearly as well as he does.
*  And on the other hand, it pushes oftentimes, maybe not always, towards candidates who are
*  well known, you know, you're Hillary Clinton's, you're Joe Biden's, et cetera.
*  Is that a fair way to think about it, that it selects for people who are broadly acceptable
*  to the wide coalition, but against people who might be intensely generating of enthusiasm
*  in smaller factions of the party that are trying to make a run for dominance?
*  Yeah, I think that's a fair way to say it.
*  I don't think it's absolute.
*  I don't think it's as dramatic as some people would have you believe, because in fact, in
*  the many decades since these reforms, both parties have managed to elect a lot of times,
*  very mainstream type candidates, right?
*  Like a Mondale or Mitt Romney or someone like that.
*  But if the old system were to happen today, it also allows for an element of peer review.
*  Now, peer review, if you need brain surgery, right, you go to a brain surgeon who has had
*  other brain surgeons say this person is, yes, capable of doing that.
*  You don't pick your brain surgeon on the basis of his smile or his ability to do well on
*  television. You're looking for sheer competence.
*  That's all. You know, we have peer review in all sorts of areas of American life.
*  Your manicurist has to have a license and has to know enough not to give you an infection
*  in your nails. So, you know, there's peer review all over.
*  The modern primary system is devoid of peer review.
*  There is no place where people who know about government say, hey, this person can or
*  cannot do the job of president of the United States.
*  Had you had some peer review in 2016, Donald Trump probably wouldn't have made it.
*  And take the following fun example.
*  Jack Kennedy in 1960 had to go to Governor Lawrence of Pennsylvania.
*  He was the boss, the big boss of Pennsylvania.
*  He controlled the whole delegation and it was a big one.
*  And he had to go to him and convince him that he would be a good candidate and a good
*  president. So imagine the conversation.
*  Obviously, it's in a smoke-filled room.
*  There's probably some brown liquid, scotch or a bourbon on the table.
*  And the two men are talking.
*  And, you know, obviously, Kennedy does a pretty good job convincing Governor Lawrence.
*  And, you know, they talk about politics, but they also talk about government.
*  Now, imagine Donald Trump having to encounter a Governor Lawrence in order to win the
*  delegates in Pennsylvania.
*  And he goes in, of course, the room's no longer smoke-filled because we don't smoke
*  anymore. But he goes in and he says, you know, I'm going to build a wall on the
*  southern border between us and Mexico.
*  And the governor says, well, OK, I mean, I guess that's a feasible idea and probably
*  pretty popular. And then he says, and I'm going to have Mexico pay for it.
*  Now, that has to be one of the more ridiculous statements a presidential candidate has
*  made. How on earth would you do that?
*  Would you go to war with Mexico to make them pay for a wall?
*  I don't think so. OK.
*  And you can see the another elected official, another person in government saying,
*  huh, how would you do that?
*  Right. In other words, these candidates in this system, there is a measure of
*  competence that takes place.
*  And therefore, a Mary Ann Williamson would never even get in the door.
*  We would still have ideological candidates, but we wouldn't have candidates who
*  were really running to get a slot on CNN or to sell books.
*  We would clear the field of those kinds of candidates.
*  Let me ask if that's not a little bit sunnier of a view of this than sometimes it
*  really was, because, I mean, you know infinitely more about all this than I do.
*  But my sense is that there were sharper boundaries, that it was partially about
*  ideology. The party professionals, the center of the party, the people who held
*  elected office, they were worried about more than competence.
*  They were worried about their power.
*  They were worried about what they would get from this candidate or that candidate.
*  They had their views about what would play well in the electorate.
*  They had their views about, you know, what they wanted to see happen in government.
*  The governor, Lawrence, presumably had substantive commitments that he cared about
*  and wanted whoever the candidate was to actually be doing when they were president.
*  And they also have all kinds of biases about just what a president looks like.
*  Right. I mean, as you were saying, John F.
*  Kennedy had to get through all these traps about whether or not a president could be
*  a Roman Catholic.
*  You know, if you'd had a convention process, Barack Obama was obviously a very, very
*  talented politician and quite well liked within the Democratic Party.
*  But if it had just been a convention, would those same party poobahs have thought that
*  black man with the name Barack Hussein Obama in 2008 could have won?
*  I mean, maybe not. They might have said, you know what?
*  You're great. Hillary Clinton's a safe choice.
*  So I just want to push on that a little bit, because from my read of it, competence was
*  not the only thing these people cared about.
*  There was a lot of trading, of horse trading, of assuming.
*  And that's partially why I think a lot of people now feel it's not that it wasn't
*  legitimate. I mean, the brokering, people don't say that word with a highly positive
*  affect.
*  They were not in the business of taking chances.
*  You're right. They were interested in winning and they were interested in governance and
*  in preserving, of course, their own power.
*  But remember, their own power was not dependent on the presidential candidate.
*  Their own power came from being elected in their states.
*  They knew something about how to win because of the place they were in.
*  And their judgments tended to be pretty good
*  judgments about what it would take to win at least their state.
*  Now, let me ask you about a different timeline here.
*  Let's say it is August 1st.
*  The primaries are over.
*  The delegates are selected, committed, primarily now to Joe Biden.
*  And Joe Biden is a health event or just realizes that he can't do this.
*  It's not for him right now.
*  And he steps down.
*  What happens then?
*  So close to the convention?
*  Well, at that point, you have four thousand and some people who are already elected
*  delegates on their way to Chicago.
*  And I think that other people will throw their hat in the ring and they're going to have
*  to convince those delegates in convention because there's not much time.
*  Right. So you will have what you had in the old days.
*  Delegations will meet in their hotels and the candidates will go from hotel to hotel
*  or their surrogates talking to the delegations and trying to get support.
*  You know, you would have the wives or the husbands being surrogates.
*  You'd have other surrogates going to the smaller state delegations.
*  And meantime, of course, you'd have a wild social media campaign going on.
*  You'd have polling going on.
*  You'd have all the other things going on.
*  It'd be pretty wild.
*  You might need another day for the convention because there'd be so much work to do.
*  And odds are you'd have to go beyond one ballot for somebody to get the nomination.
*  Odds are you'd need a first ballot just to figure out where everybody was.
*  And then you'd probably take a break before you had your second ballot.
*  It would be pretty wild.
*  OK, it would be pretty wild.
*  I think for political reporters, Ezra, it would be the most fun of your whole life.
*  And you'd love it.
*  I think the voters would be absolutely tuned into their televisions.
*  This would be great reality TV, if you will.
*  It would be reality politics.
*  But there are rules and processes for getting through this.
*  And I think at the end of the day, you would have a Democratic nominee.
*  Now, who knows how that would play in a general election, especially if only one
*  party was going through this.
*  Who knows what that would do to the general election.
*  But it would be an old fashioned convention.
*  Well, let me try to live in this world for a minute, right?
*  Try to imagine how it would feel and what would happen.
*  Let's think August, maybe July, right?
*  There are a couple of months here.
*  Here's what I see happening.
*  There is a mad dash.
*  I mean, Joe Biden gives a speech, gives a sort of heroic, honorable speech.
*  I've decided that it's the right thing for me is to be a bridge to the next generation.
*  That we all need to know when our time is up, that I have important work that I still
*  need to focus on in trying to defend Ukraine and Israel, Palestine and all these
*  different things.
*  And so there's a sort of applause to Joe Biden.
*  And then all of a sudden there is this mad dash.
*  You have, of course, Vice President Harris, but it's very easy to name eight or 10
*  other people who would be very plausible here.
*  Buttigieg, Raimondo, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, Jared Polis, Raphael Warnock.
*  Anybody can have their list.
*  Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar.
*  CNN and MSNBC are going to start running candidate forums, like on the daily.
*  And you know, as many of these can actually be done because one, they can
*  actually shift the world, right?
*  I mean, you really like if the right 5,000 people watch this, you might just win the
*  convention and the nomination and become the next president.
*  They're going to be giving speeches.
*  They're going to be sitting for a million interviews and podcasts, very busy time
*  on the Ezra Klein show.
*  So there's going to be a month or two month period here where they're doing the
*  thing that you talked about with the beauty contest primaries earlier.
*  They are trying in every forum they can think of to show that they have that it
*  factor, right?
*  That they are electric, that they will win, that they know how to hold the tensions
*  of this moment and inspire, but also maybe convince voters who would be
*  wavering from the Democrats.
*  You would have a run-up period, depending on how long it is, that would not really
*  be primary oriented, but would be mass media oriented because you're trying to
*  shift polling, shift narratives, be on social media in a way that the delegates
*  who are coming walk into that convention thinking, you know, it's pretty clear to
*  me that Gretchen Whitmer is the one who could win this election.
*  Or it's pretty clear to me that Ro Khanna is a person setting people aflame.
*  And so in a kind of often dead period, you have what would be a genuinely riveting
*  democratic spectacle.
*  I think the thing people worry about and quite reasonably is that the party
*  fractures here, that the fighting immediately becomes riven with ill will,
*  that it becomes toxic, that, you know, should this be given to Vice President
*  Harris?
*  And if it's not given to Vice President Harris, does that mean the party is
*  passing over a black woman?
*  You know, what does that mean about the party?
*  But that it could also just be a contest.
*  I mean, how do you imagine that playing out?
*  Oh, Ezra, I think that's hard to say.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that really is.
*  How do you mean it's feeling?
*  I don't mean how do you mean it ending, but how do you imagine people acting
*  within this period?
*  My guess is it would not turn toxic.
*  I'll tell you why.
*  It's too short of a period of time.
*  The first thing candidates do is they try to introduce themselves in a favorable
*  light to the voters.
*  In this case, the voters are basically 4,000 people who are packing their bags
*  to go to Chicago.
*  And it would be sort of a bad idea to get really toxic at that point, because if
*  your first introduction to these people is you're out there saying ugly things
*  about Kamala Harris, or you're out there saying ugly things about Gavin Newsom,
*  it's probably not a smart thing to do.
*  And I don't think the divisions within the Democratic Party are as ugly as the
*  divisions within the Republican Party.
*  If Trump was your example here, I think this could get really ugly if the
*  Republicans were confronting the same thing.
*  But the Democratic divisions are simply not that deep.
*  And you just don't have time.
*  You just don't have time.
*  And you'd always be worried about how is this impacting these 4,000 people?
*  There would be a lot of attention to who these people are and a lot of seeking the
*  biographies of these people of every single vote.
*  And there would be an advantage to being from a big state, which is sort of not
*  important anymore, but used to be.
*  So Gavin Newsom would go in with by far the biggest block of delegates to the
*  Democratic convention, Texas, New York, Illinois, they would all have big blocks
*  of delegates.
*  And if you came from one of those states, you would have an advantage, no doubt
*  about it, going into the convention.
*  You mentioned a minute ago that you've got these 4,000 plus delegates coming.
*  And that implies that there are 4,000 plus individual decision-makers.
*  There are also super delegates, senators and members of Congress from the party.
*  But is it that many individual people?
*  When people talk about the brokered convention, when you talked about John of
*  Kennedy meeting with governors, I think there's a sense, at least from the past,
*  that maybe not everybody votes as a block, but there are decision-makers who sway
*  their groups and who have a lot of power.
*  Who has power in this?
*  Is this a world where Ben Wickler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party,
*  and LeVora Barnes, the chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, do they become
*  super powerful?
*  Are they the brokers?
*  If you are a candidate, who are you really trying to meet with and move here?
*  Well, it's going to differ from state to state because, first of all, if you have
*  a governor in the state, so in Michigan, it would not be the party chair, it would
*  be Gretchen Whitmer herself.
*  So one of the things I can tell you that most people don't realize is I've been a
*  delegate to 10 Democratic conventions and I've sat in the delegation.
*  And you'd be amazed how little of the conversation has to do with the
*  presidential candidate.
*  As Tip O'Neill said, all politics is local.
*  So for all the years I sat in the Massachusetts delegation, I don't think I
*  ever had a conversation about the presidential candidates.
*  It was all about who's going to be the next speaker of the House?
*  How many seats do we think we can pick up in the legislature?
*  Who's going to run for attorney general?
*  It was all local politics.
*  Now, given that it's so local politics, people who are powerful in the state are
*  going to be the ones that can most easily sway the delegates.
*  So a sitting governor is going to be very important.
*  If you don't have a sitting governor, but you've got, say, one United States
*  senator, that person's going to be very important.
*  The other thing you have at a Democratic convention is you have a lot of
*  members of labor unions.
*  So the labor union members will probably meet and caucus aside from
*  whatever state they're in.
*  So if you're a UAW member and you get to the convention as a delegate, you're
*  going to pay a lot of attention to what the UAW president says and to what the
*  president of the AFL-CIO says.
*  You'll have different blocks according to where people's interests lie.
*  So it'll be a combination of interest groups and political power within each state.
*  I think within this speculative scenario we're playing with here, you can imagine
*  two different branches.
*  One, Joe Biden steps aside, but says, Vice President Harris has been my partner in
*  every major decision.
*  She is a person to lead the Democratic party.
*  All of you delegates who have been named to vote for me, I really hope you'll vote
*  for her.
*  And another is where he doesn't do that, says she's great, but says it's a grand
*  party and that he trusts the delegates in the party or just doesn't really say
*  anything about it at all.
*  We typically think about something like this passing on to the vice president
*  pretty easily.
*  Harris, I think, occupies an unusual space in the party.
*  She has some really significant backers and fans, and also there is concern.
*  She pulls a little bit behind Joe Biden.
*  How would this work when you have somebody who in many ways would be the obvious next
*  candidate, but also there is concern and worry about them as the next nominee?
*  I think it would depend on who else decides to get into the race.
*  You can imagine that if Joe Biden got out and said, I'd like to endorse Kamala Harris.
*  She's been great.
*  She can do the job of president.
*  I'm vouching for that.
*  You can imagine that that would have a stifling effect on other people.
*  A lot of people would decide, no, I'm not going to run against her.
*  I'm not going to get into the race.
*  And so that would probably help clear the field.
*  The question is, after a Biden announcement, would somebody else jump into the race?
*  And if not, then I think people would pretty much stand behind Harris and nominate
*  her as president.
*  But if you had a couple other powerful figures get into the race, then I think you
*  might have an open battle for the nomination.
*  I don't think that Dean Phillips would be the logical choice, but somebody like if
*  Gavin Newsom decided to get in, well, you're instantly splitting the California delegation.
*  So it really depends on whether someone gets in or not.
*  I think something that sits in people's heads here is, as you mentioned, the last
*  example of this on the Democratic side is 1968, which is one of the worst party
*  conventions in history.
*  I think it is fair to say.
*  Right.
*  It's fair to say.
*  But there have been other conventions that are very fractious in the convention that
*  nominated Woodrow Wilson in 1912.
*  It took, I think, 46 ballots for Wilson supporters to break the deadlock there.
*  Sometimes the party just really cannot agree.
*  I've been reading this book about the convention that picked Lincoln and over on
*  the Democrat side, the first convention fails and they have to go and have a second
*  meeting later on.
*  What tends to divide the conventions that go well for parties from the
*  conventions that go poorly?
*  What tends to divide them is ideology or deep regional differences, which then have
*  ideological implications.
*  So it's ideology that really makes the big explosive conventions over civil rights,
*  for the Democrats fought over that for many of their conventions.
*  There have been other issues.
*  Lincoln's party, I'm sure you know more than I do at this point, but it's
*  fascinating.
*  That was a brand new party.
*  And of course it had a pretty explosive issue and it was called slavery and
*  whether or not there would be a civil war.
*  So you can see why when the stakes are huge, the conventions can be quite
*  contentious.
*  I don't see that on the Democratic side this time.
*  The Democratic party today has been quite unified.
*  For the entire speakership of Nancy Pelosi, the margins in the House were not
*  very big and they managed to pass an awful lot of legislation.
*  I could see it more likely on the Republican side if it were Trump who were
*  dropping out or he had a health issue.
*  And we have to keep reminding ourselves that he is 77 and he can have health
*  issues too.
*  I think if it were on the Republican side, you'd have a great big civil war
*  as we're seeing in the House of Representatives right now between MAGA and
*  more mainstream Republicans.
*  But I don't see that at least at this point in history on the Democratic side.
*  I was trying to think about this myself and the issue that I could see becoming
*  extremely disruptive, even up to schism on the Democratic side, if it continues to
*  get worse, and there was quite a bit of time between now and then, is Israel and
*  Palestine.
*  I mean, that is a place where I think you'd see huge protest movements, a
*  gigantic divide between younger Democrats and older Democrats.
*  But I also think you're seeing the Democratic party try to shift its position
*  on this even right now.
*  So possibly by the time you got to a convention that there would be a little
*  bit more party unity on it.
*  On the other side, there is this intense unifying pressure of Donald Trump.
*  The fundamental issue of the Democratic party is that Donald Trump should not be
*  president again.
*  And the fact that he would be being nominated, I think would create a
*  strategic sharpening of the mind on the Democratic side, much as it did in 2020,
*  which led to the nomination of Joe Biden.
*  So it's funny because I could see it going a bit both ways, but this seems to me
*  to be a Democratic party more so than in some other times that is very obsessed
*  with winning because it really fears the consequences of losing.
*  And so it reminds me a bit of something that I love from that Lincoln book, Edward
*  Acorn's book, The Lincoln Miracle.
*  And he quotes Charles Sumner, who is a senator at that point, sending a welcome
*  message to the delegates whose duty it is to organize victory, which I just think
*  is such a great quote about what parties are meant to do.
*  They organize victory.
*  But tell me a bit about what happens when you have a convention with multiple
*  strong candidates.
*  I mean, the 1960 convention is interesting from this perspective because
*  JFK is a strong candidate.
*  LBJ is a strong candidate.
*  What happens there?
*  The 60 convention is a really very interesting convention because there were
*  really serious candidates in that race.
*  They were highly respected and they had a lot of support.
*  Each one of them had support within the hall.
*  But what the delegates at that convention saw, particularly the ones who were
*  uncommitted, was they got to see up close and personal a very charismatic candidate.
*  And compared to Lyndon Johnson, compared to Senator Symington or any of the other
*  people there, Kennedy was just really a new generation and so handsome and so
*  charismatic that delegates said, yep, he's our guy, even with Kennedy's attributes.
*  He almost lost the 60 convention.
*  He almost lost it.
*  But that, I think, made him stand out from the pack.
*  It was a generational turn which everybody got behind.
*  Suddenly the World War II generation was coming into its own in terms
*  of leadership of the country.
*  So I think that's what happened in 1960.
*  Again, you can see on YouTube history, you can see a meeting in Los Angeles at
*  the 1960 convention where Jack Kennedy addresses them and Lyndon Johnson addresses
*  them and Lyndon Johnson stands up and he kind of drones on and on about all the
*  major pieces of legislation he has passed as majority leader in the Senate.
*  Six days and nights, I had to deliver a quorum of 51 men on a moment's notice to
*  keep the Senate in session to get any bill at all.
*  And I'm proud to tell you that on those 50 quorum calls, Lyndon Johnson answered
*  every one of them.
*  That's his presentation.
*  Kennedy gets up there and he smiles.
*  He starts joking.
*  He's holding the audience in the palm of his hand.
*  So I come to you today full of admiration for Senator Johnson, full of affection for
*  him, strongly in support of him for majority leader.
*  And I'm confident that in that position, we're all going to be able to work together.
*  Thank you.
*  And you can see right there, right in that one little clip, why Kennedy managed to get
*  the nomination away from Johnson.
*  Even so, however, there was so much Johnson support in that convention that Kennedy had
*  to put Johnson on the ticket as vice presidential candidate.
*  And they didn't really get along very well.
*  Kennedy's brother, Bobby, hated LBJ and vice versa.
*  Nonetheless, LBJ was on the ticket because he had delegate strength.
*  One danger of possibly going to a convention for Democrats is that they just don't know
*  how to do it anymore.
*  The candidates don't know how to politic among delegates.
*  They've not had to do that in a very long time.
*  They don't really think about delegate math.
*  They have no muscle memory of this.
*  The delegates don't know how to pick a candidate.
*  They've not had to do that.
*  They did not get named to this thinking that the weight of the entire country and its future
*  would be on their shoulders.
*  That there's a possibility just for procedural chaos, for this to not go well because the
*  relevant people no longer know how to do this kind of thing.
*  Do you worry about that?
*  No, I don't.
*  And the reason is that the people who become delegates in 2024 are not really dramatically
*  different than the people who became delegates in 1960.
*  They are people who are experienced in politics.
*  There are obviously more women, more people of color.
*  That's the difference.
*  But those women are Poles.
*  The people of color are Poles.
*  They have come up in a system.
*  They've won a delegate slot, which means they have some support within their political party
*  back home. You'll have a bunch of senators there.
*  You'll have a bunch of congressmen there.
*  They do this every day, right?
*  Every day they've got votes.
*  They have to see how many they have to count votes.
*  They have to figure out who they can get to their side.
*  They have to, you know, they have to.
*  That's what they're doing there on the floor of the House of Representatives, which, you
*  know, looks pretty confusing to us.
*  And so I have pretty much faith that the delegates would figure this out and that the party
*  leaders would figure it out.
*  The presidential candidates, the problem there would be, I think, that they themselves would
*  not have a broad enough understanding of 50 state politics to operate very effectively.
*  So you can see there being some confusion there.
*  But, you know, democracy is a mess.
*  You know, as Winston Churchill said, democracy is the worst form of government except for
*  all the others.
*  One of the things you told me once that has stuck in my head is that all the machinery
*  is still there. We actually still run a convention process.
*  We just don't run it openly.
*  We just don't use any of those systems or that many of those systems for their intended
*  purpose. The thing that may not be there is a sense that parties and party
*  actors are legitimate.
*  I think about this in the 2016 Republican convention, where even though a lot of the
*  official Republican Party really loathed Donald Trump, it didn't feel like it had the
*  strength to try to stop him.
*  I think about this with the sort of backlash on the superdelegates on the Democratic side.
*  And I think one of the fears or the ways this could go quite bad is that Democrats end up
*  at a convention process and there is anger.
*  Like, we the people did not get to vote.
*  You just did this.
*  The party just did this and parties are not supposed to do this.
*  The fact that they did it in the past doesn't mean it fits the mores and expectations of
*  the present.
*  How do you think about this question of legitimacy?
*  Well, that's an interesting question.
*  I think what would happen is if the primaries were over or we were in the middle of the
*  primaries, people would understand that, okay, you can't rerun 50 state elections because
*  after all, November is election day and you've got to have a nominee by then.
*  I think people would understand that the political parties would have to do it and that the
*  people who are participating in the political parties, in fact, are duly elected.
*  This was one of the most misleading things about the superdelegate debate was that they
*  kept calling them elites as if they were a bunch of billionaires.
*  No, they were senators and congressmen and mayors and governors who had been elected.
*  By people and therefore you had a sort of representative form of government.
*  I think that in an extraordinary circumstance, the people would understand that it's now
*  gone to the parties.
*  And in fact, the compromise that was ultimately reached between the Bernie Sanders people
*  and the Democratic Party was that the superdelegates would only vote on the second ballot.
*  The thinking behind the second ballot was that if superdelegates had a role on the first
*  ballot, their count in the delegate count could distort what the people were saying
*  in the primaries.
*  In other words, you could have the superdelegates going for a person who was not winning the
*  primaries.
*  On the other hand, if in fact no one won the primaries definitively, no one had a clean
*  majority going into the convention, then in fact the people would not have spoken clearly.
*  They would have spoken and they would have spoken in different directions.
*  And at that point, it made sense to have the party leadership involved in the selection
*  of a nominee.
*  So in that compromise, I think you see that people would probably understand, okay, look,
*  we can't rerun 50 primaries.
*  It's over.
*  Our candidate is not able to serve or not willing to serve.
*  Okay, we've got to go to plan B. And plan B is you have the convention decide.
*  What do you think it would feel like?
*  I know it's a sort of soft question.
*  We've been talking a lot about rules and delegate selection processes, but if we end
*  up in the scenario where over the summer, the Democratic Party suddenly enters into
*  an almost unknown situation in the modern era where its incumbent president is not running.
*  It is looking towards making a decision at the convention.
*  There's all of a sudden a huge amount of politicking of a kind people haven't really
*  seen before.
*  What do you think that feels like in this period, in this era of the media, in this
*  moment in American politics?
*  What has it felt like in the past?
*  What would it, how would that be different now?
*  Well, I think what would be different now is the intense coverage of the politicking.
*  In the past, this politicking went on largely unseen and they certainly weren't covered
*  in the way we think of covering a political event today.
*  So in the past, this all went on behind the scenes, really.
*  I think that if we had to do this all over again, it would be covered extensively.
*  There would be national television crews at the Wyoming State Convention or the Illinois
*  State Convention.
*  It would look to the voters as pretty chaotic initially, just as when the voters, if they
*  ever tune into a debate on the floor of the House of Representatives, right?
*  It's all these people milling around and people taking turns arguing against each other,
*  et cetera.
*  But I also think it would be fascinating.
*  And I think the voters would like it, frankly.
*  I think it would be reality TV and people would get into it.
*  And I think they'd like it.
*  And they might learn something about the democratic process.
*  There'd be something ironic about Donald Trump losing to a better reality television
*  show than he was able to put on.
*  But to that point, would a ticket coming out of a convention in late August have time
*  and capability to mount an effective general election campaign?
*  It's Joe Biden who's been doing the fundraising, right?
*  I mean, the DNC does some fundraising, but this ticket would not have been doing its
*  own fundraising for months and months and frankly, well over a year now.
*  How could they actually run?
*  Well, remember that when you come out of the convention, this becomes a party matter
*  anyway.
*  So it would depend not on whether the candidate could raise money, but is the party in good
*  shape financially?
*  It's the national political parties and the state parties' health in terms of finances
*  that are really important when you come out of the convention and you go into the general
*  election because they can then raise money for the whole ticket.
*  So in 2016, Donald Trump had a mess of an organization nationally.
*  Didn't matter because the Republican Party at that point was very strong.
*  The state parties were very strong.
*  They had talented leadership.
*  They had a lot of money.
*  This year, by the way, the Republican parties are sort of in a mess.
*  As you've probably read, they're replacing the Republican National Committee chairwoman.
*  They're replacing her.
*  There's four Republican parties in swing states that are basically out of money.
*  Possibly replacing her with a Trump.
*  Yeah, right.
*  With a Trump.
*  Yeah.
*  And so this kind of party chaos in the election year doesn't bode well for the strength of
*  the party in the general election.
*  Democrats have more money than the Republicans do right now.
*  They have more cash on hand.
*  They have a stable leadership, et cetera.
*  And you don't have the chaos in Democratic parties that you do in Republican parties.
*  But it's still the candidates who are better fundraisers.
*  I mean, the DNC is raising money, but Biden raised a lot more money.
*  He's got more than $100 million on hand.
*  Can they use that money?
*  Can that money be transferred around?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, at the point when you come out of the convention, it really does become a party
*  operation.
*  It's no longer an individual candidate operation.
*  Presumably, Kamala Harris, if she was the nominee, or Gretchen Whitmer, would presumably,
*  they would go do massive DNC fundraisers and raise as much as they could.
*  Once you're out of the convention, it's all one big happy family.
*  Not always really happy, but boy, they pretend to the world that they are.
*  And there's great unity when you come out of a convention.
*  And there's also enormous legal flexibility for the money to state parties, to the national
*  party, to the candidate campaigns, et cetera.
*  But it's the party.
*  It's the health of the party at that point.
*  I think that's a good place to end.
*  So always our final question.
*  What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  Well, I'd start with All the King's Men.
*  This is an old one by Robert Penn Warren.
*  And there's lots in it about party conventions and all the deal making that goes on.
*  I go to next, The Making of the President, 1960 by Theodore White, which is about that
*  election.
*  And there's lots of background stuff on how John Kennedy won the Democratic nomination
*  and how Richard Nixon won the Republican nomination.
*  And I'd end with Quiet Revolution by Byron Schaeffer, which is the inside story of the
*  McGovern-Fraser Commission.
*  And we talked in the podcast about how people didn't really understand what was happening
*  when they made all these rule changes.
*  And this book tells that story really well.
*  So I think if you're really interested in conventions and the nomination process and
*  a little history, those three would give you a very good background.
