# Why This Economist Wants to Give Every Poor Child $50,000
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tSGiQXWx3s)
*  One of my longtime obsessions as a policy reporter is the question of wealth.
*  Most of American politics, most of American economic policy, I would say, is about the question of income.
*  What wages look like, whether they're rising or falling, for whom.
*  When we talk about inequality, we're typically talking about income.
*  But wealth is as important, I think maybe more important.
*  We don't measure it as well, but it says more about what a family, what a person can actually do under duress.
*  It says more about how they can invest in their future.
*  It says more, knowing their wealth can often tell you a lot more than their income can, about the long term prospects of that family.
*  And wealth has this other quality, again, different than income, which is that it is where the past compounds into the present.
*  Where injustices of the past compound into the present, where the benefits of the past, privileges of the past compound into the present.
*  Wealth is where the long story of a family or a country makes the reality of the moment.
*  And for that reason, it's uncomfortable.
*  Wealth is uncomfortable because what does it mean to inherit?
*  What does it mean to ask people to pay up for the sins of those who came before them?
*  But on the other hand, much more so than income, if you don't do anything about wealth, it just compounds and the inequalities of a society go greater and become more present every single day.
*  So for all those reasons, I've long been interested in policies that would do something about the wealth gaps we have.
*  Often what we do is we make policy to make wealth inequality worse.
*  In the time I've covered politics, we've made the estate tax a lot looser.
*  We've made the thresholds beneath which it doesn't apply much higher.
*  You can pass down millions of dollars before you get taxed now.
*  We also have just a ton of tax policy meant to help people build wealth, which is great.
*  We help people buy homes and we help people go to college and we help people do all these good things.
*  The problem is you can only get that policy if you have some wealth to put into these advantaged accounts in the first place.
*  What we don't have a lot of is policy that helps people who don't have wealth build it.
*  And so I've been very intrigued by this idea that the economist, Derek Hamilton, and others have put forward called baby bonds,
*  which would be this proposal to simply give people wealth, everybody.
*  Now, not everybody would get the same amount.
*  You get a lot more if you were poorer than if you were rich, if you did not have wealth as a family than if you did,
*  you would not be able to use it for anything.
*  It's circumscribed. It's a wealth building policy, not just a policy to help people spend.
*  But more so than anything else out there, it has this potential to all in one swoop,
*  really shift the wealth distribution of the country,
*  and really make sure that everybody has a chance to enjoy the benefits of wealth,
*  as opposed to that being something that is reserved for those who got it from generations before them,
*  but that those who did not have that luck simply are left without.
*  Derek Hamilton is a professor of economics and urban policy at the New School.
*  He served on the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force and was an advisor to Bernie Sanders.
*  His ideas have been picked up into lots of pieces of federal legislation,
*  and Baby Bonds in particular has been introduced by Cory Booker and Ayanna Pressley in Congress,
*  not in its exact form of his, but in a pretty close one.
*  So this is a policy actively under consideration.
*  It is something you can imagine passing at some point in the future,
*  if it were something Democrats prioritized,
*  if it were something that they wanted to make the thing they did if they got power again.
*  So should they? That's what I wanted to talk to Hamilton about.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Derek Hamilton, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you, Ezra. Pleasure to be on with you.
*  We talk a lot in American politics about income, about wages.
*  But something you write that sticks in my head is that, quote,
*  wealth is the paramount indicator of economic prosperity and well-being. Why?
*  I mean, think about what you can do with wealth that you can't do with income.
*  If you have a child that's about to enter college,
*  chances are your income is not going to be able to afford you the choice
*  to send that child to any school that they could actually get into.
*  Some schools just simply might be too expensive.
*  If you're faced with a legal challenge and you want to hire a high-priced attorney,
*  the cost will be such that you will have to use some wealth
*  and income probably couldn't afford you that attorney.
*  I mean, we can think of other things as well.
*  So even aside from economic security, if you want to do things with your life,
*  suppose I realize that my passion isn't to be a professor,
*  but I really have this innovative idea and I want to bring it to market.
*  Well, if I have capital, I'm better positioned to bring that idea to market.
*  If I want to move and purchase a house somewhere, you know,
*  basically the point is that wealth affords you economic agency
*  in ways that income does not.
*  Income is largely used to pay your expenses that happen on a periodic basis,
*  whereas wealth gives you the ability to withstand shocks
*  and the ability to make investments.
*  Ultimately, wealth gives you choice in ways that income does not.
*  There's a line I've seen you use that that brought to mind
*  where you and co-authors talk about wealth as being a way
*  to fully participate in the market.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  You know, think about income.
*  If you are a worker, you can't just simply decide
*  that you want to leave your job and do something else.
*  But if you have wealth, if you have a stock of assets,
*  it gives you the freedom, the choice to really negotiate
*  with whatever it is you bring to market, be it your labor or your innovation
*  or some ideas.
*  So wealth with that stock, that provides you really agency to make choices.
*  So I think people, particularly who listen to this podcast,
*  are somewhat familiar with looking at the American economy
*  through the lens of income and inequality.
*  What changes either in the data or in the distribution
*  when you begin to look at it through the lens of wealth inequality?
*  Wealth is so concentrated in the United States.
*  You know, very few people own a great deal of the wealth.
*  And of course, if we look at race, that becomes even more dramatic.
*  So if we compare inequality in the domains of income versus wealth,
*  essentially, there is no comparison.
*  We can cite statistics, but the gist of it is very few people
*  own most of the nation's wealth.
*  Well, let me cite some.
*  You cite numbers from 2019 that suggest the top 10 percent of households
*  own about 70 percent of all wealth, 70 percent.
*  And so that's twice the net worth of the bottom 90 percent of households combined.
*  This is one of those places where I think if you marinate in it for long enough,
*  you begin to really feel the unfairness in the economy.
*  For income, if you want more of it, you have to go out and work for it.
*  You have to go lift a box or have a new idea or write marketing copy or something.
*  But wealth isn't like that.
*  What you got to do to get more money from wealth is just let your money go out there
*  and make money on its own.
*  So the number here that I think is really striking is real household income.
*  The money people work to get it grew by about 30 percent between 1989 and 2018.
*  The S&P 500 grew by about 400 percent.
*  So if you're working a job and getting raises, you can make more money, right?
*  Over decades.
*  But if you just had enough money that it could sit there in the S&P 500,
*  it went up by multiples and you didn't really have to do anything new to get that at all.
*  So this gets to something that's become very famous in policy circles in the last
*  couple of years, which is Thomas Piketty's famous R is bigger than G equation.
*  So I was hoping for folks who aren't familiar with it, you could walk through it.
*  R over G. All right.
*  So you sound excited already.
*  The rate of return to capital has grown and continues to grow at a much faster rate
*  than overall growth.
*  And that is how society has been structured.
*  And if you don't have interventions from an entity like the government sector to
*  allow for some redistribution, oftentimes due to tax code, then you end up in a
*  perpetual cycle where those that have the benefit of capital continue to grow their
*  capital. And then here's the other point.
*  That growth rate in capital certainly can transform political situations to benefit
*  capital in the first place.
*  So in other words, it's not just economic growth that becomes compounded.
*  The power associated with that increased wealth translate into ability to influence the
*  political structure and system so as to have a feedback to grow your wealth even more.
*  Yeah, I was going to get into this later, but maybe we should get into it now, which
*  is that I think it can be easy to hear this conversation about wealth and markets and
*  think of this as an automatic process of capitalism.
*  But even putting aside the way we structure markets, there is a huge amount of tax policy.
*  I think the estimate I saw in one of your papers was over seven hundred billion dollars
*  a year that is designed to wealth build.
*  And on the one hand, that policy is facially neutral.
*  So therefore, in theory, anybody, but you need to have wealth to use it.
*  So do you want to talk a bit about what the tax code is doing here and the way we are
*  manipulating, increasing and advantaging wealth in the tax code?
*  Yeah, the extent to which our tax code incentivizes wealth and capital growth, it centers on existing
*  wealth and capital growth.
*  Now it need not be that way.
*  We could use the tax code in a way to promote new wealth.
*  There's the famous study called Upside Down that came out of Prosperity Now that shows
*  that we spend about in excess of seven hundred billion dollars in promoting asset development
*  in the United States.
*  And what are things associated with asset development?
*  The different ways in which we tax capital gains versus wages, the different ways in
*  which we treat homeowners versus renters.
*  So you're able to deduct the interest payments on your mortgage from your taxes, whereas
*  a renter doesn't have that access.
*  So we may even think as a society, that's a good thing.
*  Wealth is good for society.
*  But the problem is to whom that tax code benefits.
*  So the more accurate estimate of seven hundred plus billion dollars, about a third of that
*  will go to people earning over a million dollars.
*  The bottom 60 percent of earners will receive about five percent of that distribution.
*  So one could reimagine a tax code that spends similar amounts of money, but does it in a
*  more distributionally fair way.
*  Because as we've been talking, a lot of that is associated with having existing capital
*  in the first place.
*  So the government is strategically directing public resources in a way to promote even
*  greater growth of those that have wealth to begin with.
*  And I want to get at one of the dynamics in this, because a lot of this is very well-meaning.
*  So there's a great statistic in one of your papers about how fewer than three percent
*  of Americans have what are called 529s or Covrdel accounts, which are these tax advantaged
*  accounts to save for education.
*  And it's great, right?
*  You know, helping people put money away for kids college in a tax free way, helping them
*  build for the future.
*  You don't have to be running any kind of scheme to make America unequal to think that would
*  be great.
*  But most people don't have them because most people can't save that much money in them.
*  And so I think we're used to thinking about tax policy as being unequal when it's sort
*  of designed unequally.
*  But you can have a policy or accounts that are totally neutral.
*  Anybody can take advantage of them.
*  But if you don't have money to put into them, you can't.
*  And so in effect, they become a way that people are pretty wealthy, can keep a lot of money
*  tax free that if you are not that wealthy, you don't have access to anything like that.
*  Yeah, I mean, fundamentally, wealth begets more wealth.
*  And if we have a society that uses the tax code, the privilege existing wealth, that
*  only enhances that framework, that equation.
*  But again, if we could reimagine the tax code, there's nothing wrong with promoting wealth
*  for the American people.
*  The problem is how we do it and to whom it's distributed.
*  So if we set up structures, incentives and straight up grants that allow people to get
*  into an asset that can passively appreciate in a more egalitarian way, that would be better.
*  That same amount of money could be used to facilitate a down payment for somebody to
*  get into home ownership who otherwise wouldn't get into home ownership.
*  And it's still growing the nation's saving and wealth, but doing it in what I would say
*  a more fair, just and even productive manner.
*  I'm going to put a pin in that because I want to get to that policy.
*  But I want to go through a couple more pieces of the the wealth context first.
*  And one thing here that I want to be careful about, we keep talking about wealth as if
*  it's one thing.
*  And the examples of you so far things like stocks and homes.
*  But the composition of wealth, I mean, what we measure as wealth includes a lot of things
*  and the composition of what wealth people have changes as you go up and down the class
*  ladder.
*  So could you talk a bit about the different types of wealth and how the wealth that people
*  in the working class have if they have it tends to be pretty different than people in
*  the richer segments of society?
*  That's right.
*  I mean, if we get into issues of diversified portfolios, we know that it's better to not
*  have all your eggs in one basket.
*  But one needs to realize that if you have a little egg to begin with, it's hard to spread
*  it amongst many baskets.
*  So in the American case, the asset that most people start out with, and again, it's for
*  those individuals that are able to get into substantive ways to generate wealth and assets.
*  It's often a home.
*  As such, the composition of their wealth is often primarily in a home in a large percentage
*  way.
*  But as you grow your wealth, you're able to use that additional wealth to diversify your
*  financial portfolio.
*  Then you start to get into things like stock ownership and potentially even business ownership.
*  And that gets us something I think important here, which is, you know, at the beginning,
*  you gave the example of wanting to start a business or sending a kid to an expensive
*  school or maybe needing to get a lawyer.
*  If you've got a bunch of stocks sitting around and your wealth is in stocks and you need
*  to sell some of them to do that, you know, so be it.
*  If your wealth is in your home, it's not that that isn't real, you can sell your home.
*  There's a lot that comes along with selling your home, from having to move to another
*  home to maybe being a very emotionally important part of your life and the place where your
*  kids grew up.
*  I mean, there is a difference, I think, between having your wealth tied up in the place you
*  live and having it, you know, invested in a hedge fund.
*  If we look at financial wealth as the sole category, these disparities that we started
*  out describing in the beginning, they grow even wider, which is your point.
*  We also think about the benefits of a home.
*  You really need a residence, you know, someplace to actually live and also the attachment that
*  comes along with social ties.
*  But we offer various other amenities with your home as well, such as a school.
*  The quality of your school is attached to the neighborhood that you live in.
*  Those that can afford affluent neighborhoods and a home to match often are in better school
*  districts so that their kids even end up with a better hand when they become an adult
*  and begin the process of wealth building.
*  We've talked here a bit about wealth and equality and wealth composition.
*  Tell me about the black-white wealth gap.
*  Now that's dramatic.
*  The black-white wealth gap is such that the typical black household throughout American
*  history has rarely had more than a dime for every dollar as the typical white household.
*  Not just wealth as an outcome, but its functional role, what it can do for you.
*  So we end up in locked-in inequality.
*  And what makes it more pernicious is that locked-in inequality is often defined by the
*  race that you're born into.
*  And so this is probably a point to ask, are we talking here about means or medians?
*  And how are those two measures different?
*  And was looking at one of them get you that looking at the other one misses and vice versa?
*  If we were to look at mean, the differences we're citing are even more dramatic.
*  If we were to look at the mean wealth difference, black people as a group own about 3% of the
*  nation's wealth.
*  Black people make up well over 12% of the nation's population, but own about 3% of the
*  wealth.
*  I think a fair number is to use the median if we're thinking about differences across
*  race because then you want to look at what's typical about a black experience versus a
*  white experience.
*  But if we look at the mean, the mean is more dramatic because America has a wealth inequality
*  period.
*  So we have a problem with a concentration of wealth regardless of race, but it becomes
*  more pernicious when we look at race.
*  We have a small few that own an enormous amount of our nation's wealth, and that small few
*  is overwhelmingly white.
*  So we can have racial justice where we would have a more fair distribution of wealth and
*  that would be great, but that still wouldn't achieve economic justice.
*  So in the dimensions of wealth, we need to be concerned with both economic and racial
*  justice.
*  Just imagine as a thought experiment, we passed a policy that really solved or deeply narrowed
*  and we'll talk about a policy like this, the median wealth gap, right?
*  So the typical black household, the typical white household, now they look pretty similar
*  or much more similar at least from wealth, but does nothing really on the mean wealth
*  gap because you know, your Bill Gates is and your Elon Musk's and so on, right?
*  They're unaffected by this policy.
*  And so on the one hand, you have really dramatically changed the wealth gap on one measure and
*  barely changed it on another.
*  What have we solved in that world and what haven't we solved?
*  We haven't solved economic justice.
*  Now we've redressed racial justice, which again would be no small feat.
*  And if I were to flip your framing slightly, Ezra, and say we can close the mean racial
*  wealth gap hypothetically by creating simply a class of black billionaires so that the
*  mean distribution across race was equal, but that would still leave large racial disparities
*  between the typical experience.
*  In other words, a handful of black billionaires would not solve our problem, but could at
*  least in theory close the racial wealth gap.
*  I'll add one other thing to make the point crystal clear.
*  The mean wealth of a white family in America is close to a million dollars.
*  We know that the typical experience of a white family is not a millionaire experience, but
*  that's because of that high concentration of wealth that drags the distribution in a
*  skewed way towards a million dollars.
*  The more typical experience of a white household is in the hundreds of thousand range.
*  I believe it's closer to $200,000.
*  So if we were to use the mean and not the median, we would not exactly be using the
*  accurate pinpoint to understand the typical experience between a black and white household.
*  One of the reasons I think the black-white wealth gap is unusually important to focus
*  on as a question of racial justice is that it's where the story of our past compounds
*  into our present.
*  You've done a lot of work on both the shape of it now, but the causes of it.
*  How do you understand how America ended up with a wealth gap like we have?
*  Many of us are well familiar with our history, and we know that America has had a sordid
*  history in its treatment of black people, beginning with slavery.
*  And it's been characterized as the original sin of America, where you had people literally
*  living in bondage and serving as capital assets for a white landowning plantation class.
*  We also know, and we let this conversation up, with how wealth is generated.
*  It's generated mostly passive.
*  We know that it's intergenerational, that households that have children are able to
*  bequest to their children a capital foundation that allows them to not only have wealth,
*  but grow their wealth.
*  So we understand how wealth is created, and we understand the history of America is such
*  that black people started out in bondage.
*  And then another pivotal point that should be made is that a white asset-based middle
*  class didn't simply emerge.
*  It was public policy, policies like the Homestead Act, policies like the GI Bill, establishments
*  like fair housing authorities that facilitated long-term mortgages at very low interest rates,
*  that provided the capital and the structure so that white families can get into things
*  like a home.
*  And in the case of a GI Bill, a college degree without the albatross of educational debt
*  to get into a managerial professional occupation.
*  Ira Katznelson has a phenomenal book called When Affirmative Action Was White, which really
*  lays this out.
*  What Ira Katznelson also describes in this book is the ways in which that policy was
*  or that set of policies were designed, implemented, and managed that benefited white people and
*  to a large extent excluded black people.
*  So let's give an example.
*  Imagine a Jim Crow context for which one is trying to apply their GI Bill to purchase
*  a home in an area.
*  Well, the choice set that you have to purchase a home is much more limited if you're black.
*  The access to go to a bank and receive a loan to provide a mortgage associated with that
*  initial capital is very different if you're black.
*  I think the estimate that Ira Katznelson offers when we think simply about higher education
*  and not even homeownership, that the GI Bill provided enough capital for Americans to rival
*  that that we spent on the Marshall Plan that played a large part in rebuilding Europe.
*  So this surge of government resources enabled a population and also enabled institutions
*  that benefited white people at the exclusion of black people.
*  When black people were able to accumulate assets, when they were able to overcome circumstances
*  and actually accumulate wealth, it never received the political codification to be
*  immune from malfeasance, terror, threats, and outright thefts the ways that white people
*  property ownership was afforded.
*  A big example would be Tulsa, Oklahoma, when we had the race massacre in which a community
*  that was at least working to middle class was decimated overnight.
*  And then of course this was not isolated.
*  There were many examples where physical destruction, even if it's not leading to the actual physical
*  terrorism that decimated Tulsa, Oklahoma for black people, the threat of violence, the
*  threat that if you don't engage in a certain way, if you don't act a certain way, if you
*  are not kept in your place, you literally could lose your life.
*  That has impacts on a community and on a population's ability to generate wealth.
*  So this is our sordid history.
*  But what is important for this conversation that we're having, Ezra, is that the paramount
*  indicator of not just economic security, but economics agency in one's life has been structured
*  in America through public policy such that we have this large gap of about one dime for
*  every dollar, which is an implicit economic indicator of our historical past.
*  One statistic I've seen you use that I find unbelievably striking here, because I think
*  the myth in America, the belief oftentimes, is look, you get a college education, get
*  a job, you get ahead.
*  And that's available to anybody now, even if it always hasn't been.
*  But something that you and call those have found is that households in America headed
*  by white high school dropouts have more wealth on average than households headed by black
*  college graduates.
*  That's pretty remarkable.
*  And that's the beauty of trying to describe that we have structural racism in America.
*  You can simply point to descriptive indicators that we all associate as the keys to success
*  and find out that not only do we have disparities across race at various indicators of whether
*  you're married, not married, highly educated, not highly educated, formerly incarcerated,
*  incarcerated, but these disparities grow as we move up into higher status indicators.
*  So the disparities across wealth get larger at higher levels of education.
*  The disparities across wealth don't subside when people get married, they actually get
*  larger.
*  With the statistic you cited earlier, you can look at the highest status indicator for
*  black people like a college degree, like being married or whatever the domain we want
*  to look at and look at the lower indicator for white individuals and see that in something
*  like wealth, the disparities are often such that the white person is better off in wealth
*  than the black person, even though the black person has the highest status indicator.
*  It dispels this myth, this notion that all you have to do is do these things and you'll
*  be fine.
*  Of course within group, more education is associated with better outcomes, but across
*  groups the disparities remain and even get larger and that's not a coincidence, that's
*  a structure.
*  One point you've made is that one thing you see in the data is that the reason it's often
*  hard for black families to build wealth and this gets to this whole broader context you're
*  describing is that as they do build wealth, there are more people who need their help
*  in their communities and their families and so there tends to be more, if you're somebody
*  who you're part of a middle class or upper middle class family and you get some money,
*  odds are that people around you don't need it that much, but if you're somebody who's
*  the only person in your family who's gotten to college and it was a huge effort for the
*  family to put you through college and now you're a doctor let's say, but a lot of people
*  around you don't have much and they need help with medical bills or fall behind on rent
*  or whatever and you need to help them, that puts a break on wealth accumulation that somebody
*  from a wealthier family just doesn't have as much of.
*  I was curious if you could talk a bit about that dynamic and what you see of it.
*  And of course that's personal.
*  I've been able to acquire resources in ways that other people in my family have not, both
*  immediate as well as extended family and I well understand the demands to want to provide
*  for others so that they can have a good economic experience and not be vulnerable.
*  Altruism isn't a problem, that's a good thing, but it's a problem that these structures of
*  inequality extend well beyond the individual but have large spillover effects as well.
*  So one thing I take from all this is that it's just really hard to change wealth distribution,
*  that you actually need real policy to do it and just something we were talking about earlier,
*  we have put a lot of policy into place to do it, we have all these tax breaks, we've
*  also cut the estate tax a lot over time so we're taxing wealth a lot less than we have
*  at other points in American history.
*  But you have a pretty big policy idea that has been taken up in Congress that would do
*  quite a bit here called baby bonds.
*  So tell me about the baby bonds concept.
*  Baby bonds just recognizes the ways in which wealth is generated.
*  Wealth begets more wealth.
*  We know that the difference between low wealth and high wealth individuals began with capital.
*  So what baby bonds does is it provides a birthright to capital.
*  It says, irrespective of the economic situation in which you're born into, we will endow you
*  with capital such that when you become a young adult, you can purchase an asset that provides
*  that passive savings, that passive appreciation where you get economic security, you get economic
*  agency that comes along with wealth as a birthright.
*  So how much capital are we talking about?
*  Conceptually enough so that the individual, when they become a young adult, can be able
*  to get an education without debt, have a down payment to get into a home, or some capital
*  to be able to bridge with a business loan to start a business.
*  That's the idea.
*  The program is structured such that the average account would be about $25,000, but they could
*  rise upwards to $50,000 for those that are born into the most wealth poor family.
*  Now that's the policy described at the federal level.
*  If we think about state level policies where they don't have the purchasing power that
*  the federal government has, they are constrained in an annual way based on their budgets.
*  We've seen places like Connecticut be able to come up with an endowment of about $3,200
*  for all Medicaid-born babies.
*  So Connecticut, Washington, D.C., and various other states, they're not waiting on the federal
*  legislation.
*  They're beginning to try to redress intergenerational poverty given the constraints of their fiscal
*  budgets with as little as $3,200 at birth.
*  And that $3,200 at birth, it'll be managed similar to other state pension programs where
*  the treasurer of those states or those localities try to grow the accounts as large as possible.
*  And there are estimates that in the case of Connecticut, a child born into poverty, as
*  measured by being a Medicaid birth, could have about $10,000 when they become a young
*  adult to contribute towards some down payment, some nest egg so that they can build wealth.
*  Let's hold on the bigger proposal, the federal proposal for a minute, the one that could
*  be up to $50,000 for somebody born into the most wealth-poor households.
*  So as I understand it, there are strictures on what you can use that money for.
*  You know, you can use it to go to college, you can use it to buy a house, you couldn't
*  use it, I guess, to invest in Bitcoin or to fund your gaming habit or to buy gym membership
*  or just to help out your family members, right?
*  I don't want to put this all as leisure spending.
*  Why?
*  Why not trust people to spend the money the way they need to spend it?
*  And let's be fair, this policy will not be, I'll use this word again, the panacea to redress
*  all of the economic insecurity that we have.
*  There is the difference between income and wealth, and both are critical and important
*  for individual, family, and community well-being.
*  So the program is restricted not to be paternalistic, but to ensure that it's being promoted in
*  a way to actually build wealth.
*  We gave the example of being born into families that are not so affluent, thereby might very
*  well require needs on individuals that are able to attain social mobility.
*  You know, if you would have offered me a baby bond when I was a young adult, when I was
*  coming into the working age of my life, graduating from college, graduating from school, it's
*  likely I would have had a relative who could have used that money in order to avoid some
*  really detrimental circumstance, like being evicted, like being able to pay a light bill,
*  like being able to address some of their immediate income needs.
*  Now, those things are critical and important, and I would have been happy to be able to
*  make those contributions if I had the money.
*  However, it wouldn't have grown my wealth.
*  So I think we need to restrict the accounts not because we don't trust people to make
*  astute decisions for themselves, because we need public policies that are really aimed
*  at the attribute for which we want to address.
*  That's the whole purpose of why you might want to restrict it.
*  So in the first part of our conversation, we talked about the size of wealth inequality
*  in America.
*  We talked about the black-white wealth gap in its mean and median forms.
*  Some analyses have been run on this idea.
*  What would this do for those?
*  Which gaps would it close and which gaps would it not?
*  Naomi Zote, she has this great simulation study that projects the impact of baby bonds
*  on the black-white wealth gap.
*  And she calculates that for recipients of the account, the young adults that would actually
*  receive the account, it would cut the racial wealth gap in half by 50%.
*  And that's one generation.
*  And what it can do for subsequent generations, it can trend us towards closing the racial
*  wealth gap.
*  And we've been focusing on race, but there's a lot of wealth-poor white individuals in
*  this country as well.
*  And they absolutely would benefit.
*  So to me, this would be a program that is an automatic stabilizer in the sense that
*  not just for the immediate recipient generation, but future generations as well.
*  And to the extent that capital grows and generates inequality in America, we have
*  a policy that in perpetuity trends us towards a society that affords people, regardless
*  of the income that they're born with, the race in which they're born, to have access
*  to something as critical as capital so that they can actually have an opportunity to build
*  wealth.
*  So the numbers we're talking about here for the poorest families are pretty big, $50,000.
*  And I think it is reasonable for somebody to hear that and say, yeah, it'd be nice,
*  but there's no way we can afford to functionally have...
*  I like to think of this as a universal basic wealth program.
*  What would the cost of it be?
*  And how could it be paid for?
*  So I got two lines of critique.
*  One is the universal basic wealth aspect.
*  It's universal in the sense that everybody would have access to wealth.
*  It would not be basic in the sense that everybody wouldn't get the same level of wealth as an
*  endowment.
*  But the main question that you raised, and we should address it, the cost of the program
*  would be $100 billion in total.
*  $100 billion seems like a big number.
*  $50,000 to the most wealth-poor person seems like a big number.
*  But we need to put that number in context.
*  Let's put that number in the context of one of the ways in which we began this conversation.
*  The federal government is already subsidizing the assets of American people to the tune
*  of well over $700 billion a year.
*  So we actually can afford to pay for this.
*  We actually have already spending in effect that's promoting asset development.
*  So with the existing pool of resources that we're using in the tax code, we could take
*  a portion of that and do something as dramatic as redress these problems that we started
*  off talking about.
*  This massive wealth inequality that we began with, this racial wealth gap that has been
*  structured in an immoral way since the inception of our country.
*  So to me, there's a lot of good news for $100 billion.
*  We really can achieve an egalitarian society that affords everyone the benefits that come
*  along with wealth.
*  I think one worry here would be, so imagine we pass it tomorrow.
*  You have this generation of kids when they turn 18, they have 50,000 or 50,000 that's
*  been growing in the markets, more or less depending on where they started out.
*  And now all of a sudden, you have this profusion of say, higher ed educations that know there's
*  this whole generation that's about to graduate with more money, particularly people who maybe
*  wouldn't have had access to places like them beforehand.
*  Or that all these people have money burning in their pockets and they want to try to convert
*  it to money they can use.
*  So somehow maybe they could pull on a house, but they can't spend it on many things.
*  You can imagine two things happening here.
*  I think one is a lot of predation and the other is inflation.
*  And I think that's a particular concern in higher education where we've seen that before,
*  if there's a lot more money people can simply spend on higher education.
*  The higher ed organizations raise prices and figure out ways to park people without money
*  without necessarily giving them a lot more for the dollar.
*  So when you're talking about a big bang policy like this, how do you make sure it doesn't
*  just get eaten up by highly informed, clever, and not even always malicious, just self-interested
*  actors?
*  I mean, Ezra, I think you're spot on with that question.
*  And I think it's a huge concern.
*  We know history has taught us that two forms.
*  One is if we know there's going to be a cash infusion into a population, a great deal of
*  individuals, corporations, and other institutions are going to figure out ways in which they
*  can usurp some of those resources in order to benefit themselves.
*  And the potential biggest predator in this program very well could be universities and
*  colleges that simply inflate their tuition to absorb the accounts in a way that it doesn't
*  have a real effect.
*  So to redress that, you will definitely need to include financial protections in the program.
*  One of the benefits of, say, the investments going towards a home, it wouldn't be enough
*  resources to literally purchase a home.
*  It will require some form of a mortgage.
*  So through federal protections to define what are the criteria to receive that mortgage
*  and the criteria by which banks and other financial institutions could issue that mortgage,
*  that becomes another check by which government can regulate the program in a positive way.
*  Similarly, if you go get a business loan, you can't get a loan for just any business.
*  There's some criteria.
*  So that becomes another implicit check to redress some of the potential financial malfeasance,
*  especially if government regulates the type of loans that can be coupled with the account.
*  Let me also say that it would be great if this program was coupled with other programs
*  like tuition-free public education.
*  I think in the 21st century, we need things well beyond baby bonds.
*  We need a package of public goods aimed at ensuring that people have the essential resource
*  without which they simply are vulnerable.
*  And capital is clearly one.
*  And in the 21st century, not just a high school degree, but a college degree becomes another
*  essential element.
*  So if you had tuition-free public universities, that would be a constraint on tuition costs
*  that could avoid some of that inflation that you've been describing.
*  And then one other feature of the program, I don't think we should require people to
*  use the accounts once they turn 18.
*  Indeed, there should be provisions for an account that provides a normal rate of return
*  and be accessible for when the child becomes an adult and also is ready to use the account.
*  So another criticism is wealth inequality is bad, wealth concentration is bad, but for
*  everything we talked about earlier, there are distinctive dynamics to the black-white
*  wealth gap that reflect specific historical horrors visited upon black Americans.
*  And so a race-neutral policy simply isn't the right way to approach that.
*  How do you think about that?
*  You know, I'm an advocate for reparations.
*  I think reparations and baby bonds address complementary things, but not the same things.
*  Paraphrase is a retrospective racially just program that does two things.
*  It requires atonement.
*  It requires truth and reconciliation.
*  It requires the federal government to take public account and atone for the state-complicit
*  malfeasance that have taken place in the past and led to the conditions that exist today.
*  So that's not empty.
*  That's valuable because a lot of the rhetoric by which we make policy today is grounded
*  in narratives and norms.
*  And it's often grounded in narratives and norms that position black people as deadbeats,
*  as welfare queens, as predators themselves, as undeserving, undesirable, as a drain on
*  public budgets.
*  Now of course that doesn't just affect black people.
*  That limits our ability to deal with white poverty as well.
*  So that reparations leads to a different framing and understanding of both poverty and inequality
*  that not only offers dignity to a population that has been stigmatized, that has been demonized
*  throughout American history, but also creates new pathways and understanding in a more accurate
*  and a more just way of thinking about poverty and inequality, not just for black people,
*  but for all people going forward.
*  Whether we're ready for it today or ready for it tomorrow, we should commit to it and
*  commit to it as a movement because it is the right thing to do.
*  That should be reason enough.
*  But it will not be enough to really provide for the economic security and the access to
*  wealth in a forward-looking way.
*  It will redress the past and it will put black and white people on far more even kill
*  in both economic and political contexts.
*  But we know what capital does.
*  Capital consolidates, iterates, and it excludes.
*  In other words, wealth begets more wealth and wealth builds upon itself.
*  So even if we redress the past, going forward, capital will concentrate among certain entities
*  in American society and we need a natural stabilizer.
*  We need an automatic stabilizer.
*  We need a public policy that in perpetuity ensures that everyone has access to a capital
*  foundation, particularly in their formative years of being a young adult so as to build
*  wealth.
*  It will go well beyond subsistence programs, which are critical and necessary, but really
*  will not build wealth.
*  Let me ask about one final example before we wrap up here, which you talk about in your
*  paper, which is Seed OK, the seed for Oklahoma kids experiment.
*  They were putting for at least for a treatment group, $1,000 into a 529 savings account,
*  the kind of account we talked about earlier for pretty poor kids.
*  And then they tracked what happened to that treatment group and their parents against
*  groups that didn't get that $1,000.
*  What did they find?
*  You know, the great lessons from that Seed OK experiment, they could inform us about
*  baby bonds.
*  In addition to the wealth building attributes associated with baby bonds, the Seed OK showed
*  us that families knowing that their child is going to receive this endowment when they
*  become a young adult, invested more in that child, tried to promote that child to double
*  down on their education.
*  Children had better grades as a result from that endowment than they otherwise would have
*  without that endowment.
*  Children had better outlooks on life.
*  They had higher aspirations, knowing that they were going to receive that account when
*  they became an adult.
*  You know, the good thing about baby bonds is it has spillover effects well beyond promoting
*  the wealth of an individual that receives the account.
*  It can literally change the horizon by which poor families and Black families engage with
*  the state.
*  These are groups that are often engaged in punitive ways with the state, where the state
*  is imposing a fine, where the state is saying, you can and can't do this.
*  If the state were to offer an endowment, I think it will promote civic engagement.
*  I think that Black families, poor families, and other marginalized families will see the
*  state in a different light, and it will lead to more civic engagement, which will benefit
*  us all as a society.
*  It will also change the horizon of that child with regards to things like education.
*  If you're going to receive an endowment, you very well might be incentivized to invest
*  in attributes like schooling such that you'll benefit to a greater extent from that endowment
*  when you become a young adult.
*  In addition to changing the horizon by which a family thinks of the state so as to promote
*  civic engagement, it also can create more touch points in a positive way by which the
*  state can engage with families in a productive way.
*  I suspect that prenatal care will become greater utilized amongst low-income families as a
*  result of baby bonds.
*  If an expectant mother understands that this account is being established, well, it creates
*  an opportunity where we literally could send out literature promoting these are the types
*  of steps that you should pursue in order to have a healthy child, which could promote
*  more healthy children and greater lifestyles going forward.
*  But it need not end at prenatal care.
*  Just like social security, where we get estimates of our social security accounts periodically,
*  and it provides a point in which the state can send literature and information to households,
*  we can use the point of baby bonds to have positive interface of the state and the population
*  so as to promote more healthy living for the recipients in our society at large.
*  I think that's a great place to end.
*  So as our final question, what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Three books.
*  Well, you heard me talk about When Affirmative Action Was White by Ira Katznelson.
*  I mean, that is foundational for me.
*  It's foundational for me because it demonstrates what government can do in order to promote
*  the human rights of all of us, to promote a great society for all of us.
*  The lesson from Affirmative Action Was White was that if we're going to do it this time,
*  we need to make sure that we design, implement, and manage the policies not in an exclusive
*  way, but in an inclusive way.
*  The second book, which is foundational for me, is Racial Conflict and Economic Development
*  by Arthur Lewis.
*  Anybody trying to understand the intersections of politics, economics, and identity group
*  stratification or racial disparity, I highly recommend that you read that book.
*  And then finally, a book that I've read more recently by Natalie Diaz, who is an indigenous
*  poet.
*  The book is called Post-Colonial Love Poems.
*  Natalie has this incredible way of presenting social theory in prose, in ways that link
*  people to the environment.
*  It has had huge impact in my understanding about society in general, and it did it with
*  poetry in a way that words themselves matter in our understanding and are critical if we
*  want to come up with social policies to move to a better society.
