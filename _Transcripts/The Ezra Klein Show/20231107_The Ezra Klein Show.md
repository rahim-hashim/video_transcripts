# An Intense, Searching Conversation With Amjad Iraqi
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9dq90PihU)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  I'm just going to try to say what we're doing this week as clearly as I can.
*  There's going to have to be a stable coexistence of narratives.
*  There's a line I love from Yossi Klein Alibi's book, Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor,
*  where he writes, quote,
*  So you could think of the episodes this week as a matched pair.
*  You could think of it as one episode in two parts, but one is going to be on this moment
*  and the background to it through Palestinian eyes, and the other on this moment and the
*  background to it through Israeli eyes.
*  Obviously, nobody can speak for a whole people.
*  These are just what they claim to be.
*  Historically and journalistically informed perspectives, there are many more.
*  I didn't find everything in these conversations easy to hear.
*  I doubt you will either.
*  I didn't agree with everything I heard.
*  And I doubt you will either.
*  But that's not the spirit in which I'm trying to do these.
*  The point, at least for me, is to simply try and hold these perspectives at the same time,
*  because somehow this land, this cursed, sacred, bloody scar of land, is going to have to hold
*  them and more.
*  My guest today is Amjad Araki.
*  He's a senior editor at 972 Magazine and a policy analyst at the think tank Al-Shabaka.
*  He's written for the London Review of Books and The Guardian and formerly worked at Adala,
*  the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel.
*  I appreciated him having this conversation with me.
*  This is not easy stuff to talk about.
*  I got a lot from it and I hope that you do too.
*  As always, my email, azraklineshow.nytimes.com.
*  I'm Amjad Araki.
*  Welcome to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  So I wanted to begin with what Gaza looked like before the attack on 10-7.
*  And I want to, I guess, begin with a more simple question, which is, what was Gaza?
*  I mean, Gaza as we know it today is almost like an imaginary construct.
*  Historically, there was Gaza City.
*  It wasn't a strip.
*  It was a part of what was regarded as historical Palestine that, you know, through different
*  empires and rulers of the years, you know, was this kind of coastal area, which was also
*  one of the sort of port cities and had these other kind of rural areas around it, and was
*  very much one of the major points of Palestinian Arab history in that land.
*  This all naturally changed in 1948 with regard to the Arab-Israeli War or what Palestinians
*  refer to as the Nakba or the catastrophe.
*  And whereby after that war, you had Palestine split apart by enormous lines that were created
*  between the newfound Israeli state and the Arab states around it.
*  And at the time, Gaza was then put onto the Egyptian side.
*  And that formulated that sort of slot of land that we know of today and its shape.
*  Most of the populations since 1948 have been refugees or descendants of Palestinian refugees
*  who were either fled or were expelled during that 1948 war.
*  And a lot of these people can literally see the lands from which their families came from
*  just a few kilometers or miles away.
*  And even to this day, those descendants are still living in what are regarded as refugee
*  which now look like permanent settlements in a way, like permanent communities or towns
*  and villages.
*  But they still strongly identify themselves as refugees.
*  I think something like two thirds of the Gaza Strip's population are technically not from
*  that area.
*  And Gaza has always been very much at the center of or one of the kind of pillars of
*  Palestinian identity, a Palestinian memory of the region.
*  And certainly in terms of politics and identity and resistance, Gaza has always been very
*  much at the front in many ways of initiating that or producing Palestinians who created
*  different kinds of politics and so on.
*  I'm emphasizing this especially because it's become this tendency to think of the Gaza
*  Strip as something separate from Palestine and something separate from the Palestinian
*  people in history.
*  But it's really vital to understand how central it is to it.
*  Now all this has very much been, let's say, deformed after the 1967 occupation and even
*  more so since the blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2007, whereby the Gaza that we see today
*  is one that is completely engaged by a blockade that was initiated after the Islamist movement
*  Hamas took over the Strip, which itself came after Hamas won democratic elections to the
*  Palestinian government, which was then met by international sanctions led by the Bush
*  administration and then the Western backed coup by the rival party Fatah, which is led
*  by Mahmoud Abbas and governs the West Bank.
*  And that blockade has basically been de-developed since 2007.
*  So the infrastructure and the towns and communities access to basic services have been crippling
*  along the way because of the blockade and its restrictions on movement, on people, on
*  goods and really formulating this cage and in a very deliberate policy to try to separate
*  Gaza and Hamas, but especially Gaza as a unit, away from the Palestinian people.
*  So I want to zoom in on two periods here and the first is when Gaza moves from Egyptian
*  control to Israeli control.
*  I think it's also important for people to realize that Gaza is somewhat, it's almost
*  co-managed between Egypt and Israel even now.
*  So what happens in that moment?
*  How does Gaza go from being something that Egypt has authority over to something that
*  Israel is now controlling?
*  So in June 1967, you had the Six-Day War between Israel and surrounding Arab states and within
*  the space of a week, Israel had basically conquered the West Bank from Jordan, the Golan
*  Heights from Syria, and then the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.
*  And this was kind of quite a shocking victory on Israel's end.
*  Later on, the Sinai was eventually ceded back in negotiations with Anwar Sadat, the president
*  of Egypt in the 70s.
*  This was the Camp David Accords.
*  And for Egypt and Israel, and there's been some fantastic research about this, but just
*  explaining how that the armistice line was then redrawn to the Gaza Strip.
*  And so this is how you kind of formulated that agreement between Israel and Egypt, that
*  Gaza's future lay with the Palestinian people, not with Egypt.
*  You mentioned this research about how Gaza becomes seen as something that's not going
*  to in some kind of deal go back to Egypt, but becomes part of Palestine.
*  And so it becomes a sort of, I don't want to call it unwanted, but Egypt also does not
*  end up wanting to control Gaza.
*  What is that research?
*  What is the narrative of that?
*  I mean, the huge part of the Palestinian question, especially on the Israeli side, is to try
*  to make the Palestinian issue an Arab problem.
*  So it's always about trying to sort of cast it off to the Arab states, even hoping like
*  in the West Bank that Jordan would just take all the Palestinians and that would be done
*  with it.
*  But the Palestinians themselves, you know, from the very get go have always resisted
*  this kind of geopolitical game that's been played with them.
*  Even Arab states, which have always had their own agendas and kind of larger visions of
*  the regional architecture, still understood, especially both by the Palestinians who were
*  resisting on the ground, but also a lot of the Arab publics, which to this day are still
*  heavily sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, that the Palestinians needed to be able to
*  assert themselves in their own homeland, that their struggle lay with the future in their
*  land and not just to be kind of dispersed and diluted into this Arab region.
*  So after the trauma of the Nakba, that that became basically from the 60s, the Palestinians
*  were really kind of taking a much more concerted, organized agency in order to make the world
*  sort of not forget them.
*  Like after 1948, that it wasn't just a done deal and that Palestinians weren't going to
*  be silenced in that respect or just kind of melt away into the region, that they still
*  had aspirations for their own homeland.
*  So Palestinians themselves made it impossible for these other Arab capitals and for the
*  Israeli states to completely ignore them.
*  But for a whole host of reasons, it did not go the way that at least Palestinians have
*  been hoping to.
*  So go back to 2006 here, there are elections held in Gaza.
*  To some degree, one of the big movers here is a Bush administration over the objections
*  of some who they really want elections.
*  Hamas wins the election.
*  What is Hamas and what is Hamas at that point and why do they win?
*  So Hamas is like a Palestinian Islamist movement.
*  And those two need to be combined because there's a tendency to sort of just kind of
*  dismiss it as kind of like another one of these Islamist groups that has these grand
*  Islamic caliphate sort of visions for the region.
*  But Hamas has always been very concerted about defining itself as a particularly national
*  movement for the Palestinians.
*  And yes, it has connections to other Islamists.
*  It has a history with the Muslim Brotherhood, for example, and obviously tied in with a
*  lot of Arab capitals and even Iran, for example.
*  But its goal is very much focused on Palestine.
*  And so it originated basically almost like a social movement, I think, back in the 70s
*  or even 80s.
*  The early incarnations of it was recognized in NGO even by the Israeli occupation authorities.
*  And then through a couple of processes, you end up having Hamas emerging out, especially
*  out of the first intifada in the late 80s, seeing itself as kind of like a religious
*  political model, you know, or a political Islamist model, and one especially that was
*  grounded in historic Palestine itself, in the occupied territories, which was different
*  from the PLO, which was very much born in exile and by the refugees abroad.
*  And in addition to that kind of political Islam, they were also trying to create this
*  challenge to the PLO, which they were seeing as shifting its politics as we would eventually
*  see with Yasser Arafat moving towards recognition of the two-state solution, the signing of
*  the Oslo Accords, the renouncing of armed struggle.
*  And Hamas has always been very insistent that in addition to its political agenda, that
*  armed struggle needs to be an integral part of Palestinian resistance.
*  So this is what really set it apart or tried to define itself as being set apart from the
*  Fatah party, which governed the PLO.
*  And it's evolved over the years and it's a very complex organization.
*  And Tariq Bakouni wrote a really fantastic book about this called Hamas Contained, where
*  he really provides like a very great complex analysis of how it was born and fantastic
*  details.
*  And it's important to think of it as a monolith, you know, whether you're a proof of the movement
*  or not.
*  It has a political bureau, it has armed wing, it has a debate and these mechanisms that
*  are all around it.
*  Hamas really defined itself in the 90s with these, with its military struggle, especially
*  of the suicide bombings, which became notorious, including during the second Intifada.
*  But then in the 2005-2006 elections, it came like this test to see like, okay, what if
*  we try to use these democratic models?
*  What if we focus on the political rather than the armed struggle and try to really center
*  ourselves at the center of the Palestinian national movement, not just to have Fatah
*  or the PLO dominate, but to be able to really reflect these other political ideas.
*  So it sees itself as trying to become part of this wider spectrum.
*  But the response has just been complete blockage by Fatah, which still sees itself as kind
*  of almost like the sole leader, the sole monopolizer of Palestinian politics.
*  At the time by international actors, which especially under the rubric of the war on
*  terror was almost like refusing to have any conversations with political Islamist movements,
*  let alone ones that maintained an armed struggle.
*  For Hamas's experience, the fact that they participated in elections, won the parliament,
*  and then were sanctioned and then basically ousted from government is for them an indication
*  that they cannot let go of armed struggle.
*  And this is why they very much unlike Fatah and the PLO, they're still holding onto it.
*  And that's one of the things that has also helped it to maintain a certain status in
*  Palestinian society, where even those who disagree with Hamas ideologically or in its
*  political moves feel that Hamas is still one of the only movements that are still incurring
*  a cost on the Israeli occupation in a way that Fatah no longer is, that the PLO no longer is.
*  So two things in there that I want to go into in more detail.
*  So one, after Hamas wins, there's a blockade imposed by Israel.
*  The blockade is also enforced by Egypt, by international actors.
*  And there is this war that happens with Fatah.
*  Can you talk a bit about both what the blockade is and also why Egypt participates in it?
*  And then also the war with Fatah, what happens there?
*  So you have the 2005 election, which gets Mahmoud Abbas as president, and then the 2006
*  one where Hamas wins the legislature.
*  And it was very clear from the outset that neither Fatah nor its Western sponsors were
*  going to be accepting of this scenario.
*  Even though Hamas was playing the political game as demanded, the very fact that they
*  could have such popular support and win even by the rules of the game was just unacceptable.
*  And so in the months that ensued afterwards, you basically had the constant tensions, the
*  sanctions that were imposed by the European Union, by the Bush administration, just made
*  it impossible for Hamas even function in government.
*  Like it became almost designed to fail.
*  And all this ended up happening whereby both Fatah and Hamas, with their different sort
*  of security forces or armed groups, ended up almost fighting out into the streets, especially
*  in Gaza, and Hamas won that battle.
*  And then this kind of gave the pretext for Israel to completely enforce this full-on
*  siege.
*  And then we're talking about severe restrictions at the border crossings, both in terms of
*  making it almost impossible for people to get in and out.
*  And this in addition to just general goods and just basic trade, like Gaza used to be
*  a parcel of the economy of the West Bank and also inside Israel during the Oslo period,
*  people used to be able to go in and out of Gaza.
*  And then the moment that that blockade, and even just the months and years before, like
*  when the closure started being in place, it became this highly isolated kind of territorial
*  island in a way.
*  And for Palestinians in Gaza who've been experiencing the siege, we're talking about an entire generation
*  who've never been out of that strip and who've never seen another Palestinian from the West
*  Bank who only know Israelis through the tanks and the fighter jets and the Israeli snipers
*  at the border.
*  This is kind of the harrowing reality.
*  And with each passing year, and especially as the military assaults kept bombarding Gaza,
*  it wasn't able to even reconstruct or even, again, like for young Palestinians, especially
*  to even envision a future outside of this cage in which they're born in.
*  So this is the very harrowing reality that Israel especially has specifically designed.
*  And for Egypt, Egypt's presidency, whether it was Mubarak or Sisi today, and with the
*  capital Muslim Brotherhood in the middle, they despise political Islamists.
*  They themselves are trying to fight them back in Egyptian territory, including in the Sinai.
*  So there are no friends of Hamas.
*  And for all the lip service that Egypt also provides for the Palestinian cause, they also
*  have geopolitical interests and they're more interested in the alliance with Israel in
*  many respects and its backing and especially the backing of the United States compared
*  to really assisting the Palestinian people.
*  And it fluctuates.
*  And sometimes the presidents have, like Sisi and I was concerned about how the Egyptian
*  public will respond to this, to what's happening right now.
*  But these are the complex games where Palestinians are kind of, especially those in Gaza, are
*  really just kept hostage by the geopolitical games.
*  So one thing I want to be attentive to in this conversation is the way that the narratives
*  and the experiences behind those narratives conflict.
*  And so I think the dominant Israeli narrative, it's fair to say, is something like in 05,
*  Israel withdraws from Gaza.
*  Gazans choose Hamas.
*  Palestinians more broadly in 06 choose Hamas for parliament, but it ends up being in Gaza
*  where that is sustained.
*  Hamas is an organization that is an existential security threat to Israel.
*  known for the suicide bombings, which are a generational trauma for Israelis.
*  And so Gaza needs to be treated as a kind of hostile space, right?
*  An existential threat.
*  So that I think is the way Israelis see it, or these Jewish Israelis see it.
*  What is the dominant Palestinian narrative here?
*  I recognize that might overlap with some things you've said, but I just want to try to put
*  it in one place.
*  I mean, it's a convenient narrative for Israelis to kind of center it around Hamas and the
*  center around terrorism.
*  Like, the Gaza Strip existed before Hamas was established in the 80s.
*  Right now in the Israeli mindset, is that conflation or that excuse of using kind of
*  like an armed political group to be able to decimate an entire society, I think really
*  needs to be broken down.
*  And a lot of people abroad, sadly, are sort of buying into it.
*  And just to put this into context as well, it's you have, let's say, kind of three streams
*  or models of which politics can be waged that we're seeing right now.
*  So you have Hamas, which is stuck with armed struggle, armed violence, or quote unquote
*  terrorism, as is defined abroad by Israel.
*  You have Fatah, which especially since the Oslo Accords and under Mahmoud Abbas, Israel
*  has focused on kind of leading the political struggle through like diplomacy.
*  So going to the UN, going to the ICC, focusing on these international forums, all while still
*  keeping to the provisions of the Oslo Accords, like security coordination with Israeli military,
*  keeping its end of the bargain by playing that game.
*  But what they're finding is that even that is now being defined as diplomatic terrorism,
*  that even the PA's model is actually basically roundly dismissed, is roundly demonized, and
*  you still have the same occupation, not even the same, it's even an entrenching occupation,
*  and that the PA has now become this convenient subcontractor to this regime in the West Bank.
*  And then you have, let's say, a third model of Palestinian politics of like the boycott,
*  and sanctions, using literally the nonviolent methods that all of us were kind of taught
*  are the best way to go, are very moral and righteous, and that is coercion without the
*  same kind of coercion of armed struggle.
*  And what Palestinians are finding is that when you do, when you practice that, you're
*  demonized also as terrorists, and demonized even worse as anti-Semites, because you're
*  using a nonviolent method to try to achieve your rights, and to try to weaken the structures
*  that allow the Israeli occupation to take place.
*  Now, if all of these are defined as unacceptable, not just by Israel, but by, and especially
*  a lot of Western countries which are criminalizing boycotts, and they're not giving Fatah and the PA
*  the diplomatic victories or providing them anything beyond just money to supply to the
*  Palestinians, and at the same time, they're violently going against Hamas, Palestinians
*  are saying, so what options do we have left?
*  And the only thing that has actually ever really incurred that cost is Hamas's armed
*  struggle.
*  Like, this is one of the perspectives that's very much in the public's mind, and even though
*  the cost of that is borne on Palestinians, it's like, you know, are we going to wait
*  for a slow annihilation or a quick one?
*  Are we going to put up a fight or are we not going to put up a fight?
*  So these are the kind of debates that are happening right now, and Hamas is very conscious
*  of this.
*  Like, as I said, they tried to play the political game back in 2005 and 2006, and what they
*  experienced was complete rebuttal.
*  They even tried, for example, the Great March of Return, and facilitating this march that
*  happened back in 2018, it went on 2019, to try to push against the Gaza offence and this
*  massive civil disobedience and this massive march of really hundreds of thousands of people.
*  And Israeli snipers either killed or maimed hundreds and then injured thousands of Palestinians,
*  and the world just sat by and again defined it as terrorists.
*  So Hamas is also navigating all this and examining it, and it's making its judgments based on
*  that, that nothing's actually working.
*  And for Palestinians now as well, it's like in the wider public, like I said, even those
*  that disagree with the movement or its decisions, but they're asking themselves, like, well,
*  what do we have left?
*  And what Palestinians are realizing is that it's not about the method, it's our very existence
*  that is deemed unacceptable by the Israelis and by a lot of Western powers and people who
*  support them, who see us as disposable and Jews Israelis as the ones who need to be
*  protected and whose rights need to be met first.
*  There's also a more complicated reality that emerges then, I think, in the Israeli narrative
*  between Israel itself and Hamas.
*  You've talked about your colleague, Tarek Baconi's idea of the violent equilibrium that
*  emerges.
*  What is the violent equilibrium?
*  The equilibrium, as Tarek describes it, is this kind of like almost de facto arrangement
*  that was established whereby Hamas and Israel understood that they were going to get into
*  regular confrontations, like armed military confrontations, and that this was almost like
*  a form of communication when, for example, the blockade became a bit too untenable, when
*  there were Israeli domestic political issues, that armed violence would be the way that
*  they renegotiate some of the conditions of the blockade, but that on the whole, the idea
*  was that every now and then they'll negotiate in this tactic, but that the quote unquote
*  calm is what would become the sort of status quo.
*  But this itself was kind of a myth, you know, that this idea of calm, because for the Israelis,
*  they experienced, for the most part, calm.
*  And from the north to the south, most Israelis were able to go about their lives.
*  But in Gaza, the siege is the constant.
*  The structural violence of besiegement is the constant.
*  In the Israeli mindset, this equilibrium was fantastic because they just almost pretended
*  as if Gaza was just static.
*  And they began to believe that actually this kind of de facto arrangement could last forever,
*  that they didn't need to come up with some alternative solution, that this itself was
*  a solution.
*  And this is where it's also very much connected to the way that the occupation is managed
*  in the West Bank, where you have this kind of subcontractor in the PA, that they just
*  govern a few things in the population centers, but it's the Israeli state that controls
*  everything.
*  So it became like an integral part of this maintenance of an apartheid regime, in the
*  same way that we would understand the Bantustans and apartheid in South Africa or elsewhere.
*  But that equilibrium was always very shaky.
*  The equilibrium always came at the cost of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in their daily
*  life and certainly during those bouts of military violence.
*  And October 7th, I think, has very much erased that equilibrium.
*  It's very much erased that arrangement.
*  The Hamas, for whatever reasons, could no longer hold it up.
*  And it has also shocked the Israeli system to understand that something else has to replace
*  it.
*  But unfortunately, what we're seeing now is something even worse in that regard.
*  What I find useful about the idea of the equilibrium is it gets at, I think, a more
*  complicated reality here, which is that the two sides are in relationship and what they
*  do affects the other.
*  And there's sort of two quotes that stick in my mind here.
*  So Netanyahu is widely reported to have said at a Likud meeting when he is asked about
*  allowing Qatari money to go to Hamas.
*  He says, quote, Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state must
*  support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.
*  He goes on to say it's part of our strategy.
*  And then Bezalel Smotrich, who is now the finance minister in Netanyahu's government
*  and has a lot of control over the West Bank, in 2015, he says, the Palestinian authority
*  is a burden.
*  Hamas is an asset.
*  One reason I think that's important is that the relationship between the Israeli government
*  and Hamas becomes more complicated than simple enmity.
*  Is there a way that both sides are benefiting from each other prior to the major attacks?
*  I think they all benefited in many respects.
*  And even those benefits came out of massive asymmetry, but everyone had something to gain
*  from the quote unquote status quo.
*  For someone like Smotrich, the PA is this very frustrating partner.
*  The fact that even though they're almost on an Israeli payroll, but they can still go
*  and sort of go to these diplomatic forums, et cetera, and say all these things about
*  Israel.
*  And for Smotrich, it's just infuriating.
*  But especially when he's come into power, he's realizing how useful they are because
*  they're actually keeping a hold, for the most part, on the Palestinian people, such
*  that the Israeli army doesn't have to do it.
*  It's like a partner that you need, but one of the F2O's have to allow to launch these
*  kind of diplomatic offensives against the state.
*  Hamas is just nice, pure, and simple in the Israeli establishment.
*  It is the embodiment of an evil.
*  It is a clear-cut enemy that you can basically inflict all the violence that you want upon
*  it.
*  You can't really do that with the PA.
*  They know the Fatah always needs it.
*  And they just find the right sort of equilibrium in that respect to keep the PA alive and to
*  keep it functioning because the PA is so dependent.
*  And this is why even to this day, the Fatah leadership can't exist outside of the structure
*  of the occupation right now.
*  And for Hamas, the Gaza Strip allowed it to become almost like a fiefdom of its own, that
*  it gave it some sense of power, and that it was able to create this kind of more sturdy
*  base for it to establish itself, to establish its armed wing more, and to try to tackle
*  the occupation with more control than they otherwise would have.
*  So that arrangement worked for them in that respect.
*  And this is kind of the irony, again, of even a group like Hamas, which for all its talk
*  of resistance, also appreciated the status quo in many respects.
*  And all this fed into this divide-and-conquer strategy.
*  It's your typical story of that for the Israelis, this was a great way to keep the Palestinian
*  leadership divided, to have them each have those separate fiefdoms, and to try to entrench
*  that idea that the West Bank is separate from Gaza, even in the minds of Palestinians, and
*  that the Israelis could manage all this from above.
*  So yeah, everyone set the game for it.
*  And this is what created the quote-unquote calm, especially for Israeli Jewish society.
*  And the violence that was inflicted on Palestinians on a regular basis, including against Gaza
*  with massive wars, even despite occasional rocket attacks or even militant attacks in
*  Israeli cities, that was kind of seen as both physically and psychologically distant for
*  the Israeli state, and for most Jewish Israelis.
*  It's very much part of a doctrine, especially led by Netanyahu, to really erase the occupation
*  from the Israeli mindset, out of sight and out of mind.
*  And I think a lot of people just assumed that this could be sustainable.
*  But again, what happened on October 7th, I think, showed the folly of that.
*  And this is never something static, that even though Palestinian elites can sometimes gain
*  from the system, in the end, the Palestinian public, with the pressures that they're putting
*  on their leaderships, both Hamas and Fatah, and just making the occupation itself untenable,
*  I think is proof that apartheid can't work forever like this.
*  There has been this overwhelming sense that what Israel suffered on 10-7, among other
*  things, was an intelligence failure.
*  But the more I see the reporting on this, the more that doesn't actually seem right to me.
*  They had actually a lot of intelligence.
*  They saw a lot of the training happening in open air.
*  What they had was a political analysis failure.
*  They believed that Hamas was relatively comfortable in the position it was in,
*  that it was not going to want to risk this kind of war with Israel.
*  They did not think Hamas would do something like this.
*  Not that they didn't see them preparing for it, but they didn't believe that they would want to
*  upend the equilibrium in the way they did.
*  So at this point, what is your sense of what they wanted?
*  Why didn't Hamas just want to stay in the position they were in,
*  where Israel was not trying to destroy it root and branch?
*  I mean, you hit at something very important here, whereby even beyond political analysis,
*  there's a deeper psychology that has really taken hold of the Israeli political and military
*  establishment and Israeli society, which, like I said, they thought that this could keep going
*  forever.
*  They couldn't imagine that Hamas wanted anything differently.
*  And that, yes, aside from your occasional confrontations, the idea of Gaza being out of sight,
*  out of mind, actually became the norm.
*  And so, yeah, I think for them, as much as it was a military shock, it was a psychological shock,
*  a barrier really being broken by the fact that Hamas told the Israelis in very violent fashion,
*  we no longer want this to be the case.
*  Now, as to why Hamas decided to pick this moment and even these methods,
*  there are multiple layers of this.
*  In the end, it's not just about Gaza, it's about the wider Palestinian question.
*  You've been seeing, not just in the past years, but even just in the past months,
*  just for a smaller scope, under this Israeli far-right government, which has been very explicit
*  about what it wants to do to the occupied territories, especially in the West Bank,
*  of full force annexation, a judicial coup, which is very much designed and seen as a phase
*  towards the full absorption of the West Bank, a very unabashed envisioning of expelling as
*  many Palestinians as possible, especially by people like Smotrich and Benkver.
*  They're seeing, even before this month, you had West Bank communities, rural ones and villages,
*  who were being chased out by escalating settler violence, all backed up by the army.
*  All this is happening at the same time that you have Arab states, including the expectation that
*  Saudi Arabia was going to be joining onto the Abraham Accords and really taking one of the last
*  pieces of regional leverage that the Palestinian cause still had.
*  This is in addition to local pressures of Palestinians in Gaza, who especially in the
*  past few months, under this total blockade, are still demanding of Hamas as a de facto government
*  to provide more support for basic services, especially with electricity, which is almost
*  impossible to meet in conditions of siege, but that they were still turning to the Hamas
*  government to provide for that in some form or another. You have these local and national
*  and regional factors, which could not make the status quo last any longer. Even though, obviously,
*  this military operation, these assaults were planned well in advance and took a lot of
*  intelligence gathering, etc. It's enwrapped very much in the fact that the Palestinian question
*  and Palestinians were under an existential threat. We're experiencing it in a very expedited form now,
*  but this was happening for months and years on end. I think for a group like Hamas, I can't speak
*  for it, but I think they made the calculation that something had to give, because Hamas could
*  no longer survive as a local government and the Palestinian cause could no longer survive under
*  this far-right government. It could no longer survive if all the Arab governments were turning
*  away from it. What is Hamas's sense of Israel's psychology, and in particular, its relationship
*  to loss? I think this is an uncomfortable thing to talk about, but I do think it needs to be part of
*  trying to figure out what happened here. Nathan Thrall, who was the lead international crisis
*  group analyst on the region, he wrote a book a some number of years ago called The Only Language
*  You Understand, arguing that both Israelis and Palestinians tend to make their concessions under
*  the threat of force. You've done interviews and work around moments when fighting erupts between
*  Hamas and Israel and the sense that Hamas actually often does get concessions in those moments.
*  Hamas got a lot out of a prisoner exchange not too long ago under Netanyahu, and many people think
*  that was part of their incentive to take many more civilian hostages this time, and of course,
*  military hostages in the hopes of winning a lot of people back in another prisoner exchange.
*  How much do you think that Hamas thought this would actually get it concessions versus how much
*  do you think it understood that it was going to bring down a hellacious war? To be honest,
*  it's really hard to say, and I've been talking with a lot of people of exactly what Hamas thought
*  it was going to get out of this. And there are two elements to this operation as well. One side of it
*  is the military nature of it, of breaking out of the fence, of attacking military targets. This was
*  the first phase of what happened on October 7th in the morning hours of that. And this is what
*  Palestinians have been mostly looking to, that the group had the capacity to actually break out of
*  this cage and that they could actually completely humiliate the Israeli military, that it wasn't as
*  invincible as everyone was making it out to be, and that there was a way to shatter out of it.
*  But then that second side of that, of course, are these horrific massacres that happened in
*  the southern communities. I can't speak to how much they were directed. I can't speak to how much
*  not just in the question of a fog of war, but also the rage of war that these militants also
*  launched, some of the massacres that they did like that. We'll only get to know this in the coming
*  weeks, months, and years, as we investigate this more. But it's just unclear entirely what it was.
*  Were they just trying to play a certain card, just to say, just change something,
*  just change anything out of the equilibrium? Did they have a more concerted plan in coordination
*  with groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, hoping that that would serve enough deterrence? There's no way
*  Hamas did this, thinking that the Israelis were not going to respond so viciously. And we're not
*  sure how much they thought they could get away with a military assault in the first place. And
*  so there's just so much uncertainty, and we're still in that fog as we speak. So I really can't
*  speak to it. And even now, we're hearing different conflicting things sometimes from members of the
*  Hamas movement, from the political bureau, from the armed wing, from the people in Gaza versus
*  people outside. So it's been very messy to see all this. But in many respects, putting aside all these
*  questions, there's no doubt that I think Hamas, for the better and the worse, has really thrown
*  everyone in the region back onto the Palestinian question. At a time where it was really being
*  marginalized, Hamas has very violently forced all the Arab states to rethink their alliances
*  with Israel and to realize that the Palestinians still have political cards to play, even when
*  done in such a brutal fashion. And it's very complex to kind of navigate their full calculations
*  about this. But I think even just the very idea to show the Israelis that you can no longer go on
*  like this, I think for Hamas was also like an important message to send.
*  Yeah, I have really struggled with whether or not I even want to talk about this question, but
*  I feel very uncomfortable. And in some ways, as somebody who covered more in this region 15
*  years ago, 10 years ago than I do now, somewhat personally ashamed by something that you just
*  gestured at, which is that there were big efforts to draw attention to the conditions
*  that Palestinians were living under, the March of Return, various things in the divestment movement.
*  There have been other efforts. You know, Hamas has given big speeches at the UN.
*  And the savagery of Hamas's attacks seems to have worked in the sense of focusing a lot more
*  attention on the lived experience of Palestinians. And I think that needs to make a lot of us who
*  care about this conflict wonder about our own behavior over the past 10, 15 years. I don't
*  think that it absolves or justifies or excuses anything Hamas did, which is why this is difficult
*  to talk about. But I think that it casts a much more negative light on things that we weren't doing
*  before. Yeah. And this is really an absolutely vital question. And just putting aside even just
*  the question of the immoralities that we've been seeing, you know, not just by Hamas, but also what
*  is being inflicted now in Gaza by the Israeli state and the army. I mean, this comes back to
*  what I was saying earlier whereby Palestinians have tried everything. Really, they've picked up
*  their guns, they've picked up their pens, they've picked up their banners, everything you can think
*  of Palestinians have tried. And it's not an exaggeration to say how much Palestinians have
*  feel that they've been duped by the lessons of history, the international community, which
*  even governments that claim to support their rights and claim to be, you know, on their side
*  in some form or another. And what they're experiencing is that it doesn't matter what
*  they do, the very fact that they're Palestinian, the very fact that they are the biggest thorn
*  in a state that is desperately trying to make itself out as a quote unquote Jewish and democratic
*  state is in reality not interested in their existence, whether it's in physical presence,
*  not in their identity. And that their very existence as Palestinian Arabs is itself a threat.
*  And when we look at foreign governments, but also the media and the public and
*  where they've also just demonized anything and everything that Palestinians do. And it's become
*  very clear that Jewish Israelis matter more in much of the Western world, especially. I think in
*  the global South, you know, there's a very different understanding of this, but Israel thrives off and
*  is very much propped up by political, military, economic arrangements by, you know, what still
*  remains one of the foremost global superpower and European states that have such a hold
*  to enable Israel to do this with such impunity. And so, yeah, I think these questions really need
*  to be asked by the world, you know, like how much has, especially like Western publics and
*  Western governments facilitated that, not just facilitated the apartheid on the ground, but the
*  apartheid in the mind, that how much do we actually put Jewish Israeli rights first before
*  Palestinians? How disposable are Palestinians compared to Jewish Israelis? I'm not saying just
*  to say flip it. It needs to be rectified to understand Palestinians as humans.
*  The cost of this attention is that Hamas has incurred an overwhelming Israeli reprisal,
*  and predictably so, against Gazans. And possibly we'll see what happens in the West Bank. It could
*  spread from there. Many, many, many people are dying. Many, many, many people are losing their
*  homes. What trends, what tendencies do you see in the way Hamas' attack is now seen by Palestinians
*  in the Gaza or in the West Bank? How do they understand what Hamas did?
*  I mean, it's also been hard to gauge, you know, that Palestinians in a way don't even have time
*  to reflect on it, especially in Gaza. They're focused on survival. There was no time to even
*  process what had happened October 7th before the bomb started falling. And even in the West Bank,
*  you're seeing a massive escalation in military settler violence. And so they're seeing the kind
*  of immediate aftermath of that. And even inside Israel, Palestinian citizens who make up a fifth
*  of the Israeli citizenry are also just in a total paralyzing fear from Jewish Israeli society,
*  from the police, from Israeli institutions. And the thing is, we've seen these trends before.
*  You know, even those who maybe disagreed with Hamas or even found the massacres to be kind of
*  morally abhorrent, they still understand why Hamas is still keeping to military struggle. And that
*  even if they disagree with it, they understand the context behind it. And this is a big difference
*  between, you don't have to defend it, but you need to understand why it's the case. You need to
*  understand why political violence, even murderous violence is used in such a context. I know this is
*  a very delicate subject and many people might be like immediately outraged by it, but it can't be
*  that the way we spent trying to understand the logic or even just the ideas behind such political
*  violence in other contexts, somehow all of that is raised when it comes to the Palestinians.
*  And so in the community, I think if there's ever a space, there's going to be huge debates. And
*  there are debates, whether it's in private living rooms or whether it's in forums. Even
*  Palestinian citizens of Israel have a bit more ability to even debate this, about the question
*  again of armed struggle and what's been going on now. But everyone is in such survival mode,
*  because the state and society has really turned on them, that it's been hard to really gauge what
*  everyone's reflecting on this. But what we do know is just the fact that everyone could expect such
*  wanton violence from the Israeli state, especially in regards to Gaza, the fact that everyone could
*  predict that there was Israeli settler and state violence in huge parts of the occupied West Bank,
*  that still needs to be part of the conversation. You were talking about a piece of violence that
*  happened on October 7th. What about the daily violence that happened before? What about the
*  daily violence that happened afterwards? And if that's still being ignored, then for Palestinians,
*  it's that sense that we're on our own, that at least someone is exposing to people that the
*  violence is there, whether or not you're actually attentive to it. The violence is there even when
*  Jewish Israelis are not being killed or massacred. So this for Palestinians is still that dominant
*  thought. There's a tendency when you want to talk about how this could be better to move to the
*  question of state-based frameworks, two states, one state's big picture of settlements. You've
*  been pretty critical of the tendency to talk about this in terms of state-based solutions.
*  Tell me why. I think one of the biggest lessons I take from the height of the decolonization era
*  of the past century is how much the state, first of all, it entraps political struggles
*  in many respects, or how much of a fake identity it is in many respects, that it really limits
*  and disrupts our understanding of history, of how societies live and exist and can organize
*  themselves outside of these very arbitrary borders. And they are, in the end, arbitrary.
*  Even historical Palestine was once integrated into the region. And yes, you had the idea of
*  provinces and you had different kinds of regional identities. There was a much more fluid construct
*  of identity that existed. But then I think also the part of the era of the anti-colonial period
*  was that for them, nationalism became the engine for your liberation. And that itself is still very
*  exclusionary. The idea that you need to have these very rigid borders is still very exclusionary.
*  And I think we can be better than that. And it's a bit of a tragedy that Palestine is still one of
*  those kind of, it's a struggle that's very much out of its place. It's like 19th century ideologies
*  and the 20th century conflict in the 21st century world. And even though we're seeing these kind of
*  resurgences of nationalisms and state borders and all these aspects, there are ways to imagine
*  something differently. And I worry that the Palestinian struggle and Palestinianness and
*  Palestinian identity has been so wrapped in Arab nationalism that I think we can look back to our
*  own history and our own literature to remind ourselves that there's something broader.
*  What are local identities? In Palestine, whether you're from Nablus or from Gaza or from Haifa,
*  the local identities were a huge part of our daily existence. And so there's something about
*  state to the nationalism, which kind of erases that a lot of times. And people know this in
*  America. People know this all over the world. It misguides us by just asserting ourselves in that
*  kind of national state identity. And this for me is also the case in Israel-Palestin. And Zionism,
*  in that respect, political Zionism, is also for me that kind of archaic idea whereby they can only
*  envision Jewish safety with this hyper-militarized, powerful state, and that it needs to be
*  exclusionary and that Palestine needs to be only for one people, for the Jewish people.
*  And that itself is ethnocentric. That itself is what facilitates apartheid. And so I don't think
*  the answer to imagining something outside of Zionism that's manifested today needs to be
*  another kind of nationalism. It could be a state that could be broken down more. What is Jewish
*  existence outside of the state of Israel? Outside in terms of in the land, but away from those
*  constructs. And to reorganize ourselves and rethink our identities in different ways. So how do you
*  reflect the people on the ground? Like Israeli society itself, Jewish Israelis will tell you
*  first and foremost that they can hardly sometimes find the things that really unite them. Jewish
*  Israeli society is just as diverse as any other. Life in Tel Aviv is nothing like life in Jerusalem,
*  or life in the South or in the North. And the same way that for Palestinians as well, it's a massive
*  diversity. So how do you reflect that diversity by actually reflecting the people on the ground
*  and not some political idea to try to pretend that we're on the same page in this one single
*  territory that needs to be cut off from everybody else? How do we envision a more decentralized
*  model of existence? How do we think about regions? How do we think about cities as leading
*  our political and economic ways of life? I'm only sort of vaguely scratching these services. And
*  there are people who have done a lot of amazing work on this. But I just don't want us to be
*  trapped by these ideas, which we can see in every part of the world. It ended up becoming
*  its own oppressive system on its own people. So I want us to break out of that. But if the answer
*  to that is not only that we get attacked for doing so, we're even called anti-Semites because
*  we're actually envisioning something that's not a Jewish state, but especially in the Western world,
*  where if I say I want a state for all its citizens, or I want a land for all its inhabitants,
*  and the response is that you're asking for the destruction of the Jewish people,
*  I don't have the space to even imagine that. And I'm being demonized for doing so. So I think
*  trying to provide the legitimate spaces for Palestinians to think about that and to say why
*  Zionism is a problem, and to say that we can imagine something outside of nationalism and
*  statehood, I think is much more realistic to who we are, much more realistic to
*  the future that we want and to create something much better.
*  I want to go back to the question of equilibrium because I found that idea holding in my own mind
*  recently. And I think the reason it has attained a certain power for me is that what I'm seeing
*  in the media coverage of what's happening in Israel and in Gaza right now, what I'm seeing
*  in my own community, in my own life, is the tendency to think in terms of sides when everything is
*  actually in equilibrium. I'll give an example that's maybe a little bit personal. I'm Jewish.
*  My natural identification is with Israel. A lot of the people around me are that way too.
*  But the thing that I see happening is that as people experience more anti-Semitism on the left
*  or they see it on social media, it pushes them to a more closed off, scared, and in some ways brutal
*  space. The more scared people get, the more they're willing to countenance in order to restore
*  security. The idea that there's a static choice, where they were a month ago is not where they are
*  now. They have changed. The equilibrium has shifted. So you have to think in terms of the
*  ways in which what one side is doing changes the other. And to me, what's true here, or what seems
*  true, is that the thing that is the dominant value on the Israeli side is security. And the dominant
*  demand on the Palestinian side is freedom. Now, it's not the only demand of either side, but one
*  of the big questions for me in how to think about this as an equilibrium, but about how to think
*  about a better equilibrium, is how do you get more security and more freedom, as opposed to
*  seeing those two things as zero sum, which is I think how they're often seen, where more freedom
*  for Palestinians would mean less security for Israelis because Hamas could plan more attacks,
*  more security for Israelis would mean less freedom for Palestinians because Israel would clamp down
*  on control and surveillance and drones. How do you find more positive sum equilibriums,
*  as opposed to thinking about this in terms of which side do you end up on? Because there's
*  not going to be just one side at the end of it all. You have to find some kind of dynamic balance.
*  That's a tough question. It starts by recognizing that what you describe as the equilibrium
*  on the larger scale for the better part of the past century has existed and been legitimated
*  on a sort of asymmetric plane. So the equilibrium that we've been known since Zionism came about
*  is that Zionism got the better part of the equilibrium, where there was great power backing
*  and being able to fulfill that vision and even being able to use violence and even international
*  support to legitimate that vision at the expense of Palestinians. And even as we were talking about
*  the idea that the two-state solution is somehow the equilibrium for how to resolve this conflict,
*  it's not. The two-state solution, as we envision it in the past 30 years especially, is telling
*  Palestinians to accept maybe about a quarter or a fifth of their homeland as their state, not their
*  belonging and their connections, their identity to the wider region. And for Israelis, yes,
*  the idea of security and freedom must come through a powerful state. And not just through a powerful
*  state, it requires ethnoracial supremacy. The tragedy of the Palestinian struggle is that
*  there were a lot of debates and visions to put something different from the ethnocentric
*  model of the future. Our struggle itself also began to think that the equilibrium point is
*  through that. And this is why the PLO acquiesced to the two-state solution, acquiesced to Oslo.
*  But I think this young generation of Palestinians are saying they're not interested in having just
*  a state with a capital to play the same international game like everyone else. The
*  conversation for them is, am I getting my equal rights? Am I getting the right to return to my
*  homeland? Am I able to live in my land without another society determining how many rights I
*  get to have? As much as we want to try also think about this, how do we lead this in a positive
*  way, it also requires sort of negative force in a way that we need to bring the Israeli parameters
*  down and to elevate the Palestinian parameters up in order to create a different kind of equilibrium.
*  That's the power asymmetry that needs to be dealt with. And I know we're kind of speaking
*  in a bit of sort of kind of meta and conceptual, but this really manifests in everything. As long
*  as that power asymmetry is still in place, you won't get a meaningful equilibrium and Palestinians
*  will always be worse off on it. And so I think this is why Palestinians are so strident about it,
*  whereby lip service to equality, to human rights, international law, to the self-determination of
*  people, to even refugees being allowed to return, that somehow Palestinians are being asked to
*  waive all that because Jews need their own state with laws and policies that enable
*  Jewish privilege above everybody else. That's the equity that needs to be shifted. It needs to be
*  redrawn entirely. And I think American Jews and Jews in diaspora and people abroad have a huge role
*  to play in this and to not only tell Israelis why an apartheid regime is not the guarantee of your
*  survival and also to enable Palestinians to say that a vision of real equality and full restoration
*  of everyone's rights and belonging to the land is what is supported. Well, I'm an American Jew and
*  a Jew of the diaspora. And the thing that I see when I have this conversation with Israeli friends
*  or sources or people in Israel, the thing that I'm asked and that I don't honestly have a good
*  answer to is that all sounds nice. That all would be great. But that isn't what Palestinians want.
*  They want us gone. And at times when our politics have been softer and the peaceniks stronger and
*  labor stronger, and maybe it wasn't perfect and obviously there are claims and counterclaims about
*  every single negotiation that has happened, but there were suicide bombings in cafes and discotheques
*  and there is no safety for us in equality. That equality can only take place in a context of safety.
*  But when Hamas is a strong force, when there are polls that say armed resistance is the
*  preferred path forward, that there's no way to move towards that because we will die. And I mean,
*  the fear of annihilation, the fear of eradication lurks deep in the Jewish soul and that's not going
*  away and for real reason. And so I'm curious what, not that this is on you to answer, but I'm curious
*  what you would tell me to answer, right? When they say that all sounds nice, but the first thing we
*  need to be able to guarantee is that our children aren't killed. What inequality in a movement
*  towards equality given stated positions and given factions that we really do see allows for that to
*  be also something that makes Jewish Israelis safer, not less safe.
*  As much as myself and my people kind of come at the cost of this, I understand why Jewish Israelis
*  have, the way that Zionism has manifested itself, I understand why that's come about,
*  just psychologically speaking. But if that's the case, then it begins with being a little bit
*  honest exactly about what the political project is in Israel. That if the lesson of Jewish history,
*  of antisemitism, very violent antisemitism all the way up to the Holocaust, if the lesson of that,
*  and this is what Zionism kind of began to take hold especially, that the lesson is to become
*  powerful overlords, then we need to be a bit blunt about that. Beginning with that,
*  Israel actually is not a democratic state. Israel is not a light onto the nations. Israel is an
*  ethno-nationalist colonial project who can only see survival by being an ethno-nationalist colonial
*  project. And if that's their decision, that's their decision. But one of the most infuriating
*  things that everyone's pretending that Israel is something that it's not. And what's been
*  darkly refreshing about this far-right government is that they've also been very unapologetic,
*  saying, we don't need to apologize. We do want laws and policies that weed out Palestinians. We
*  do want laws and policies that kick them out of their land. We do want a purely Jewish supremacist
*  state, regardless of democracy or vote. The democracy does not matter. And this has been
*  the practice. This has been the experience of Palestinians. If that's the case, then I think
*  like for American Jews, they need to come face to face with that reality and stop kidding themselves
*  that Israel is that democratic model of Jewish self-determination. It's an apartheid model.
*  And American Jews, they need to ask themselves, are those really where their values align?
*  They talk about equality in the United States, but ethno-nationalism in Israel-Palestine, is that
*  consistent with your values? But if American Jews can't square that circle, then they need to ask
*  exactly, like, well, yes, sometimes there is a side. It's not about being with the Palestinians
*  versus Israelis. It's about, am I on the side of genuine equality for everyone, or am I on the
*  side of supremacy? But see, in a way, I think that was an easy question. And I'll use myself
*  as the example here. Over the last 10 years, Israel became something that many American Jews
*  could not support. And I think you see that in polling of younger American Jews. I mean,
*  the number who would say that what we were seeing in Israel's apartheid had gone to levels that
*  would have been unimaginable in the 90s. And for a lot of us, as Israeli society chose people like
*  Ben Gavir, as the Netanyahu government moved further and further right, a lot of us disengaged.
*  I mean, it wasn't a society listening to us. Being Jewish gives me no traction on Israeli politics.
*  And so to say that I don't support this project, I don't support what this has become,
*  I mean, that in a way was easy. I don't want to in any way be trying to draw
*  some kind of hopeful picture in the sky here, because I don't feel hopeful. I do think,
*  though, that there is at least some chance that the failure of that far right project,
*  the failure of Israel completely embracing unoppressive ethnonationalism, to even provide
*  the one thing that it promised, which was security, possibly reopens the door to something else.
*  Now, that thing could be worse. That thing could be no different, right? Again, I don't come to
*  politics with a teleological belief that it bends towards justice. Certainly, it'll come to this
*  conflict with that. But I think the question within the question of re-engagement that a lot of us are
*  trying to struggle and understand is that you do need to be able to speak of security, right?
*  Equality needs to come alongside security, not as a deal. Again, this is why I've become interested
*  in the language of equilibrium as something that emerges organically from shifting factions,
*  shifting power, shifting ways people relate to each other, different leaders, right? I mean,
*  it has happened in other conflicts in societies. I mean, things end and things change. And so,
*  I think a lot of what you're saying, you know, certainly prior to 10-7 was right. And I think,
*  again, the kind of shame that I alluded to earlier is that for a lot of us, the decision was to just
*  kind of stop paying attention to it because I don't live in Israel and I don't support what Israel
*  has been doing and I don't support what their government has become. And I don't have to live
*  under it. If that is not sustainable, and I think a lot of us have had the experience that, you know,
*  there is a deep tie here. And so, tragedy and trauma, both in Israel and in Gaza and in Palestine,
*  watching this become everybody's horror forces a kind of re-engagement. And I don't have an
*  answer on this. I am genuinely struggling with it, right? I open the inbox of the show all the time
*  and I get flooded by Israeli emails saying, yeah, look, this is all nice, but we need to be safe and
*  you have no answer for that. And so, that I think is a thing that I'm struggling to even explore on
*  the show, which is, forget a deal. Are there factions, are there possibilities that begin
*  to move towards positive some? I mean, it seems to me that it should be possible that equality
*  should bring security. That's been true in many other places. It doesn't seem impossible here,
*  but I don't know how to convince anyone of that. And of course, it's all easy to say from a podcast
*  studio in New York. I mean, I can give a real example to show that there's a different model
*  that's being practiced as we speak. And it's a model that's very imperfect for a host of reasons.
*  And that is the experience of Palestinian citizens of Israel or Arab citizens of Israel,
*  who, like I said, make up 20% of the citizenry. I'm one of them. So, I mean, for people maybe
*  who are not so familiar, you know, basically after the Nakbe of 48, you still had about 150,000
*  Palestinians on the Israeli side of the border out of the armistice lines. And the state, for
*  kind of a host of complex reasons, gave them Israeli citizenship. And we've had the right to
*  vote since 1948, 1950. And in theory, you know, we're supposed to be given equal rights. But in
*  reality, since day one, there's a massive legal, political policy infrastructure that makes us
*  second class citizens, you know, to put it nicely. And that discrimination, that inequality is not
*  just something about historical gaps. It's an active constant, especially even in the past couple
*  of years. I mean, there's a lot to unpack on this, but this community identifies itself as
*  Palestinian Arab that was able to stay in their historical homeland, even as their historical
*  homeland was completely usurped and transformed. But this community knows Hebrew. They've been
*  exposed to Jewish society as a civilian society, differently from Palestinians in the occupied
*  territories, mostly see Israelis as settlers and soldiers upfront. We're exposed to their language,
*  their culture, to their religion, to their ideas. And despite our inequality, and despite
*  the discrimination, and despite the demonization, and despite being described as demographic threats
*  and enemies and what have you, and even in our second class status, we can still understand
*  Jewish society and come to different kinds of arrangements and terms, whereby we're even
*  working in the same socioeconomic centers, Palestinian citizens vote in the same parliament,
*  there are models and methods to this. We're a community that really defies the green line,
*  even before Gaza was under blockade, Palestinian citizens, to this day, we still have family and
*  national connections to people in Gaza, in the West Bank, even refugees in exile. The West Bank
*  is part and parcel of daily life of Palestinian citizens. The border does not operate on us,
*  and doesn't operate on anyone with an Israeli license plate or a blue ID card, but we're
*  actually showing that there's a life that actually can go between the river and the sea, that can
*  actually be inside the homeland and to go about politics and the way of life, which isn't just
*  this demonized idea that, oh, the Palestinians are going to come to kill us. And that, I think,
*  is a very useful model in the community that for all its flaws and imperfections and all the
*  internal issues, and it's still operating in a state that still wants to see them gone for the
*  most part, but that we still have the space to provide something different. I should also just
*  add that Palestinian citizens have a lot of diversity, even politically, from your secular
*  to your Islamists, and from your nationalists to your communists and what have you, but the
*  underlying core of all their political ideas is centered around what they describe as national
*  equality or a state for all its citizens. But that experience, again, it's almost like a leading model
*  for what the Palestinian struggle could be and what a real future vision can be, but it's also
*  evidence that for most Jewish Israelis, they cannot accept that. They see the idea of full
*  equality as a threat to the Jewish state. And it's not just something about in theory, like in
*  practice, from the Knesset all the way down, when Palestinian citizens even try to practice that,
*  let alone even propose it as a political idea, it's roundly rejected. And even in spite of
*  everything, Palestinian citizens, even now, after October 7th, their leaders and the public are
*  still coming out to say that there's a different way around this. But here again, and with its
*  American Jews or even Jewish Israelis, if they can't even tolerate the idea that we need to
*  break down the quote unquote Jewish state in order to create a state for all its citizens,
*  a place of real equality, then it's on others to meet us and to meet our equilibrium point.
*  But in search of any kind of optimistic sort of light, I think that community is an important
*  place to start. I think I'll leave it there. Always our final question. What are three books
*  you would recommend to the audience? One that has been very much on my mind since I read it was
*  actually East West Street by Philip Sands. It's an amazing book, which I read a couple of years ago,
*  and is really just stuck in my mind day in, day out, and even more so over these past weeks.
*  For those who haven't read it, it beautifully traces both the personal family history and also
*  the history of like, you know, of antisemitism and the Jewish experience in Europe and how people
*  thought about these things. But basically, I was also enwrapped with two of the kind of
*  architects of the idea of genocide, Raphael Lemkin and Hirsch Lauterpacht. That genocide
*  is also about the idea of erasing the essence of a community, you know, of destroying them even in
*  part and that death is a means for something almost more nefarious. And it's been ringing in
*  my head a lot because of even if people think that somehow extreme, what we're seeing in Gaza
*  just kept bringing me back to that and how even a lot of the psychologists that played in with the
*  characters of this book, how it still resonates even for me and how it resonates for Palestinians
*  and that even the people who seem like this is kind of like unacceptable to even begin to compare,
*  I urge you to read or reread that book. And for those who haven't read it, I mean, I would always
*  recommend Orientalism by Edward Said, which is so formative for me, but really helps you to also
*  understand even some of the premises of why Palestinians in the Arab world, how they understand
*  the way that the West has looked at them in the structures of power and how ideas can manifest
*  themselves and just the history of colonialism and how that still operates to this day. And the third
*  book is The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin, anything by Baldwin to be honest, the way that he
*  just captures the experience of racism just resonates so much for Palestinians and just his
*  command of the language is just so gripping and the ferocity with which every line that he writes
*  just carries. I'm really not kidding when I say Palestinians have really looked to him in many
*  respects of just like being able to articulate that. And I would highly recommend reading him
*  at this moment to understand what it means to be a community that's so heavily discriminated
*  and marginalized. Even though it's different contexts, Palestinians can see all that Baldwin
*  wrote kind of word for word and feel what he wrote word for word. So yeah, those would be my three.
*  Yeah.
