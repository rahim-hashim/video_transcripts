# A $1.7 Million Toilet and Liberalism's Failure to Build
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4wvMZErzMs)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So the book I'm writing is about why it's become so hard for Democrats to build in the
*  places where they govern.
*  It's not that they don't want to build.
*  Democrats have passed no end of laws putting money towards clean energy and affordable
*  housing and mass transit and much, much more.
*  But when you look into what has happened after those laws passed, the outcomes don't always
*  match intentions.
*  Let's put it that way.
*  But not that many people do look at what happens after those laws pass.
*  And honestly, I found it kind of radicalizing to follow a bunch of these through to their
*  completion or their non-completion.
*  Being pretty wonkish liberals, of which I am one and have been one, we sometimes seem
*  to me like we love weddings, but we don't have the patience for marriage.
*  Implementation matters.
*  What happens after the bill passes matters.
*  And across a lot of domains of policy, implementation is not going that well in the places where
*  Democrats govern and it is creating or worsening real public policy crises.
*  I'm not the only person who's been obsessing about these issues.
*  Trudy Slim-Dempses is a staff writer at the Atlantic, now a rare three-time guest on the
*  show.
*  She and I are always in some kind of running conversation on these themes, but I'm in a
*  sticky part of the book writing process right now.
*  And so I wanted to have her back on the show to do some of this thinking together in public.
*  As always, my email for feedback, thoughts, guest suggestions, Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
*  Trudy Slim-Dempses, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  I've been thinking about this piece you wrote a while back about this fight to build more
*  housing on an old golf course in Denver, Colorado.
*  And the way that what came next complicates this question of what we mean when we talk
*  about the government or who we mean when we talk about the people or what they believe.
*  So can you walk me through what happened there?
*  So there's a golf course in this neighborhood in Denver called Park Hill.
*  And in 1997, Denver paid the owners of the golf course $2 million to put a conservation
*  easement on the property, which means that it would limit what you could actually do
*  with it.
*  And then decades later, a development company bought the defunct golf course for $24 million
*  and wanted to redevelop it into housing and some commercial space as well.
*  And there is a very contentious battle of whether or not to actually redevelop this
*  into more housing.
*  And the measure loses by like a significant margin.
*  I think it's like nearly 20 points.
*  But it's weird because those same voters, almost a quarter million Denver voters, supported
*  Jared Polis in the 2022 election.
*  And Jared Polis has made increasing housing supply a core part of his campaign strategy.
*  And then that year also, 1.3 million Coloradans voted to dedicate hundreds of millions of
*  dollars to increasing affordable housing in Denver proper.
*  So I say all that because the same people are ostensibly voting at different levels
*  of government for things that seem contradictory.
*  But I think the real thing that's going on here is that people, when they're asked
*  questions at different levels of government, they respond with different parts of
*  themselves. When you're asked, hi, would you like to solve this problem of a housing
*  crisis? I recognize that you're upset about this.
*  We need to have a solution.
*  I'm a governor who's going to attract this solution with pragmatism.
*  They say, yes, I like this.
*  I want you as my representative in order to solve this problem.
*  I don't want to get into the minutiae because I'm not a city planner or whatever.
*  I want you to solve it.
*  Versus when they look at the local level, the only thing they're asked is yes or no,
*  should you develop this?
*  Right. They're not asked, do you want to solve the housing crisis?
*  They're asked like all things equal because what is a few thousand homes really going
*  to do for the housing crisis?
*  Not very much.
*  You know, would you want this to change?
*  And they're like, you know, all things equal.
*  I like to say the same because you're asking them a different question.
*  How do we define the people really depends on the venue in which we're meeting them.
*  Right. Because if you think about yourself, too, like it depends what you're being asked,
*  what you're willing to give up.
*  There is a principle believed by many people, sometimes believed by me, that the government
*  that is nearest to the people is the best level of government at which to act.
*  Because that is where you get the closest match between representation and democracy.
*  A lot of your work has begun to pick at this question of localism and pick at this question
*  of whether or not that is actually true or at least what is lost when we act that way.
*  So talk a bit about that dimension of it.
*  Fundamentally, I think the problem with local government is that the reason why people feel
*  generally OK with it is because they have no idea what's going on and they're not actually
*  engaged in the conflict and the very contentious decisions that are happening all the time
*  in their local government. You're frustrated with your national government because you're kind of
*  tuned in. Like you're aware that there are very consequential questions going on about
*  abortion, about immigration, about climate, and you see it, you hear about it, you're engaged in
*  it, and you're frustrated when things don't turn out your way.
*  It is a part of the democratic discourse in a way that is not true for lower levels of
*  government. So as you get lower down and as you get more decentralized, you get less and less
*  attention, right? The local government's doing some of the most important influential decision
*  making when it comes to people's quality of life, and they're not actually being held
*  accountable for it. So local governments are fundamentally responsible for how land is used
*  in this country. They get a lot of permitting authority for whether or not new houses can come up,
*  what kinds of houses can come up. They get permitting authority about what kinds of energy can come up,
*  energy infrastructure can be used for, what kinds of transit can be used for.
*  I mean, anything you can imagine that can be done with land is decided basically at the local level.
*  And so the problem I have is that we see repeatedly that very few people
*  actually vote for local government.
*  There is a survey called Who Votes for Mayor done by Portland State University, and it looks at
*  23 million voting records in local elections across 50 cities.
*  And they find that in 10 of America's largest cities, turnout doesn't exceed 15 percent.
*  In Las Vegas, Fort Worth and Dallas, turnout was in the single digits.
*  And then we have other findings that indicate that the older you are, the much more likely you are to
*  vote. And the people who decide to be a part of local government are also themselves
*  self-selecting as people who are already more likely to be involved in government, which means
*  they're more likely to be wealthy, they're more likely to be politically connected, they're more
*  likely to be a homeowner. And all of these things really bias the system.
*  I remember asking a hyperlocal elected official in a poor area in D.C.
*  about bike lanes. And they told me that, well, nobody bikes in my area.
*  Like, people just have to drive. It's just ridiculous.
*  But in their area, there was 20 percent of people who did not even own a car.
*  So when I think about your question about, like, why is there this, like, kind of through-line
*  critique of localism in my work, it's because I don't really buy the contention that these
*  individuals are more likely to know what their local community looks like on
*  the questions that are actually relevant for politics.
*  And the way that we have that in democracy is through voting.
*  And if you don't have people voting for you, I don't think you have to actually be attuned to their
*  interests.
*  Let me talk a bit about a story that I've been tracking for my book, because I think it
*  gets at a lot of these dynamics.
*  There is quite famously, there's been San Francisco Chronicle coverage of it, New York Times
*  coverage of it. In San Francisco, there's a part of the city called Noe Valley.
*  Noe is lovely.
*  It is very rich.
*  It has a wonderful farmers market.
*  At that wonderful farmers market, there's like a little park where you can take your kids and they
*  can play on this tiny slide while you're getting your extremely expensive produce.
*  And in this park-ish area, this little kind of square, there is plumbing for a toilet.
*  And for a long time, the community has wanted a nice public restroom there.
*  Eventually, the state representative representing that community was able to get the money for that
*  public restroom. And he got one point seven million dollars.
*  Sorry. Sorry.
*  It's a very funny story on some level, but very grim.
*  He got one point seven million dollars from the state.
*  Then people noticed that this toilet was going to cost one point seven million dollars.
*  And they got really mad and it got a bunch of press coverage.
*  And the celebration became a scandal.
*  And the state came in and said, we're going to claw back this money.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  So then people begin digging into the story.
*  Like, what's going on here?
*  The representative who gets the money says, look, I know this is ridiculous.
*  I know this costs too much money, but this is how much I'm told a toilet costs.
*  And so I got to get you the money.
*  Nobody wants me to get them the money for half of a public restroom.
*  So this is a question of, well, why does installing a public restroom cost so much
*  money right here?
*  And you begin to get the sort of answer on spools, which I would call not an explanation,
*  but a description of process.
*  And construction costs are very high in San Francisco and you got to pay through the
*  city, you know, higher wage.
*  And there are like seven or eight or nine different agencies that need to sign off on
*  this. And, you know, it has to go through a design review and the normal way we would
*  do it is have a sort of design come out and then we have to do a feedback meeting with
*  a local community to make sure they like the design.
*  And there are just a million things that pile on.
*  And at every point of this pile on, there are public employee salaries that are coming
*  into the cost of this.
*  And the Rec and Park agent who ends up being quoted on this in the media, he's like,
*  look, you know, this is just our process.
*  But nobody likes the process.
*  Everybody's mad about it.
*  The members of government are mad about it.
*  And he's mad about it, too.
*  Like he's saying in the paper, listen, if you wanted to be cheaper, you can pass some
*  bills to make this cheaper for me.
*  You can pass some laws.
*  You can exempt putting a toilet in from environmental review, which again is just extremely
*  funny on some level.
*  So then you get this sort of war of words back and forth.
*  And the guy notes, look, this isn't even unusual.
*  We installed toilets that cost about this much in neighboring parts of the city and
*  nobody cared. It's really just the press getting involved here that has made everybody
*  so mad. I tell the story in part because I think it gets
*  a dynamic that I keep running into in my reporting, which is that when you follow
*  the line of trying to build things in certainly in blue areas, which is where I'm
*  focusing, when you follow it down the line, you end up seeing a process that doesn't
*  seem to make anybody happy.
*  And yet at no point did this end with them reforming the process.
*  Yeah. And most of the time, and this was the point of the Rec and Park director,
*  nobody even knows about the process.
*  And they don't want to be experts on local procurement and contracting processes.
*  And, you know, probably if you asked them, do you want there to be a rule in the
*  city that the city has to have a public notice when it's going to do a development?
*  They would say yes. And on the other hand, they don't want things to cost as much and
*  take this long. I've come to think of this as a sort of liberalism of the details
*  where people, they pass the bill.
*  But then if you follow what's happening after the bill passes into the details of the
*  governance, it looks completely nuts.
*  But on the other hand, nobody's really well incentivized to reform the way government
*  works. It's a lot of fighting with your own government and fighting with your allies.
*  They would need some kind of mass public outcry that would get them to focus on the
*  structure of government itself. And they don't have that either.
*  And to me, this is actually responsible for a lot of liberalism's current problems and
*  pathologies. If everybody was happy with what they were getting and I just didn't
*  like it, fine. But it is very strange to listen to Gavin Newsom and London Breed and
*  these other people condemn their own government, but also not have any real traction
*  on how to change it.
*  Yeah, I think that the problem here, right, is that and the reason why this has been so
*  prevalent in blue areas, as you said, is because the coalition Democratic Party has
*  so many individual groups with varying concerns, none of which constitute a majority.
*  So you have people who are really focused on the environment, people who are really
*  focused on immigration, people who are really focused on labor, people who are really
*  focused on women's rights. I mean, the list goes on.
*  And these are often like very laudable groups who are fighting for the interests of the
*  people in the public they want to represent.
*  But when their interests end up trading off against one another, there isn't really
*  someone who can just mediate and say, we don't want a one point seven million dollar
*  toilet. And in order not to have one point seven million dollar toilet, we need to
*  relax environmental review in this way.
*  And that's just something you have to sit with environmental groups.
*  The mental groups won't stand for that. They're very afraid, rightfully so often in
*  many cases that if you do something like that, like maybe that means a slippery slope
*  towards allowing other things that are environmentally harmful.
*  And so they fight very strongly for their own interests in order to maintain that.
*  Or you have another situation, right, where I think this comes into play again, the
*  plethora of government agencies and levels of government that are involved in these
*  decisions. Right. Every single level of government is very afraid and jealous of its
*  own power being taken away.
*  They're worried that, OK, if we lose control over this now, what if there's a future
*  situation, maybe not about this toilet, but about something else where we will need
*  this veto power. Right.
*  And of course, every individual feels like, well, my office is pretty efficient.
*  It's the other guys that are the problem. Right.
*  So you have this endemic issue then, right, where they have so many points in the
*  process where you have the opportunity to delay and pause and no points the process
*  where everyone's trying to rev up, even though every individual in this could be, you
*  know, the most publicly minded, most publicly oriented person who's trying to do the
*  right thing. There's no way to go through dozens of agencies to require detailed
*  review to create all of these processes for public input without taking up the kind
*  of time that would then run up the cost of any project.
*  And so I think that that is a real problem for blue areas because regulations are
*  costly and they can be costly for good things.
*  There are a lot of regulations that have saved so many countless lives.
*  But if we can't actually do an accounting of which ones are worth the cost for
*  individual types of projects, if we can't do an accounting of which ones we need to
*  keep, then you're going to end up with everything costing so much money, with
*  everything taking so much time and you lose out on a lot of the equity gains you're
*  trying to get by maintaining this power.
*  One of the interesting things happening in the implementation of the inflation
*  reduction act is you're seeing more of the money for decarbonization infrastructure
*  go to red states.
*  You're seeing in particular a lot of it go to Georgia and Texas.
*  And Texas has a very anti-renewable streak in it right now.
*  There are a lot of bills and things that are going to be used to get the money
*  to make it harder to build renewable energy in the state.
*  And at the same time, because it is so damn easy to build things in Texas, more
*  renewable infrastructure is being built there.
*  Defaults are really important.
*  And so, you know, in a lot of my work around the sort of liberalism that builds set of
*  issues, I've come to understand like the basic issue is like the problem in the
*  blue states is the default is set to make things so much more difficult.
*  And so, you know, I've come to understand like the basic issue is like the problem
*  in the blue states is the default is set to make things hard.
*  Even when the politics want to make it easy, it's a very strange way to watch
*  government playing out.
*  And I think it often offends a lot of our ideological intuitions.
*  But when you see it enough, you got to at some point be like, there's a real problem
*  here.
*  I think a good example of this is in Pennsylvania when there was the I-95
*  catastrophe last year and they had to stop traffic on one of the highest arterial
*  interstates in the country.
*  Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat in a purple state, he relaxed and paused a ton
*  of different types of regulations and said, we're going to streamline this
*  extremely quickly and we're going to get this built.
*  And it took 12 days to get I-95 back and operational.
*  And so I think this tells us something important.
*  It tells us a couple of things.
*  One is that when the person who is responsible for a salient catastrophe is
*  actually empowered to wade through the morass of regulations and different bodies
*  to get something done, they can.
*  That means we have the capacity to get something done when it's important to us.
*  This is most obviously happening in the housing space, right, where you have tons
*  and tons of regulations that have been behind the scenes for a really long time,
*  doing a lot of work to prevent the construction of much needed housing.
*  And people got really, really mad about that outcome.
*  They got really, really mad about high housing costs.
*  They got really, really mad about the fact that their kids can't live near them.
*  They got very angry about how homeownership was really out of grass.
*  They watched homelessness spike out of control in many of these urban areas.
*  And that pressure caused government to have to respond.
*  And it's caused them to have to respond in a way that is addressing in some places,
*  many of the very minutiae that we're talking about here.
*  In Montana, after COVID-19 caused a lot of people to move to the state, spiking home
*  prices, you had the Republican governor and Republican legislature address the
*  problem in Colorado, as I talked about Jared Polis is trying to do this in
*  California, where it has been multiple reforms.
*  And I think often unnoticed is in Washington state, which is a liberal state
*  where they Jay Inslee and a coalition of folks in legislature have worked very hard
*  to try to undo bit by bit these regulations that are stopping the construction of
*  affordable housing. I think, of course, it's notable that red states have been able to
*  take the largest steps the most quickly.
*  I think Montana is a really good example of that.
*  But at the same time, I do think that the problem is bigger in blue states.
*  There are more expensive cities.
*  There's been more people in these places for longer.
*  It's only now that we're seeing a lot of growth heading towards the southwest and
*  south in general, where you have these red states having to confront these problems
*  in a way that they haven't had to do for decades.
*  So I think there's a lot of correct criticism that I and other people level at
*  blue governments. But at the same time, I do think that even though Republicans have
*  had a sort of more lax approach towards permitting and towards regulation, they also
*  haven't had to deal with the problem.
*  I'm delighted you brought up I-95 in Pennsylvania because I've been doing a lot of
*  reporting on that for the book, actually.
*  And it's an interesting, I think, case for us to spend a couple of minutes on.
*  So I spent some time talking to Mike Carroll, who is the Secretary of Transportation
*  there, and just going through what actually happened and what they did.
*  And you mentioned that Governor Shapiro was able to relax and pause a bunch of rules.
*  What he's able to do was declare a state of emergency.
*  There had been a tanker with more than 8,000 gallons of fuel.
*  It overturned. It set on fire.
*  And then the bridge above it collapsed.
*  And in declaring that state of emergency, the normal procurement rules, the normal
*  contracting rules, the normal going out for comment rules, the normal ways you might
*  sue or have to do environmental review, all of that got swept away.
*  So Mike Carroll told me that he got the call that this had happened.
*  He makes his way to the bridge as fast as he can.
*  And not far from him are two contractors who are already doing work in that area.
*  And basically, by the day's end, he has chosen these two contractors to manage the
*  demolition and the rebuild.
*  And he can only do that because all this got waived.
*  I said, how long would that have normally taken you?
*  And he said to me that the normal way, and here I'm quoting him, so in a traditional
*  delivery of a project, it'd be months.
*  We'd hire a consultant to design it.
*  We need final design approved by the Federal Highway Administration.
*  Then there'd be bidding from interested contractors.
*  Then we'd process the bids.
*  Then we'd issue a contract.
*  So that would be 12 to 24 months.
*  And he said that is probably an underestimate because you'd have to do a bunch of things
*  before you got to that point in the process to even get the process off of the ground.
*  And it's not like they threw everything out the door.
*  They used union labor to rebuild this.
*  They had union labor going 24 hours a day, which would not normally be allowed.
*  But again, under the emergency rules, it was allowed.
*  And so it was not just a huge victory for Shapiro, making him quite popular or even
*  more popular than he was.
*  It was also a big victory for union labor in Pennsylvania, which it was this great
*  object lesson that the government and the unions can do this amazing thing super fast.
*  Now, on the other hand, to make the case for process, you can really imagine how in
*  government and given our history or look at any other country's history with government,
*  if you don't have pretty rigid rules on who you hire and how, it becomes patronage.
*  It becomes corruption.
*  Right.
*  People get elected and they give money to their friends and their friends give them
*  money to get elected.
*  And then you have a corrupt political system.
*  Like who would get contracts in a Trump administration if the government he ran could
*  give it to whomever he wanted with no review and no rules.
*  And on the other hand, if everybody's so happy about how this I-95 rebuild went and
*  Shapiro is happy about it and Joe Biden said he did an amazing job and the Biden
*  administration is very happy to tout their role in it.
*  If our emergency processes on some level are better than our default processes, isn't
*  that a problem?
*  I think that that's something that we have not done in a while is think about the cost
*  of what these processes add and whether they're worth paying.
*  Right.
*  A lot of these regulations came out of a desire to make sure that the process was
*  equitable.
*  And then when we see that process gets slowed down, there's also a cost and that
*  cost is disproportionately borne by the populations that we are often most concerned
*  about.
*  Of course, the procurement process, I mean, you're talking about the potential for
*  corruption, but there's also just a lot of really good reasons to want to have
*  review to make sure like, Hey, are we only ever considering people who are from a
*  certain race or certain background?
*  Are we giving people opportunities from different places?
*  And those are all laudable goals.
*  And I think that often when we're critiquing them, it can sound to other people
*  like you're saying like, Oh, it doesn't matter that these these impulses are not
*  important.
*  But the real issue is that we're not saying, OK, but who gets hurt in a world where
*  we can't build I-95 back up quickly?
*  Right.
*  If people can't get to work, if people can't take their kids to school, it's not
*  rich people who can overwhelmingly now in this day and age work remote or in a
*  previous age would not lose their jobs or would have a savings to rely on.
*  It's poor people, it's people from minority backgrounds, it's people who many of
*  these regulations are attempting to protect.
*  As you say, a lot of these processes are built at some level to protect groups
*  that particularly under post-New Deal, super growth liberalism got just run over,
*  sometimes literally run over, right?
*  Highways driven right through their communities.
*  And then this sort of whole infrastructure of I don't know if you want to call it
*  anti-growth liberalism or new left liberalism or something, but it emerges in
*  the 60s, 70s, 80s and grows through to today.
*  We have all these groups that are using these laws, environmental laws, procurement
*  laws, other things to stop really bad abuses from happening.
*  And so now these groups, this is the thing they have that gives them their reason for
*  existing. This is where their power comes from.
*  So I think this raises two questions.
*  One is this question of who do these groups represent?
*  Because, you know, when the California government or the federal government thinks
*  about what are we doing for environmental justice, that doesn't mean they're
*  putting together in a room a bunch of people who live in super disadvantaged
*  communities. It means they're putting together in a room a bunch of people who
*  run environmental justice groups.
*  But then the other question that I think it raises is a sort of macro micro problem
*  here, right? You were getting at it earlier in Denver.
*  You might want, in order to stop bad developments, to run everything on a
*  project by project basis.
*  If you believe the inability to develop quickly is harming people overall,
*  you might want to change the default, even though that gives you more individually
*  bad projects. But you get more housing overall and that makes houses cheaper,
*  helps evade homelessness, whatever.
*  And those two things actually do conflict.
*  Right. The tension here is a real tension.
*  Yeah. So on your first question, the government wants to know what does the black
*  community want? And they say, like, well, what are the groups that represent the
*  black community? So maybe we'll go to the NAACP.
*  They say we want to learn about environmental justice community.
*  So they'll go to the groups that have organized themselves to speak on behalf of
*  that issue. And you have this question of, OK, like,
*  is it true that the people in environmental justice communities have actually lent
*  their voice to these organizations?
*  And it's a very hard question to suss out because I think that many organizations
*  now, and this is coming out of political scientists, Scott Chappell has reached on
*  this call that talks about what has happened to nonprofits from membership to
*  management. So we used to kind of be members of these large scale organizations.
*  And now it's sort of like, maybe I'll send 20 bucks to the Sierra Club every month.
*  But, you know, I'm not really paying attention to what they're doing.
*  I just got a calendar at the end of the year.
*  And so that change in how people interact with these organizations that happen for
*  various reasons, lends some kind of skepticism to saying, like, you know, like
*  you're saying that you speak for this group.
*  What's your proof of that?
*  And so I think it's hard because it's not a question of, like, oh, do I think these
*  groups are acting in bad faith?
*  Because, I mean, what if you just can't get those groups to vote?
*  Like, what if you can't actually reach all those people?
*  What if it costs way too much money to canvas?
*  So should no one speak for them in that case?
*  That feels wrong. But then again, it feels wrong to have a group saying, hey, I'm
*  speaking for this group, but actually I have not even talked to even a tenth of
*  the members of it. And so I think that that's that's that is a very difficult
*  problem. I think it can be solved in a few ways.
*  I think one is that groups should then be held to a high standard of proving their
*  claims rather than just leaning on representational authority.
*  And what I mean by that is, you know, if I am someone who has like a poll and I
*  say, like, well, I know that 70 percent of people agree with this statement.
*  So that's why we should do it.
*  That's like one type of Democratic claim.
*  The second type is saying like, hey, we did the research.
*  Here are some arguments why I believe it is best for this group in order for us to
*  pass policy X. Those are two different arguments.
*  That does not rest on whether or not people agree with you.
*  It's just saying, I think it's better for them based on these measures, based on
*  this research, based on these arguments.
*  And so I think we should, A, like really default more towards the second when we
*  don't have evidence that the first is actually happening.
*  And then on your second question about kind of the macro micro problem, many of
*  the biggest successes of the environmental movement when we're talking about acid
*  rain or you're talking about DDT and even lead remediation.
*  These are situations where the environmental movement set specific standards and said,
*  we need to stop this thing from happening.
*  They just said like, this is bad.
*  We need to stop it. Here's a standard for which everyone is going to be held across
*  the board. It doesn't matter. That's just the rule now.
*  And that's very different than like, let's examine each one and look at it
*  holistically and decide whether or not it's good or not.
*  It's just setting a specific rule.
*  And I talked to developers.
*  They often tell me that they're less interested even in really loosening and
*  making it easier to build more housing or even to build different kinds of
*  renewable energy. They just want a consistent set of rules that they can just
*  follow because when these groups have certainty about how the system works, when
*  it's clear that it's not going to come to the discretion of some random agency here
*  or some bureaucrat there, and you don't have to worry that like one person's
*  public input or a group claiming to speak for some other community is going to come
*  in and then derail the whole thing.
*  Then you can say, OK, we're going to try and we're going to be able to build a lot
*  more things much more quickly.
*  So I think that standards should just be the focus of future regulatory changes in
*  this space.
*  Well, this also gets to a way that liberalism in America, and actually just
*  government in America, works differently and is held accountable differently than
*  it is in other countries we think of as peers like Western European countries and
*  Canada, which is a lot more of how this works in America is by lawsuit.
*  Here we have a lot of legislation at the both state and federal level where the
*  enforcement mechanism is we have given private or local groups or people a clear
*  pathway to suing the government.
*  And that creates very different dynamics.
*  Yeah.
*  So in 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act is passed, NEPA, then a bunch
*  of state versions of that get passed as well.
*  And it basically is a very short bill.
*  And all it says is that the government basically needs to account for all the
*  potential environmental harms before it approves of a project.
*  And at the time it was thought of, all you have to do is look at this project that
*  you're going to approve or this government action that you're going to do.
*  Let's spend a little bit of time thinking about whether this is harmful, maybe
*  adjust some things and then move forward.
*  And then there's a lot of activist courts in the 1970s who interpret the language
*  of this bill in a much larger way.
*  They say it's not just that you have to give us a four page document that says
*  here are a couple of things that we were worried about and we, you know, we thought
*  about, we changed some things, whatever.
*  You have to really show that you were thinking through the entire process, that
*  you were thinking very clearly about potential alternatives at every step.
*  And that sounds really good, right?
*  Like you're like, yes, I do want the government to not just do some shoddy
*  check mark at the end of the process.
*  I want them to really care about the environment.
*  But what the sense of meaning is that when government tries to do anything, it
*  has to assemble reports that can number into the thousands.
*  And this doesn't happen with every project.
*  And, but it does give room for people to sue not on the grounds that you have
*  harmed the environment or they think you're going to harm the environment, but
*  on the grounds that you have not actually done the procedure well.
*  So you have many of these lawsuits against things that we would obviously think
*  are bad, whether it's like pipe, new pipelines or oil fields or whatever it is.
*  And they're not really making the argument on the environmental grounds.
*  They're making the argument on procedure grounds.
*  And so you have all of these environmental organizations come up in this pace of
*  legal practice in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, who make this their bread and butter.
*  And they develop all this case law that really makes government accountable to
*  making sure that they are following a really strict procedure and it can take
*  years, it can cost tons of money.
*  It can take a lot of lawyers.
*  And so I do think that the legal system here plays a huge role, but at the same
*  time, it would be very possible for legislators to say, this is not what we
*  meant for you to do.
*  We did not mean for to hamper government to this extent.
*  We're going to reform what this legislation is saying to make it clear what
*  the parameters are and make it clear who's allowed to sue it under what conditions.
*  And so this is something that happened in Minnesota State House.
*  They're trying to reform one of their state environmental statutes, MIRA, the
*  Minnesota Environmental Rights Act, in order to make sure it doesn't allow for
*  some of these lawsuits to come about that can often not be focused on environmental
*  concerns, but using the procedural aspect of environmental litigation in order to
*  get something else done.
*  I was really stunned when I began digging into these laws over the past couple of
*  years to realize that they were about the process by which you build something and
*  what you consider in it and not showing that the thing you're trying to build is
*  better for the environment than not building it.
*  Congestion pricing in New York City has been held up for quite some time.
*  It's moving forward now.
*  And I ended up talking to a bunch of the players in that and they were, this was an
*  extraordinary situation where it got, it's a very simple thing.
*  You're just hanging sensors on poles more or less.
*  In order to charge cars coming in and out of the city.
*  So there are fewer cars and then you give that money to mass transit.
*  So there's more mass transit.
*  I mean, it's about as purely pro-environmental an approach as you can imagine.
*  And this is like the blue government of New York who's trying to do it.
*  And they're working now with the Biden administration, which also wants to do it.
*  And they end up in this multi-year environmental assessment because they want to
*  make sure they don't get sued.
*  And so they're doing things like, you know, how many cab drivers of color might be
*  displaced by something like this.
*  And it's not even that the considerations are bad considerations, but the fact that
*  it is holding up a very pro-environment piece of legislation that's actually not
*  considered in the thing at all.
*  The fact that the very process you're going through might itself be bad for the
*  environment is nowhere in the analysis.
*  There's also just a very strange version of this in California to keep going back
*  to that. And Jake Anvinder, the historian, has done really fantastic work on this.
*  But in California, they passed CEQA, the California Environmental Quality Act,
*  based on the national version, NEPA.
*  And when they pass it, nobody thinks it's a big deal.
*  I mean, this is passing in the heyday of environmental legislation.
*  It doesn't even get a full write up, a full article in the L.A.
*  Times. It's signed by Ronald Reagan.
*  Nobody thinks it matters much at all.
*  It's like, yeah, when the state does something, they need to consider the
*  environmental impact of it.
*  But then there's an effort to build a mixed condo and commercial development in
*  Mammoth. And if you know California, Mammoth is the greatest place to snowboard
*  and ski. There is. It's beautiful.
*  It's a resort. And this local coalition of homeowners in Mammoth, they sue and
*  they sue in this very novel way where they go to the courts and say, this needs
*  an environmental impact review.
*  And the assumption is, no, it doesn't.
*  It's not a state or public project.
*  But the California Supreme Court, they reinterpret the law and say, actually, a
*  public project is anything that requires public permits, which almost everything
*  does. And so now the law means something totally different than anybody had
*  initially believed.
*  There is like a complete shutdown in many ways of construction.
*  The state legislature has to pause the law so people can figure out what this
*  means for a little bit.
*  And now that same law has made it much harder to site housing, much harder to
*  site clean energy.
*  Now people are seeing some problems with it.
*  But it is a kind of crazy situation of how powerful the judicial role often is in
*  this.
*  Yeah, I think that people would be maybe surprised to realize that what's contained
*  within environmental considerations can literally basically be anything from, as
*  you said, noise to locals.
*  It could include public input processes because much of environmentalism became
*  very intertwined with concerns about participatory democracy.
*  And so you're making sure like, oh, well, did you just put one posting here or did
*  you put several postings in high visibility areas in town?
*  What was the size of the font in those postings?
*  I mean, there's so many considerations under the umbrella of environmentalism.
*  And what has happened is that a bunch of different actors have realized that
*  actually you could use this for anything.
*  You could use this to stop anything, no matter whether or not it is environmental.
*  Now, I think there are a lot of people who consider themselves environmentalists who
*  use these regulations to stop things that I would think are good.
*  But then there are a lot of people who are straightforwardly not environmentalists
*  who would use it. I mean, there was in Los Angeles, the L.A.
*  City Council had voted to end oil drilling and a privately held natural gas and oil
*  company sued under the California Environmental Quality Act.
*  And they're claiming that banning oil drilling in the lawsuit will increase
*  greenhouse gas emissions.
*  And they say that L.A. is depriving the public of an opportunity to meaningfully
*  comment on the measure and its feasibility.
*  And they pause. They're able to pause the silly council's ban on oil drilling as a
*  result of the California Environmental Quality Act.
*  So I think that's obviously a really absurd version of this, but I think it really
*  just speaks to how far away these laws have grown from the original intent.
*  This gets to me to this reality that there are two failure modes for this kind of
*  liberal governance. And one is a failure mode where a law is being used to do
*  something you did not mean for it to do.
*  Right. I think the people who passed these laws did not mean to allow the oil drilling
*  company to stop the oil drilling ban.
*  And then there's a failure mode of there's actually a disagreement, like a deep
*  disagreement in liberalism now over what to do.
*  And you talk about this quite a bit in your piece about Minnesota, about this tension
*  in environmentalism between those who are there for conservation and those who are
*  there for the climate crisis.
*  Do you want to talk a bit about that?
*  Yeah, sure. So the Minneapolis 2040 was this larger measure that tried to reshape how
*  Minneapolis would do zoning and land use policy for housing in the future.
*  And it spurred a bunch of changes that would make it easier to build more affordable
*  housing type, smaller houses, build more densely near transit, things like that, and
*  led to the elimination of parking minimums.
*  So things that were a lot of environmentalists have been really pushing for for a long
*  time. A lot of environmentalists in the area, including the local Sierra Club, have been
*  very in favor of this.
*  But then a few groups that were led by a newly formed group called Smart Growth, but
*  accompanied by two bird groups, including the local Audubon chapter, sued under the
*  Minnesota Environmental Rights Act in order to stop the Minneapolis from 2040 from
*  taking effect. And so when I first wanted to write the story, I was kind of like, OK,
*  like, there's this problem of people saying they're environmentalists, but obviously
*  they're not. And then I'd kind of been doing a lot of reading of this law professor,
*  Jedidiah Purdy. And as you mentioned, Jake Anbinder has written about this a lot, too.
*  And I started thinking a lot about how these individuals, it's not that they themselves
*  are lying about environmentalism, but the definition of environmentalism has changed
*  around them. So what I mean by that is that I kind of classify people into two groups,
*  this idea of crisis environmentalists and cautious environmentalists.
*  And if you're like me and I think like you, Ezra, you kind of grew up with environmentalism
*  as really meaning the climate crisis.
*  You learned about deforestation and you learned about wildfires and hurricanes and
*  polar bears, all of these things under the blanket crisis of we need to reduce carbon
*  emissions to stop all this from happening.
*  Younger folks also kind of grew up in a kind of more pro-technological version of this,
*  too, where we were saying, OK, we need to ride our bikes.
*  We need to get solar panels on our roofs.
*  It was very kind of technical.
*  It was returned to the city as well, too, many people who are urbanists.
*  But that's a very different culture than what environmentalism was for a lot of people
*  in the cautious space. Right.
*  So cautious environmentalists grew up there in the 60s and 70s.
*  And those are the people that really populated these groups that are suing to stop this
*  housing legislation. And for them, what they were thinking about when they thought about
*  environmentalism was the changes to their local places, whether there would be less
*  literal greenery around, whether there would be knock on effects of specific developments
*  and also this real commitment as part of environmentalism to slow, to process and to distrusting
*  government when it tried to do big projects because of the legacy of what the government
*  had done with knocking highways through and urban renewal in the mid 20th century.
*  And so when I think about that kind of tension, what I realized really clearly when talking
*  to them is that while I think that they're wrong, I think there's a better version of
*  environmentalism. And I think that it helps more people and that their version hurts more.
*  And they have very clear values that they view as very much in line with their version
*  of our mentalism. And that makes it actually much more difficult because it's not a simple
*  question of saying, well, don't you realize that you're the net carbon emissions if everyone
*  was going to live in a single family home versus living in a more densely packed area
*  or higher? That's not the answer.
*  They're not going to be won by fact.
*  It's about a values shift that we're seeing happen as generations trade over.
*  Yeah, I don't even love the language of lying or wrong or right here because there are
*  genuinely different visions about how life should work.
*  This is a bad coinage from my side of the argument, but I tend to think this is gray and
*  green environmentalism. There is an environmentalism that is largely about living in a
*  greener space. Right.
*  Don't let anybody build over the park.
*  Don't let that much building happen at all.
*  This environmentalism is often associated with fears of overpopulation.
*  There's simply too many humans.
*  The humans are consuming too many things.
*  The Earth cannot carry this much.
*  Do not let anybody bulldoze these trees.
*  And there's a lot to that. And I am emotionally very sympathetic to it.
*  And then gray environmentalism, the environmentalism of New York City, where the carbon
*  footprint per person is extraordinarily low.
*  If you want to be low carbon, low emissions, what you want to live in is a very large
*  probably gray building.
*  Not that the building has to be gray.
*  It could be any color, but a lot of them are gray.
*  And the city doesn't feel green at all.
*  The city does not feel like environmentalism.
*  It doesn't feel like living a life in harmony with nature.
*  And there is, I think, a difference of class here.
*  Like, I do think one of the problems is a lot of people who a lot of people want to
*  protect a green life they have been able to afford, but that other people now need to
*  live somewhere and they don't really have an answer for that.
*  The lifestyles the two sides are thinking of, I think, actually feel like different
*  lives. They live in different houses.
*  I mean, that's also, again, a financial question.
*  But there is a question of values here that I think can't be waved away.
*  Well, I'm going to push back again against this like gray versus green thing, I think
*  for a couple of reasons. One is one thing you said about like, well, it doesn't feel
*  environmental to live in New York City.
*  I think that people who ride their bikes to work and who are living in a downtown
*  city and don't have a car, I think they very much feel themselves like they're living
*  in a very environmental way, that they are able to take the train and go out to the
*  suburbs if they want to.
*  I'm using the term differently, not to go too far down this road.
*  I mean, like when I lived in a leafy part of Oakland for a while, when I walked around,
*  there were a lot of trees.
*  I lived for 10 weeks in Half Moon Bay on the shore.
*  I woke up and I saw the ocean.
*  And now I live in a five-story building and there are very few trees around me and
*  there's no wild space.
*  I actually do feel like I'm a better environmental citizen now for all those reasons.
*  But I don't feel the connection with nature.
*  I felt when I've lived in places that just literally my carbon emissions and my
*  electricity usage were higher.
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no contesting that.
*  I mean, of course, if you're in the middle heart of New Manhattan, you're not going to
*  see or in Brooklyn, you're not going to see the ocean in the same way on the coast.
*  But I also will say this, like the sense that you have a feeling connected to nature or
*  feeling close or or in harmony with nature, as you said, these things are socially
*  determined, right? Like the way you feel about your life and how it is.
*  Like the reason I'm saying pushing back on this is not because I don't recognize the
*  difference, but because I think that it's socially constructed in a way that we can
*  actually change.
*  What people often don't recognize is that when you live more densely is that you are
*  actually preserving a ton of that green space from development, right?
*  Because when Minneapolis says, I'm not going to build enough for my new residence,
*  when they say 30,000 people move here, but we're only building 10,000, 12,000 new homes,
*  those people don't disappear.
*  They still get those jobs.
*  They still come here to live with their family or to visit with their friends or whatever
*  it is. And where they need to stay goes to the outlying counties.
*  They are taking up more and more wetlands or conservation areas that are very local
*  still to these communities. And so those single family, that single family home sprawl
*  that exists and has continued to spread in major urban areas is the direct result of
*  not allowing dense infill development to happen in our cities.
*  And so to me, I think it's really interesting because I agree with you.
*  It changes how individuals feel, right?
*  Because if you're someone who is used to having your single family home and you're in
*  Minneapolis and you're using all this greenery and all these trees and all these parks
*  around you and it takes 10 minutes for you to get to this wildlife preserve and that
*  changes because it becomes a more populated place.
*  Maybe your day to day feels less what you would call green environmentalism, as you're
*  saying, but your community is actually preserving a ton more of that greenery.
*  So I think there's a lot of contradictions inherent in this that I think are often
*  resolved in a way that it's not logical.
*  It's just sort of like what we all decided it to be.
*  I agree with that totally. And I will say that, you know, one thing New York City does
*  well, at least in certain parts of it, is the density has also permitted these
*  tremendous public parks, right?
*  You can just if you pack more people together, you can also just bigger parks, right?
*  Prospect Park is a remarkable institution.
*  Central Park is a remarkable institution.
*  There are things you can do here that I think can lead you to more of a synthesis than
*  people recognize.
*  And I was talking to someone in my story in Minneapolis where he said he likes
*  Minneapolis because of all of the parks and greenery.
*  And he says, I don't want to live in a place like D.C. or New York.
*  But D.C. actually has a higher rate of park system than both Minneapolis and St.
*  Paul, which have great parks.
*  I was there and they do it while here in D.C.
*  We do it while permitting more homes than they do in Minneapolis.
*  And I think that that's something that's really counterintuitive for people.
*  I think that's totally right.
*  But when you think about the broad sweep of liberalism here for decades, this
*  liberalism that was and part of this environmentalism that was much more about
*  the cost of building too much.
*  And it had real reasons to worry about that, as you said.
*  That built a lot of structures.
*  It built statutes.
*  It built movements.
*  It built organizations.
*  It built local government processes.
*  And now you have this other thing emerging.
*  And one thing I'm tracking is it's actually very hard to change.
*  So when you look at California, they have passed a huge number of pro-housing bills
*  attacking all different levels of the system.
*  And if you look at housing starts in California, you can squint and see a bit of
*  an effect, but there's not been any transformation.
*  I was looking at Colorado where Richard Polis has been doing a lot of work on this.
*  Same thing. You're not seeing any transformation.
*  I've looked at New York.
*  Same thing. You're not seeing any transformation.
*  So this stuff is actually pretty hard to unwind.
*  Yeah. I mean, if we were having this conversation 10 or 15 years ago, Ezra, we
*  would be having it in sort of like a diagnosing a futile illness sort of way.
*  The way that political scientists talked about this problem, the way that activists
*  or people talk about this problem decades before was in a very resigned tone.
*  They're like, this is just the way that it is.
*  It's over. We've lost this.
*  This is going to be a problem for a really long time.
*  That was sort of the posture towards this entire problem.
*  And so the reason why I'm a little optimistic here is that I'm just shocked
*  that like basically any major legislation has been passed on this issue.
*  And it happened pretty rapidly over the course of the last few years.
*  I mean, 2020 was a real catalyst year when the rest of the country began seeing
*  the real impact of the run-up in housing costs and their local restrictions became
*  very relevant as they started experiencing that population growth.
*  And I do think that that is the beginning of how change actually works, right?
*  Like that you have environmental organizations, including Sierra Club
*  chapters that historically have been some of the largest barriers in certain
*  areas to trying to get some of these laws changed.
*  Now on the same side as people who are trying to make it easier to build more
*  housing and relax some of these environmental regulations, I think that
*  there's a real potential shift happening here.
*  Do I know that this is going to actually win out?
*  Like, no, I think there are a lot of strong forces arrayed against it.
*  There's just an asymmetry towards getting things done versus towards opposing it.
*  In order to get something done on this question, you have to align
*  so many different groups.
*  You have to align so many different interests.
*  You have to get real champions to take on political risks in order to do this.
*  And to work against the people that they're usually in coalitions with.
*  It is not an easy thing to do, but given that the expectation just a few years ago
*  was that very little would ever get done on this issue, I do feel optimistic.
*  All right.
*  Here's hoping always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Yeah.
*  So, um, my first few books are very much on those, these questions of how we got here.
*  How did we see all these regulations come up and what changed within liberalism
*  in the latter half of the 20th century?
*  The first is by Lily Geismur.
*  It's called Don't Blame Us.
*  And it's a book that looks very closely at the Boston suburbs to see the changes
*  that led to a lot of the regulations and opposition that is causing a lot of the
*  sclerosis we see today.
*  And then there's Bulldozer in the Countryside by Adam Rome.
*  It's another really great book about environmentalism and really kind of
*  situates environmentalism in the United States as coming up as a reaction to
*  changes in the urban core and suburbanization.
*  That that is really the catalyzing force for how it gets so many adherents is that
*  suburbanites really get concerned about the change in their communities.
*  This final book, I always like to recommend a fiction book on this.
*  So, well, it's not really fiction, but George Saunders' book, A Swim in the Pond
*  in the Rain is a book on writing.
*  But all really great books about writing are actually great books about thinking.
*  And so that one is one I read recently that has really helped change my writing
*  process, but also, I think fortify some of how I think through problems.
*  All great books about writing are really great books about thinking.
*  I love that.
