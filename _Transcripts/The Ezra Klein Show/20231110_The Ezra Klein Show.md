# What Israelis Fear the World Does Not Understand
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVeh-26rCdQ)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  This week on the show, we wanted to put a Palestinian narrative and perspective on this
*  moment and how we got to this moment on what is happening here alongside an Israeli one.
*  We had Amjad Iraqi, the Palestinian writer and policy analyst on the show on Tuesday.
*  If you haven't listened to that episode, I really urge you to do so.
*  And today we have Yossi Klein Halevi for an Israeli perspective, for a Zionist perspective.
*  Halevi is a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.
*  He's the author of, among other books, Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor.
*  He's somebody who spent quite a lot of his life trying to make the Israeli narrative
*  understood to others, a narrative he feels and has lived very deeply.
*  He's somebody who believes that narratives that are contradictory, narratives that even
*  oppose each other will have to be held at the same time, that reconciliation, if it
*  ever comes, is not going to come because one story gets judged true and the other false,
*  but because both stories and the many more can be held at the same time, respected, without
*  asking one to triumph over all the others.
*  At the same time, I want to recognize that this is not just a moment of stories.
*  This is a moment when real people have died and are dying, when real people have been
*  driven from their homes, when bombs are dropping.
*  There was a real massacre in Israel, not just a story.
*  There's a real invasion of Gaza.
*  And something else I wanted to talk to Halevi about as somebody who's covered quite a bit
*  of Israeli security, who has written a book on the Israeli military at one point, or at
*  least the story of the Israeli paratroopers, is how Israel is thinking about this moment
*  and what it is trying to achieve in the invasion of Gaza.
*  What does it mean to destroy Hamas?
*  What if it cannot do that?
*  What is the acceptable cost?
*  Is there a cost in civilians?
*  It is too much.
*  So we talked through that.
*  As with the previous conversation, not everything in this episode is easy to hear for everyone.
*  Not everything in this episode is something I agree with.
*  But I think it is important to hear.
*  I think it is important to understand what these two societies see right now.
*  The way they understand their interests, the way they understand their past, and the way
*  they understand what could potentially be in their future.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Yassi Klein Halevi, welcome to the show.
*  Great to be with you, Ezra.
*  Thank you.
*  I want to start with a little bit of your history.
*  You talk about being a soldier patrolling Gaza when you were younger, being part of
*  that occupation, and learning things on both sides from it.
*  What did you learn from it?
*  What did it change in your thinking?
*  So I was drafted into the Israeli army in the late 1980s, which was the period that
*  we call the First Intifada.
*  It's like the first Lebanon war.
*  We didn't know there was going to be a second or maybe a third.
*  We just called it the Intifada then.
*  And my unit served in the Gaza refugee camps.
*  We also served in the West Bank.
*  And I came out of that experience learning two things.
*  The first is that the rule over another people is untenable in the long term for a country
*  that wants to be both a democracy and maintain its Jewish majority.
*  And that was a lesson that I learned viscerally.
*  I learned it every day.
*  And it was an overwhelming experience.
*  The second experience was a direct encounter with the depth not only of Palestinian rage
*  and in many cases hatred, but with the negation of any legitimacy to Jewish state in any borders
*  just before our unit had gotten to Gaza.
*  An Israeli reservist driving through Gaza had made a wrong turn and ended up in a refugee
*  camp and was surrounded and burned alive.
*  And we used to get taunted every day that Amnon, who was that was his name, Amnon sends
*  you regards.
*  So my education was the futility of occupation on the one hand and on the other, deep questions
*  about whether we could really negotiate a two-state solution with the Palestinian national
*  movement that would be ready to accept the legitimacy of Israel in whatever borders.
*  That education has shaped my thinking to this day in the way that I would put it, Ezra,
*  that on the one hand, I believe that a Palestinian state is an existential need for Israel.
*  And I also believe it's an existential threat, especially given what we've just experienced
*  on October 7, the possibility of taking the risk of withdrawing from the West Bank anytime
*  soon and bringing Hamas to within literally five minutes of Tel Aviv is simply inconceivable
*  for Israelis today, I would say virtually across the political spectrum.
*  But the one thing that I will say, just to counter that a little bit, is that I've learned
*  in Israel really never to make definitive statements about the future.
*  Even in the near future, because it's so unpredictable.
*  This is such a radically fluid reality.
*  A month ago, I was standing in the streets literally every week with hundreds of thousands
*  of Israelis demonstrating against the Netanyahu government.
*  Today, this is suddenly the most unified country that we've been for decades.
*  We keep going from one contradictory reality to the next, and that's so built into the
*  Israeli experience.
*  And in a paradoxical way, that gives me some hope for the future, because those who say
*  a two-state solution is over, it's dead, it's finished, so how do you know?
*  Look at what just happened in Israel in the last five weeks.
*  How can you make any definitive statement about this crazy place?
*  You had mentioned the first Intifada, and I want to talk about how both Intifadas changed
*  Israeli politics.
*  And so beginning with what, as you put it, nobody knew was the first one at the time.
*  What was the first Intifada, and how did Israel react to it?
*  How did it change Israeli politics?
*  Well, the first Intifada broke out in 1987, and it lasted more or less until the first
*  Gulf War, 1991.
*  It was basically riots.
*  It was young people, large, very large numbers, hundreds, thousands of young people, throwing
*  stones, sometimes Molotov cocktails, every so often a terror attack, but primarily it
*  was the Palestinians call it the Intifada of stones.
*  And that's how I personally experienced it.
*  I got a stone thrown to my head, and I was briefly hospitalized for that.
*  Luckily, I had a helmet on, and I still blacked out.
*  And there was something visceral about experiencing Iraq in your head, because Iraq is a symbol
*  of powerlessness, David and Goliath.
*  And it was this encounter with Gaza's rage.
*  And I also had a very complicated experience.
*  I came to respect these Palestinian teenagers who were throwing rocks at my friends and me.
*  We were armed, and there was a great deal of courage.
*  And I recognized myself as a teenager in their rage.
*  I was a very strong participant in Jewish activism when I was a teenager in the late
*  60s, early 70s in the Soviet Jewry movement, in the violent wing of the Soviet Jewry movement
*  fighting police at the Soviet mission.
*  And I identified to some extent with these kids, and I felt this grudging respect for
*  them.
*  And so it was a very complicated dynamic.
*  I came out of that experience saying, there's no way to suppress this.
*  We're going to have to come to terms with Palestinian nationalism.
*  And this was true for a very large number of Israelis.
*  I saw it happening in the army.
*  And every night we would have arguments in our tent camp in Gaza.
*  You saw even people on the right saying, something has to give here.
*  This isn't working.
*  And the political consequence of the first Intifada was the election of Yitzhak Rabin
*  in 1992.
*  Rabin ran on the slogan, take Gaza out of Tel Aviv.
*  That was the winning post-Intifada slogan of Israeli politics.
*  Separation.
*  Whatever they wanted to do, a state, give them a state.
*  There was something of that mood in Israeli society.
*  A realization that we can't swallow another people.
*  A people that doesn't want to be part of us and whom we don't see as part of the identity
*  we're trying to create in Israel.
*  So it was a moment of possibility.
*  A year later, the Oslo peace process, and that again, a direct outgrowth of the first
*  Intifada.
*  The Israel won the first Intifada.
*  We suppressed the riots.
*  It took four or five years.
*  But the riots stopped.
*  But we lost.
*  And we all knew we lost the first Intifada because you can't win that kind of conflict.
*  And the 90s, at least the early 90s, was the time where people like me who had experienced
*  the Intifada literally in our being felt we needed to try a different way.
*  So then let me ask the same question of the second Intifada.
*  What was it?
*  What were the tactics of it?
*  And how did it change Israeli politics and society?
*  So the second Intifada broke out in the year 2000, September 2000.
*  The second Intifada was the Intifada of suicide bombings.
*  And that went on for five years.
*  Those were the longest five years of my life.
*  And I was raising two teenagers in Jerusalem at the time.
*  Jerusalem was one of the main center points of the suicide bombings.
*  And my kids had numerous close encounters.
*  And they both lost friends.
*  Friends were wounded.
*  That Intifada changed Israeli politics in the opposite way of the first Intifada.
*  It brought the right to power pretty much permanently over the last 20 plus years.
*  And it wasn't only the intensity of the terrorism.
*  It was the fact that it happened after Israel had said yes to two peace offers.
*  Now, the Palestinians have a very different version of what I'm about to tell you.
*  I'm going to give you the Israeli narrative of what happened.
*  Almost all Israelis deeply believe this, as do I.
*  This is my narrative of what happened as well.
*  And that is that at Camp David in July 2000, Israel put an offer on the table of an Israeli
*  withdrawal, a Palestinian state.
*  It would have involved uprooting dozens of settlements, redividing Jerusalem.
*  And on the Palestinian side, it would have expected the Palestinians to contract the
*  right of return, not to the literal lost homes of the 1948 war in what is now the state of
*  Israel, but to a part of the Palestinian homeland that would be a Palestinian state, which is
*  to say the West Bank and Gaza.
*  And Arafat walked away from that offer.
*  Six months later, President Clinton put on the table what he called the Clinton proposals,
*  which essentially changed the territorial withdrawal to the equivalent of 100 percent.
*  And I say equivalent because Israel would have kept about four to five percent of the
*  West Bank that's closest to the border in exchange for territory within pre-1967
*  sovereign Israel.
*  And Clinton adopted the Israeli position that the Palestinians have to confine the right
*  of return to a Palestinian state and not to the state of Israel.
*  And the Palestinians claim that Arafat did not reject it.
*  The Israelis claim that Arafat did reject it.
*  This is all by way of trying to explain what the second Intifada did to the Israeli psyche.
*  If you believe that your side genuinely tried to make peace and received in return the worst
*  wave of terrorism in Israel's history, then your first conclusion is going to be that
*  the Israeli left, which promised us peace now, are simply fools.
*  And that's exactly what happened.
*  The Israeli left collapsed immediately after the second Intifada began.
*  And it never recovered.
*  The Labor Party today is the smallest party in Parliament.
*  Four seats.
*  The Zionist Party to the left of Labor called Meretz isn't even in Parliament.
*  That was the shift of the second Intifada.
*  There are a lot of claims and counterclaims about the offers made and who rejected them
*  and whether or not the state would have been a viable entity in the way it was offered.
*  And to be honest, I don't myself have a very strong opinion on this.
*  You can believe sort of any number of things about how good the offers were and whether
*  or not the Palestinians should have taken them.
*  And that can be separate from your belief about what follows.
*  A multi-year terrorism campaign targeting civilians in the most crowded public spaces
*  that the attackers can find.
*  And so I just wanted to spend a moment on that.
*  I think metaphors and comparisons to the Holocaust and to 9-11 are very dominant right now in
*  the Western conversation.
*  But when I talk to Israelis, what I hear as being the most dominant near experience or
*  maybe one, the Yom Kippur War, but very much to the second Intifada, which shapes, I think,
*  all thinking about what are the terms under which security can and cannot be attained.
*  Yeah, it's interesting because my father raised me with the consciousness that the non-Jewish
*  world is divided into two kinds of people.
*  There are those who actively want to kill us and there are those who are glad that someone
*  else is doing the job.
*  And my maturation process was learning to break from that survivor mindset that my father
*  really tried to impose on me.
*  And I understand why, given his experience.
*  But in the 1990s, parts of Israeli society were beginning to distance ourselves, and
*  I was certainly very much part of that, from an excessive dependence on the Holocaust as
*  a framing for Israeli and Jewish identity.
*  There was a very positive, really healthy conversation that was beginning.
*  And then the second Intifada happens and all of the trauma returns.
*  And the Jewish survival button was pushed.
*  And that's a very dangerous thing for the enemies of Israel to do, because when that
*  button is pushed, you can't win.
*  So I think this gets at this important, sometimes disconnect, I think, between how Israel sees
*  itself and how it's seen by the world.
*  In its early decades, Israel saw itself, and I think was, and was seen this way, as a fairly
*  weak country.
*  It was really threatened with eradication.
*  By the second Intifada, and certainly today, Israel is a strong country.
*  It has a powerful military.
*  It has a big economy.
*  So could you talk about that shift and the way that the external perception of Israel
*  and its strength is not always mirrored in the Israeli psyche and the way Israel understands
*  itself?
*  I think you're pointing to one of the seminal disconnects between how Israelis view their
*  situation and how outsiders perceive Israel.
*  Israelis are certainly aware of the power they have, both economic and military.
*  But we experience our existence in the Middle East as vulnerable.
*  Being vulnerable is not the same as being a victim.
*  Israelis don't consider themselves victims.
*  Even after the massacre of October 7th, it's not in the Israeli mindset to see ourselves
*  as victims.
*  Victimhood isn't considered noble at all in Israel, where the Israeli ethos is a response
*  to victimhood.
*  It's an attempt to erase the victimhood of the Jewish people.
*  But we do feel acutely vulnerable.
*  And the reason for that is that people abroad tend to think of the Middle East conflict
*  as Israel versus the Palestinians.
*  And through that lens, Israel is Goliath and the Palestinians are David.
*  But if you widen the map, if you look at Israel in the region, we experience the Middle East
*  conflict as literally that.
*  The Middle East, or much of the Middle East, against the Jewish state.
*  That's been the reality.
*  And so Israelis have a kind of a split screen in our heads when we think of the conflict.
*  One side is mighty Israel against the powerless Palestinians, and the other side is vulnerable
*  Israel against a vast Arab and Muslim world.
*  And the more vulnerable you make us, the more traumatized we become, the more we feel we're
*  in a survival mode, the harder we push back.
*  When Israelis break, and we really broke on October 7th, we don't break in the way that
*  Hamas and its allies anticipated.
*  We don't fall apart.
*  We come together.
*  And look at how we came together on October 8th.
*  Literally, on October 6th, we were at each other's throats.
*  I was really worried about a civil war in Israel.
*  And then October 7th happens, the single greatest trauma in Israel's history.
*  I look back on the Second Intifada now.
*  In the Second Intifada, for five years of suicide bombings, a thousand Israelis were
*  killed.
*  We lost 1,400 people the first day of this war on October 7th.
*  So the dimensions are something that we've never experienced before.
*  The fatal mistake, and I believe it is a fatal mistake, of Hamas and it will be a fatal mistake
*  of Hezbollah if they join the war, is that you cannot defeat this people from that place,
*  that mindset of existential threat.
*  And what's so astonishing, and this is also part of this deep disconnect between the Israeli
*  psyche and so much of the outside world, is the outside world sees a war between Israel
*  and Hamas.
*  And we see this as an existential war for salvaging our credibility as a country able
*  to defend itself.
*  And that really will have long-term consequences.
*  I want to hold on the pre-October 7th equilibrium for one more question before we move fully
*  into it, which is, as somebody who, I mean, I've been to Israel a number of times.
*  I care about Israel.
*  I used to be more involved on the peace side in this issue.
*  In between the Second Intifada and October 7th, one thing that had become very unclear
*  to me, depressingly, frighteningly unclear, was what the implicit theory was of both long-term
*  Israeli security, but also justice.
*  So you had a blockade on Gaza and a sort of immiseration of the Gazan people, which Hamas
*  bears quite a bit of responsibility for, but was also enforced by Israel.
*  You had a lot of settlement activity in the West Bank.
*  You had Israeli politics moving further and further right.
*  You had no real effort to negotiate with Abbas.
*  And Netanyahu says in closed-door Likud meetings, they did sort of a strategy to keep the Palestinians
*  divided.
*  And there was a sort of security, right?
*  There was a wall.
*  There had been the withdrawal from Gaza.
*  It seemed that the theory was, to me, that you could keep this stable and keep a lid
*  on the dangers with sort of anti-rocket systems, with a wall, with surveillance, with intelligence.
*  But there's no longer a sense that there was or could be or was really a need for any kind
*  of political solution.
*  So how would you describe what people in Israel thought the long term of this looked like
*  on 10-1?
*  You know, we were living with several illusions of these last two decades.
*  One illusion was that we can maintain the status quo indefinitely.
*  When you have a status quo, you create a vacuum in which the most determined part of Israeli
*  society can take advantage.
*  And that happened to be the settlers.
*  They know exactly where they want to bring us.
*  The rest of us don't really know.
*  We're confused.
*  It wasn't that we don't need a solution.
*  It's that a solution is impossible.
*  It's unattainable.
*  That was the imprint of the Second Intifada.
*  The combined Israeli reading of we offered the Palestinian leadership peace, we got back
*  the Second Intifada in return.
*  The result of that was there's no point.
*  There's no one to make peace with.
*  Now it's true that for most of the last two decades, we didn't offer a credible vision
*  peace, with one major exception, which was Prime Minister Eur Elmerd offered Mahmoud Abbas,
*  the president of the Palestinian Authority, effectively a total Israeli withdrawal.
*  And it's true that Elmerd was already a lame duck, and his days as prime minister were
*  numbered when he made that offer.
*  But if you're the head of a people that's under occupation, and your goal is a two-state
*  solution and the Israeli prime minister has just offered you a credible vision of a Palestinian
*  state, do you just walk away or do you pocket that offer and then say, well, the previous
*  prime minister made this offer and you present this to the following prime minister?
*  In other words, there is such a fundamental lack of seriousness on the part of the Palestinian
*  leadership toward extracting their people from occupation that my conclusion, as somebody
*  who desperately believes that we need a long-term two-state solution, I'm emphasizing right
*  now in the middle of this war, long-term, that I don't believe that even if you had
*  the most left-wing government in power in Israel today, that we'd be able to reach
*  an agreement with the Palestinian National Movement in any of its factions.
*  And if I believe that, I think it's fair to say that most Israeli Jews believe that as
*  well.
*  I see it as a tragedy.
*  The settlement movement and its supporters see that as a victory.
*  But I think that a majority of Israelis don't know what to think anymore.
*  And I'm there too right now, Ezra.
*  I don't know what to think right now.
*  One thing I've heard from Palestinians I've spoken to, without justifying what Hamas did,
*  is a sense that Palestinians had tried many nonviolent efforts to move the Israeli state
*  to change perception towards them.
*  What they could do in the first intifada, given the integration of the societies, was
*  no longer true.
*  Now that the fence was up, now that the separations are what they are.
*  And so there are things like the boycott movement, which I think Israel treated as a quite profound
*  threat and got criminalized in many places.
*  There was the march of return that ended up having a number of Palestinians killed during
*  it.
*  And they felt stymied is too soft a word.
*  From your perspective, what is it that Palestinians could have or should have done in this period
*  that would have worked to open up a different set of possibilities here?
*  Two things.
*  The first is an acceptance of the indigenousness of the Jewish people in this land.
*  No Palestinian leader that I know has said that.
*  The second is the practical application of acceptance of a Jewish majority state, which
*  is not to make a peace agreement contingent on Israel accepting vast numbers of the descendants
*  of refugees back into the 1967 state, which would destroy the Jewish majority.
*  In other words, from the perspective of an overwhelming majority of Israeli Jews, the
*  key is the legitimacy of a Jewish majority state.
*  Now you mentioned BDS, you mentioned the march of return.
*  The BDS movement is committed to what Palestinians call the right of return.
*  The march of return was literally that.
*  We are going to inundate Israel with the descendants of Palestinian refugees.
*  BDS and the march of return were both, we can say, technically peaceful.
*  BDS was peaceful.
*  March of return was accompanied by a great deal of violence.
*  But the march of return and BDS have as their goal the destruction of Israel.
*  Now I don't care if you destroy Israel through October 7th or through a march of return,
*  because in the end the result will be the unbearable vulnerability of Israeli Jews who
*  will no longer be able to defend themselves.
*  And in that sense, there's no difference between that and the goal of October 7th.
*  There's a difference in tactic.
*  But what I'm looking for is not a change in tactic.
*  I'm looking for a change in goal.
*  Are you still committed to the destruction of a Jewish state through peaceful means?
*  Thank you very much.
*  That's a non-starter for me.
*  You are trying to destroy the last best hope of the Jewish people.
*  And I don't care if it's technically anti-Semitic or not.
*  I actually don't care if the motive is anti-Semitic.
*  The intent here doesn't matter.
*  The consequence will be the effective destruction of the Jewish people.
*  We will not survive as a people without the state of Israel.
*  In your heart of hearts, how do you think the average Palestinian sees you and sees
*  Israel?
*  At your most honest, what do you think they really think of you?
*  I would say that until October 7th, and I'll explain why in a moment, your average Palestinian
*  thought two things about Israel.
*  One is it has no legitimacy.
*  It is a country that's based on theft and lies.
*  There was no ancient Jewish presence in this land.
*  It's all a Zionist myth.
*  The Holocaust is probably either an exaggeration or an outright lie.
*  And that's what Palestinian society hears routinely from its media, from its leaders.
*  And on the other hand, I sense that the average Palestinian had a certain admiration for Israel,
*  an admiration for Israel's success, for the fact that we've proven that we're ready to
*  sacrifice ourselves for this country.
*  The deep love and attachment that we have, in a way, proves that we're an indigenous
*  people.
*  In the same way, and that's what I respect about Palestinians, that deep attachment to
*  the land and the willingness to sacrifice for the land.
*  And I think that the paradox here is that on the one hand, they see us as a colonialist
*  intrusion and on the other hand, they see Israelis as behaving exactly as they do, which
*  is how an indigenous people fights for its land.
*  Let's talk about October 7th and its aftermath now.
*  You said something in a conversation with Rabbi David Volpe that I found very important,
*  which was that even beyond the murders, even beyond the hostages, that a core trauma here
*  was that Israel had become the most dangerous country in the world for Jews, that the fundamental
*  contract of the Israeli state had been broken.
*  With the Jewish people.
*  With the Jewish people.
*  Yes.
*  Can you talk about that dimension of it, the sort of cracking of the Israeli narrative about
*  itself?
*  When Israelis used to say never again, we didn't mean that never again would there be
*  an existential threat to the Jewish people, because that's out of our control.
*  What we did mean is that never again would Jews die in a state of helplessness.
*  The lasting trauma, the greatest trauma that's going to be with us, I would say for generations,
*  is that a thousand Israeli civilians, there were 1,400 killed altogether, about 400 were
*  soldiers, but a thousand Israeli civilians died with their hands bound behind their backs
*  in the most horrific ways that Jews have ever been murdered.
*  And it happened within the borders of a sovereign Jewish state, with the Israeli army seemingly
*  incapacitated for hours.
*  That is a historic, it's not just a failure, it's a collapse of the Israeli ethos, it's
*  a collapse of our most basic sense of ourselves, of what this country is about.
*  And that's also what we're fighting for today.
*  And a lot of well-intentioned people will tell us ceasefire and don't understand what's
*  at stake here for Israel.
*  I think there's a big question mark all over the Arab and Muslim worlds about whether Israel
*  is really viable in the long term.
*  The defeat, the humiliation of October 7th was so profound.
*  The fact that we were beaten by the weakest of our enemies, which is how we always related
*  to Hamas.
*  Hamas is the least of our problems.
*  We've got Hezbollah, we've got Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Syria, and Iran, of course, hovering
*  in the background.
*  To be defeated so totally by Hamas means that we don't have deterrence anymore.
*  And that, by the way, is what this war is about, most of all for Israel.
*  And we all know it here.
*  This is the war to restore the credibility of Israeli deterrence.
*  I want to quote something you said on that, because I found it very important.
*  You said, in recent days, I've received messages from friends abroad warning me that Israel
*  is about to repeat the mistakes America made in Afghanistan and Iraq.
*  You're walking into a trap, they say.
*  There is no quick fix.
*  Hamas is an idea, not just a movement.
*  And you go on to say that I fear they may be right, but those concerns are irrelevant
*  to Israel's most urgent need, which is the immediate restoration of our shattered deterrence.
*  What is deterrence, and what is the way in which what Israel is now doing, its current
*  strategy, restores deterrence?
*  I think there are two aspects.
*  There is an external deterrence toward the enemies on our borders, and there's an internal
*  reassurance to Israeli citizens that we're still capable of protecting ourselves.
*  In some ways, the internal deterrence is more important.
*  If we stop believing that this country can fulfill its historic role of being a safe
*  refuge for the Jewish people, many Israelis will leave.
*  You know, Israelis, like Jews all around the world, have a very healthy personal sense
*  of survival.
*  We don't only have a collective sense of survival here.
*  We also know, you know, it might be time to leave.
*  Jews in France have that sense, and anti-Semitism is now rising phenomenally in Europe, especially
*  in France and England.
*  And until October 7th, many French Jews, in response to what's happening there, would
*  have immediately applied for immigration to Israel.
*  I don't know if that's going to happen now.
*  And so the long-term consequences of October 7th are core to what this country is about.
*  And in terms of the external deterrence, I think that our enemies need to know that we're
*  not afraid to die in war.
*  And there's this sense, and you hear it from Hamas, you hear it from Hezbollah, you hear
*  it from the Iranian regime, that Muslims don't fear death, we embrace death.
*  We're fearless.
*  The Jews are cowards, they cling to life.
*  And yes, the Jews certainly cling to life, and that's, I think, one of the most beautiful
*  aspects of Judaism.
*  But there are moments where you're ready to sacrifice your life.
*  This is one of those defining moments.
*  I have a couple questions about that.
*  So one, what makes you think, or what makes Israelis think, that Hamas or Israel's enemies
*  in the region had ceased to believe that about Israel?
*  I mean, the one thing that I feel like everybody said universally as soon as this happened
*  was that, of course, this would create an overwhelming Israeli response, that there
*  would be a huge, huge, huge attack on Gaza.
*  That was part of the calculus of the conflict, in a way.
*  Well, Israel hasn't won a war since 1973.
*  And every war since was an asymmetrical conflict.
*  You can't win an asymmetrical war unless you're ready to go all the way.
*  And Israel was not ready to go all the way.
*  It is now.
*  But our track record of the last 50 years has by no means been definitive and, frankly,
*  not necessarily impressive.
*  That's one aspect of this.
*  The other is that the more that Israel has become economically successful, the more we've
*  come to resemble a consumerist Western society, the more the perception has grown that we're
*  soft.
*  And many Israelis felt that way as well.
*  The head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, gave a famous speech, I don't know, 15 years ago,
*  where he compared Israel to a spiderweb.
*  And he said that just as a spiderweb appears to be impenetrable from the outside, and then
*  when you swipe it, it disintegrates.
*  That's Israel.
*  And the Ayatollah Khamenei famously said, I think it was in 2015 or 16, that Israel
*  has 25 years until its destruction.
*  There are doomsday clocks on street corners in Iranian cities that are marking time to
*  the demise of Israel.
*  And my sense is that Hamas expected another round of fighting, maybe more intense than
*  the last 15 years.
*  But I think that they believed we would be deterred for two reasons.
*  First of all, the fact that they now have Israeli hostages.
*  This is an unprecedented situation.
*  They're holding 240 plus hostages.
*  And the second is I think that they were depending on world opinion, that at some point, world
*  opinion will conclude that this has gone too far, and Israel is out of control, and
*  the price is too high, and innocent Palestinians are paying a price for what Hamas did.
*  All the scenarios that are playing out now.
*  You said a few minutes ago that Israel does not want a war outright since the 70s because
*  it's not been willing to go all the way.
*  What does it mean to go all the way?
*  Well, I think that we're seeing that in Gaza now.
*  So going all the way means continuing this war with all of the horrific consequences
*  and even endangering large numbers of Israeli civilians.
*  Now how that's actually going to play out?
*  Will Israelis have the stomach for staring down Hamas over the hostages?
*  I don't know.
*  I really don't know.
*  So I've had two thoughts through a lot of this.
*  One is that the Israeli determination to destroy Hamas is almost the basic function of a state
*  right now.
*  That there's no state in the world that would absorb the kind of attack Hamas conducted
*  and not do everything in its power to rip it out root and branch.
*  And also that sometimes where I would expect to hear a description of how Israel is going
*  to do the thing that it is promising to do at acceptable cost, and I am somebody who
*  believes there are unacceptable costs that end up backfiring against the very things
*  you're trying to preserve, I've not heard much.
*  And I think one of the things that has unnerved me more is that the truth is, and I don't
*  think this is all that unusual even within Israel, I don't have very much faith in the
*  Israeli government.
*  I mean Netanyahu has been a disaster, but also the Israeli Defense Forces were able
*  to see a huge amount of open air training and what they thought were war games and there
*  was intelligence coming up through their people and still couldn't see what was about to happen.
*  And so then the idea that they have the level of intelligence needed to know if the 7,000
*  targets they bombed are the right targets, or when they invade Gaza, which houses to
*  go into.
*  That's been a real question for me that it seems that Hamas might want to lure Israel
*  into this.
*  And it's not 100% clear that Israel knows what it is in, that right now just having
*  Netanyahu or the IDF say, trust us, we have the knowledge here, the intelligence, a sense
*  of kind of Palestinian informers and psychology needed to conduct this such that we achieve
*  our goals beyond just showing that we are willing to go to all out war.
*  That's been a point of real concern and I'm curious how you think about that.
*  Yeah, well first I would just quibble with you about one point you said you don't have
*  a whole lot of faith in Netanyahu.
*  I have less than zero faith in Netanyahu.
*  I think he is an unqualified historic disaster for Israel, especially over the last year.
*  The fact that he's technically the prime minister at this moment.
*  And I say technically because for a vast number of Israelis, he has no authority anymore.
*  He has no moral legitimacy.
*  What does give me some confidence is that we have Benny Gantz, the head of one of the
*  opposition parties, and a former IDF chief of staff now sitting in government together
*  with his party.
*  And there are any number of serious military people who've joined the government with Benny
*  Gantz.
*  And Benny Gantz is also running in the polls as far and away the most popular choice for
*  next prime minister and in all likelihood he will be the next prime minister.
*  In terms of the army, you know, it's hard to know what's worse if you have the intelligence
*  and you fundamentally misread it or you don't have the intelligence.
*  In this case, the army did have intelligence and they misread it.
*  They misread it because of a doctrine which Netanyahu promoted all these years and the
*  army adopted.
*  The army is certainly not free of blame here.
*  And the doctrine was that Hamas is too weak to attack us.
*  I feel, and the polls show that this is true for a strong majority of Israelis, that the
*  people running the army are still trustworthy.
*  Look, when this war ends, they will all have to resign along with the government.
*  This generation of leaders, both politically and militarily, are finished.
*  I believe that they are able to fight this war in the same way that the IDF command in
*  1973 was able to very effectively fight the Yom Kippur War, even though they had failed
*  to anticipate it.
*  And so I have trust in the current leadership.
*  I think it's a tragedy that we're going to lose them because they, as I say, every one
*  of them is going to have to resign.
*  We're going to see a total turnover of generations, certainly militarily and hopefully politically.
*  But I do believe that they're capable of reading the map now.
*  And look, I only have one IDF.
*  The Jewish people only has one IDF.
*  And in Hebrew we say, you know, zemayesh, that's what we've got.
*  And so for lack of an alternative, I trust the IDF.
*  You described earlier feeling for many, many years, and I thought it was frankly the correct
*  feeling, genuinely confused about what the right path forward was, right?
*  That there was a kind of status quo and the status quo was unsatisfying.
*  But there wasn't an obvious answer here.
*  And I've felt that then, but I also feel that now.
*  One of the particular ways in which I feel that I take seriously the importance of deterrence.
*  I also take seriously something that you gestured at, the idea that Hamas and things like Hamas
*  are an idea as much as an organization.
*  And that the rage Israelis feel when their countrymen, when their brothers and sisters
*  are killed, is also shared by Palestinians when their brothers and sisters and fathers
*  and mothers and children are killed.
*  And that if 15 or 20,000 Gazans die, that that is a rage that will find its way to being
*  answered.
*  I'm not convinced you can destroy Hamas.
*  I've talked to terrorism experts and people who study counterterrorism and this kind of
*  asymmetric thing.
*  I'm not sure there is a, you can go so far such that things like Hamas do not emerge.
*  What do you think about that side of it?
*  Again, recognizing that you have to do something to degrade Hamas.
*  And also that that many more grieving people is its own kind of powder keg.
*  When you think of not just the day after, but the 20 years after, how do you balance
*  those considerations?
*  Look, it's a really important question.
*  I would just pick up for a moment on the word degrade that you used.
*  It's the dividing line between the normative Israeli position, a position on the street,
*  a position in the army and government, and probably the position in the West even among
*  many of our supporters, which is maybe it's enough to just degrade Hamas.
*  And the position here is that if the Hamas leadership remains in Gaza and they emerge
*  from the ruins of this war with the V-sign, then October 7th stands.
*  And this is a war against October 7th.
*  And it's not enough to degrade Hamas.
*  Now I take very seriously what you're saying.
*  This could poison any possibility for reconciliation for God knows the next generation.
*  That's one possibility.
*  There's another option.
*  And this has also happened in the Middle East.
*  And that is that after the Yom Kippur War, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin made peace.
*  And nobody saw that coming until Sadat got off a plane at Ben Gurion Airport.
*  Now this is different.
*  That was a war between armies.
*  And this war is a war of one home front against the other.
*  This is a civilian war as much as anything else.
*  Those are much more bitter conflicts.
*  So do I really think that the Sadat-Begin scenario is what's going to come out of this?
*  I don't.
*  But I'm not sure.
*  And I think a lot depends on what happens in the wider Arab and Muslim worlds on the
*  morning after.
*  If there is a willingness to sit down with Israel and say, OK, it can't go on this way,
*  here's what we need, what do you need?
*  Before we even bring in the Palestinians.
*  And then if that dynamic begins, then you turn to the Palestinian question.
*  Now obviously that can't happen with this Israeli government.
*  But I believe that there will be enormous political changes in Israel when this is over.
*  And before we really can think about questions in the region and relations certainly with
*  the Palestinians, there's going to need to be a political upheaval in this country, the
*  likes of which we've never seen before.
*  And that's coming.
*  I want to pick up on something you said there about this question of normative goals and
*  then what I would call this question of maybe limits.
*  Because I wouldn't frame degrading Hamas or using that language around it as a normative
*  goal.
*  I would like to see Hamas eradicated.
*  I am not sure the eradication is possible.
*  And I think for people in America certainly, and people sort of more on the left in America,
*  the absolutely dominant experience here is 9-11.
*  And after 9-11 actually there being a very similar dynamic in the conversation here.
*  That America has lost its deterrence.
*  That it needs to show resolve.
*  That people sort of with us or against us.
*  And a feeling, including from those of us like me who made mistakes in what they supported
*  or didn't support then, that our friends who stood with us like Tony Blair actually enabled
*  us in doing something terrible for us.
*  I mean for others too.
*  But in many ways I would say the US is still deformed by the mistakes we made in 9-11.
*  And the sense that we have limits that we didn't take seriously before.
*  That's why I sort of sometimes switch between this question of destroying Hamas and degrading
*  it.
*  Because I understand destroying it as a goal.
*  I understand in some ways degrading it as more of a possibility.
*  And I guess I would ask maybe to frame it as an actual question.
*  What do you take from the 9-11 experience?
*  Well it's interesting.
*  I actually was in Manhattan.
*  I was visiting the states on 9-11.
*  And I was standing on Fifth Avenue looking at the towers burning.
*  And I was there in the aftermath.
*  And I don't like to make these comparisons.
*  But what didn't happen on 9-11 and what did happen here was a kind of an intimate mass
*  murder.
*  The Israelis who were killed were tortured, were dismembered, were burned.
*  It was an intimate encounter.
*  And the horror of that, especially when you're dealing with the Jewish psyche, is simply
*  overwhelming.
*  The other piece of course is that Al-Qaeda wasn't sitting in New Jersey.
*  It's also the geographical intimacy of October 7th.
*  So I do take the 9-11 precedent and the American failure seriously.
*  I think that Israel needs to listen to those warnings.
*  But also those who admonish us also need to understand the limits of historical relevance
*  here.
*  And I don't quite know what to compare this to.
*  An unprecedented attack requires an unprecedented response.
*  You're right.
*  Hamas is an idea.
*  We won't uproot Hamas.
*  But ISIS is also an idea.
*  ISIS wasn't destroyed.
*  But I would say that it wasn't simply degraded either.
*  In other words, maybe there's some point between degraded and destroyed that we need to take
*  more seriously.
*  Right after the attacks, there was a lot of global support.
*  There was also very terrible things said in protest on social media.
*  But there was a lot of global support.
*  Since I would say we've also seen true surging anti-Semitism all over the world.
*  I mean, there are stories about anti-Semitism on the Chinese Internet.
*  And there was the mob that was roaming the airport in Dagestan trying to find a rumored
*  flight from Tel Aviv.
*  And you just feel it, right?
*  I live in Brooklyn. You feel it here.
*  And I'm curious how that rising anti-Semitism right now is being experienced in Israel,
*  what it does to Israeli politics.
*  I mean, I see it acting very powerfully on just my own Jewish community here.
*  So I imagine it is not something.
*  And when I read the Israeli press, it is certainly not something that is being missed.
*  What role is that having now?
*  Israelis are very keenly following the outbreak of really what is global.
*  Anti-Semitism.
*  And because of social media, we've never experienced anti-Semitism to this extent.
*  I mean, we've experienced much deeper, obviously much deeper forms of anti-Semitism or lethal.
*  But there's something about the globalization of anti-Semitism that's new.
*  What this has done, I think, for my kids generation, I see it with my kids, is they always,
*  my kids always felt that I was a paranoid Jew, guilty as charged.
*  And they felt, and I was very proud of them for this.
*  They felt that they were free.
*  They were free of those traumas.
*  And I saw that as a tremendous success as an Israeli parent,
*  that I'd raised Jews who were psychologically free of that trauma.
*  And what I see with all three of them now is that it's back.
*  It's not back.
*  It's something they never had before.
*  And they're discovering vulnerability.
*  I have two kids now living abroad, and they're feeling this very intensely.
*  And their generation here, this is what I'm feeling certainly here,
*  is that for the first time, they really understand why this place matters.
*  And there's a new sobriety among Israelis.
*  And one of the things that moves me so much about what's happening to American Jews,
*  and certainly not all, but many, many more than I thought,
*  is how American Jews have realized the extent to which Israel matters to them.
*  And October 7th was a glimpse that we all had into what the end of a Jewish state would look like.
*  That's how it ends.
*  And suddenly there was this sense of panic.
*  What would happen to the Jewish people if we lost Israel?
*  And so there's an opportunity here.
*  I hate to use that word in connection to this time,
*  but this is a moment where we need to start fundamentally rethinking
*  the dysfunctional relationship between Israel and American Jewry.
*  We need to start taking American Jewish concerns, moral concerns, seriously.
*  We need to consider what does it mean, what is the impact of Israeli policies on diaspora security?
*  That should be an issue for us.
*  And in turn, diaspora Jews should be asking themselves a very hard question right now,
*  which is how did we allow ourselves to get to the point where we could imagine
*  that we were ready to give up on the gift of a Jewish state?
*  And so I think that both sides in this relationship have some really deep thinking to do.
*  Obviously, no one is in a position to do that now,
*  but this is a moment that I feel could be an historic turnaround,
*  finally, after 75 years, for American Jews and Israelis to start treating each other
*  as equal Jewish grownups who are both responsible for the future of the Jewish people.
*  I think that's a good place to end.
*  So this is always our final question.
*  What are three books that you would recommend to the audience?
*  The first is, I think, the best book ever written about Israel,
*  which is A Tale of Love and Darkness by Amos Oz, which is autobiographical,
*  but it's really the biography of the state as he experienced it growing up.
*  The second book, a book I love, by Mati Friedman, Who by Fire,
*  which tells the story of Leonard Cohen's tour of the front during the Yom Kippur War,
*  and anything that Mati Friedman writes, I recommend.
*  And finally, a book called The War of Return by Enat Wilf and Adi Schwartz,
*  which makes a very strong case for why the key to peace is confining the Palestinian
*  demand for refugee return to a Palestinian state.
*  And it lays out the history of the demand for the right of return, the legal aspects.
*  I think it's a very important book.
*  Yossi Klein Halevi, you have many great books, but one that I read in anticipation of this,
*  and that I would really recommend to people in this moment,
*  is Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor, which is excellent.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Well, thank you, Ezra. I really enjoyed talking to you.
