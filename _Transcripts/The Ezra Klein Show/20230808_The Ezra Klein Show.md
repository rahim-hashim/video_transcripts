# A Conservative on How His Party Has Changed Since 2016
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgMR9X2y6Hk)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey, it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave, but this week taking a turn at the mic is the great Jane Costin.
*  She's a Times opinion writer.
*  She has done years of work covering modern republicanism, conservatism, the populist
*  right and all of the schisms and fractures within.
*  It's a topic we've been trying to do more work on.
*  So I was grateful she was willing to come on the show and do some conversations around
*  it.
*  Enjoy.
*  In 2016, the Republican Party was the party of foreign policy interventionism, free trade
*  and cutting entitlements.
*  That's not the party of 2024.
*  In the last seven years, Donald Trump has completely transformed the Republican Party.
*  Or has he?
*  If so, why are so many of his competitors trying to sound like him on some issues, but
*  not, say, on healthcare?
*  I wanted to have a conversation that takes a step back from the primary and explores
*  how the party has changed since 2016, the different factions that have emerged in the
*  wake of Donald Trump, and what all of that could mean for the party's future.
*  And the person I wanted to have that conversation with is Ben Domenech.
*  Domenech is a longtime conservative writer, a former speechwriter in the second Bush administration,
*  and a founder of several right-leaning outlets, including Red State and The Federalist.
*  He's been around the right-wing block a few times.
*  But most importantly, he's someone on the right who I think best represents some of
*  those questions around what was wrong and right with the pre-Trump Republican Party,
*  how Trump changed things, and what a post-Trump GOP could look like.
*  As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at Ezra
*  Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Here's Ben Domenech.
*  Ben Domenech, welcome to the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Great to be with you.
*  You've said that Donald Trump broke open a policy consensus on the American right that
*  needed to be broken open.
*  What was that consensus, and why did it need to be broken open?
*  So I think that the consensus that he primarily broke was one that had a very top-down approach
*  to policy that was very much out of touch on the American right.
*  To an extent, this kind of goes back to the what's the matter with Kansas question.
*  Why do Republican voters who seem to have these different experiences in the middle
*  class in America, why are they voting for these politicians who seem to be more about
*  big corporations or multinational global interests or things along those lines?
*  Why aren't they voting for more populist economic policies?
*  And at the same time, why are they voting for people who basically have an open borders
*  approach to immigration or a particularly neoconservative focus to foreign policy when
*  those are things that basically, with rare exceptions, notably in the immediate aftermath
*  of 9-11 or things like that, those are not typically the strains of the right.
*  They tend to be very pro-military but tend to be reluctant about deployment of actual
*  Americans overseas.
*  They're generally opposed to Wilsonian do-gooder foreign policy in a lot of different ways.
*  Why does this happen?
*  And that really depends on a consensus, a post-Cold War consensus advocated for by a
*  lot of people that was not particularly representative of what your average Republican voter wanted.
*  And I think that in breaking open that consensus, Trump performed a valuable act.
*  The problem is, of course, that all that he really does is break those consensus.
*  He doesn't offer really a coherent alternative, I think, in terms of his approach to governance
*  because everything about him is this kind of animal motivation in different directions.
*  You've written on this old consensus, and let's call that boomer Republicanism.
*  You wrote that boomer Republicanism had its day and it gave us George W. Bush and Donald
*  Trump.
*  First and foremost, between those two people are three terms in the White House.
*  Boomer Republicanism won.
*  You go from the Republican Revolution in 1994, you got the Republicans the control of Congress
*  for the first time since 1952 and made my parents very mad.
*  Pretty much from 1994 to 2006, you have unprecedented wins on every level of government, not just
*  at the federal level, but you have wins in state houses, you have wins in the local level.
*  The American South basically becomes a Republican stronghold.
*  Florida, that will change later.
*  There are going to be a couple of states where they're going to have Democratic wins, but
*  those Democrats are probably more right leaning because there used to be right leaning Democrats
*  and left leaning Republicans.
*  This used to be a thing that we all had.
*  It happened.
*  I was there.
*  So Republicans, they were winning.
*  And then Obama won.
*  And then again, Republicans won again in 2010.
*  Republicans won again in 2014.
*  So why did that consensus need to be broken if it worked?
*  Well first off, I would say I think that the 2000 election is one of those interesting
*  moments where you have this very narrow George W. Bush victory that only happens because
*  of the system that we have.
*  Yet you look back at those two people and you see how much the parties have changed
*  since.
*  You made reference to the presence of conservative Democrats, really all the way up through the
*  exit of Bart Stupak and the handful of people who forced Obamacare to be different on abortion
*  issues than some people wanted.
*  That was a very real presence within the Democratic coalition.
*  Liberal Republicans held out a little bit longer.
*  I would say that this is the end with Charlie Baker exiting, Larry Hogan exiting, that
*  kind of thing.
*  But the thing that I think is interesting about that is that those elections, I think,
*  happened for a lot of different reasons.
*  You look at the 2004 election in the context of the post-911 war effort era.
*  It was just a real uphill battle for John Kerry.
*  It would have been, I think, very tough for him to pull off a victory in that timeline.
*  But then you saw the country, and I think including a large portion of Republicans,
*  sour on the war effort.
*  That led to the 2006 Democratic uprising.
*  Unfortunately, a couple of things happened in the space of the 2008 to 2016 period that
*  prevented any kind of reconsideration of those policy points of view.
*  Here's the way I would put it.
*  In John McCain, you have someone who gets the nomination based on his support of what
*  was at the time a successful policy, namely the surge.
*  But the thing that I think really happened is because McCain was not associated with
*  the Bush administration, clearly someone who had worked at odds with them in many cases,
*  and then because Mitt Romney was not associated with them, and then because in 2016 you had
*  gone through this kind of four-year period where a lot of people had shifted on foreign
*  policy.
*  There were a lot of people who would say that they were always against the war, but even
*  if they weren't, a lot of people said, you know, we needed to have more humility about
*  this.
*  And they were tired of the war efforts overseas.
*  And they had seen the experience in their own communities of people coming home.
*  When Jeb Bush started to run and he didn't have really an answer on Iraq, to me that
*  was just such an eye-opening thing because the consensus was sort of, you know, Republicans,
*  therefore strong American foreign policy overseas, quote unquote, which effectively from the
*  perspective of Washington means lots of military bases, a big footprint, et cetera.
*  And they really had never run into the idea that there were a lot of people, including
*  people within the Republican coalition, who were opposed to that.
*  They thought of them as being the Ron Paul freaks and not people who were essentially,
*  you know, a third of the coalition.
*  I think the other thing is Bush ran on being, you know, an education president.
*  The backlash to No Child Left Behind is something that I think it's underrated as an issue.
*  There's a lot of people within the Tea Party movement in particular who were strong critics
*  of that.
*  They didn't trust what it did in terms of federalizing of a lot of different educational
*  systems.
*  They viewed it with a lot of suspicion and they didn't trust it.
*  And I think that one of the things that happened because of that is there's just this kind
*  of gap in terms of what people are saying in their communities and what the Republican
*  bullet points, their standard bullet points are.
*  And I think you see a lot of that, frankly, in this moment within how out of touch someone
*  like Mike Pence seems with the Times.
*  It's not just about January 6th for Republican voters.
*  He sounds like someone who basically hasn't changed since he was a member of Congress,
*  you know, within the Freedom Caucus, you know, viewed as like a bomb thrower, viewed as being
*  someone who would give leadership fits.
*  Back in the day, that is a bit revisionist.
*  He's way too polite to give anybody fits.
*  But it's one of these things where that type of conservatism was viewed as extreme when
*  there was a much bigger swath of people who were well to the right of that and who felt
*  like their views were not being heard and found a vehicle for it in 2016 that surprised
*  a lot of us.
*  So you've written that the arrival of the Trumpian moment in 2016 appeared to be a golden
*  opportunity to dissatisfied conservatives.
*  Basically, if you didn't like what was going on, you hoped that the post Trump GOP could
*  become the vehicle for, as you write, whatever it was you'd always wanted.
*  And, you know, I wrote about this in 2017 for National Review, in which I argued that
*  Trump was like a tabula rasa upon which you could project your greatest dreams or your
*  biggest fears.
*  He could be a best friend to evangelicals, or he would love LGBT people, or he was going
*  to be a dove, or he was going to bomb the shit out of everybody, or he was going to
*  like launch the Fourth Reich, whatever it was, and he would just tell you yes and.
*  So where were you in 2016?
*  What I was disappointed by in 2016 is that, you know, my friend Tim Carney and I, we did
*  a debate with Brett Stevens and with Jennifer Rubin for then Intelligence Squared, the debate
*  program in New York City after Trump had won the nomination.
*  And we won a debate based on the argument that you should blame the elites for the rise
*  of Trump.
*  And we were in the for and they were in the against.
*  The reason that we won that is because we advanced an argument, one which I still believe
*  that basically says the political elite in this country got way too far out of touch
*  and frankly had been credentialed to a point where they were no longer responsive or in
*  touch with the priorities of the people on a number of different fronts.
*  And that allowed someone like Trump to come along and seize hold of those dreams that
*  you're talking about, those nostalgic dreams that Yvon Levin has written about in his books
*  and others have noted as well.
*  This sort of boomer nostalgia for a country that to a certain degree existed, but also
*  had a lot of defects to it that they don't seem to remember at all.
*  You know, they look back on it with these kind of rose colored glasses.
*  The thing that I really was about at that point was I hoped that we would have a generational
*  shift.
*  I hope that one of the younger members, really just someone who was no longer in that boomer
*  category emerge as a leader.
*  I wasn't a particular fan of Marco Rubio, but I just thought that any of these guys
*  really who has a younger set of priorities is more in touch with people who will still
*  be around 30 and 40 years from now, as opposed to being yet one more president who was born
*  in 1946, keeping in mind that we've now had three.
*  That was something that really was a priority for me.
*  I hoped that it would be someone who could channel this populism in a healthy way, because
*  I think there's unhealthy and healthy versions of populism.
*  But that was really my priority.
*  I mean, I don't as a general rule, I don't endorse in the last Republican that I voted
*  for for president was John McCain.
*  So I've not I've not been in that.
*  I'm more in the analysis lane of things.
*  I mean, I'm always curious about the argument about how Trump represented a pushback against
*  elites, one on the micro level, because Trump to me is an elite doing kind of like a weird
*  impersonation of what he thinks non elites would be like.
*  I think that the conversation he had, I think it was 2016 with Chris Matthews, in which
*  she's asked about abortion.
*  He's like, yeah, women who have abortions should be punished, which is exactly what
*  you would think social conservatives would want if you have never met social conservatives
*  or haven't really thought about it that much.
*  And then you get Susan B. Anthony having to come out being like, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
*  whoa.
*  It's the Mitt Romney severe conservatism thing, but on a much bigger level.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  This is what you want me to say.
*  Yeah, it's performed.
*  It's performed.
*  But we see that Trump and people who have attempted to interpret Trump as them in their
*  own way, which we'll get to that because I'm always interested in what that actually means.
*  They've lost a lot.
*  He lost the popular vote in 2016, a thing that did take place.
*  And you know, about 75,000 votes in three states change this entire conversation in
*  fascinating way.
*  Republicans get destroyed in the 2018 midterms.
*  He lost the 2020 election.
*  Republicans underperformed in 2022.
*  Any election that becomes about him, people are like, absolutely not.
*  He is a voice for people who want to challenge elites.
*  But then a lot of people really, really hate him.
*  How do you think that works?
*  Well I think they hate him because of who he is.
*  For instance, a good example of this I think would be to say, you know, when it comes to
*  immigration policy or something like that, is there a difference between Donald Trump
*  and Kevin McCarthy?
*  How different are the policies that he has toward trade?
*  At the same time, they're not saying that every country in the world other than America
*  is a shithole country, you know, essentially, particularly ones that have lots of people
*  who are differently colored than him.
*  The thing that I think is true here is that a lot of this kind of Trumpism without Trump idea
*  is based on the assumption that a different perspective on things was really needed in
*  terms of the way that Republicans responded to their base.
*  And I do believe that that's true.
*  I think that you've seen the shift that's happened and the language that Republicans,
*  even Republicans who've been around for a long time, have used on a lot of these issues
*  has shifted in priorities.
*  I think the biggest sort of aspect of this that's apparent is Republicans are no longer
*  automatically assuming that big business is their friend, or that they should defend that
*  automatically or that those priorities line up with what their voters want.
*  But the flip side of that is this sort of question of how much of Trump's appeal is
*  the non-policy portion of what he does.
*  And I think that that is both something that has enormous support on the American right
*  and enormous hatred from the independent and the Democratic voter in a way that we
*  haven't seen historically.
*  And I do mean hatred because he says things that drive people crazy.
*  He says things that are both racist and infuriating and insulting in ways that people,
*  I think, properly respond to as just being anathema.
*  They don't want it.
*  And the thing to me that I think coming out of 2022 and sort of seeing, OK, this is the
*  first election where he's not effectively on the ballot because even though that midterm was a
*  midterm, it was about Trump.
*  In 2022, Democrats turn it into a conversation successfully about January 6th and about
*  anti-democratic small-d Republicans, about these wackadoo folks who are denying elections and the
*  like.
*  In the aftermath of those elections, virtually none of those people actually denied them except
*  for the people in the state of Arizona.
*  And I think that that sort of proved to a certain point that the lack of normalcy, the lack of
*  stability among these politicians was something that really damaged them.
*  They took an election that should have been about, from the Republican perspective, about crime rise
*  in major cities, about inflation, about pocketbook issues, kitchen table issues, about education and
*  the like.
*  And they turned it into an election that was about these people are going to seize your
*  government and your democracy away from you, and you need to guard against that.
*  And they did so successfully, in part because a lot of Democrat money went to helping nominate a
*  lot of crazy people in primaries, and then a lot of crazy people just got nominated on their own.
*  At the end of the day, what that proves is that people don't like crazy in their politics.
*  Donald Trump got lucky in 2016 by running against someone who turned out to be way more unpopular
*  than I think anybody really assessed.
*  And by shooting the moon in terms of the Electoral College, that's a very difficult thing to do.
*  The math and the map are even harder for him in 2024.
*  But I think the answer I would give you is the crazy and put just sort of everything under that.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK-KLEIN So I have a theory.
*  I'm going to lay it out for you, which is that Republicans saw what Trump did.
*  And we're like, we don't trust or like this person, but he can be a vehicle for what we want to do
*  if we just keep him happy.
*  But we are absolutely terrified of the fact that his voters have indicated that all of our
*  conservative priorities, everything that we've run up the flagpole with Heritage Foundation or
*  Club for Growth, they don't care about any of that.
*  And I would argue in some ways that with Governor Ron DeSantis, they have someone who I think they
*  believe can thread the needle of being both Trumpian, not Trumpian in policy, not he's not
*  moderate on entitlement reform.
*  If you go back to his stint in Congress, you know, this is someone who said we should embrace
*  then Speaker Paul Ryan's plans on cutting social security and cutting entitlements, which Trump now
*  is going after him for.
*  But this is someone who is a actual severe conservative, but he is Trumpian in that he is
*  willing to be combative all the time on everything.
*  Why do you think that's how this has worked?
*  Do you think the establishment is still afraid of like moderation on actual policy?
*  Because that's a different thing.
*  You can be, I think what a lot of Republicans seem to want is they want like national review
*  conservatism policy, but then Breitbart conservatism attitude.
*  I'm going to disagree with you a bit.
*  And let me see if I can address all the different things you brought up there, because I think I
*  understand what you're saying.
*  I would first say that true fiscal conservatism has no home in Washington.
*  I think it was tried.
*  I mean, I think you had, you know, in terms of Paul Ryan's entitlement programs, which were voted
*  for overwhelmingly by Republicans, the vast majority of whom were reelected and very few of
*  whom really suffered politically for it.
*  I think that that was, you know, an attempt to try to have reform of entitlements that was built
*  along the idea that people are living a lot longer than they used to and that we can't
*  offer people the same guarantees that we did back in the late sixties.
*  But I think that one of the things that is true today is that if you went looking for fiscal
*  conservatism, you would find that in the Senate, you can count them on one hand.
*  And in the House, they are primarily the people who are on Kevin McCarthy's right, who are
*  lobbing grenades at him.
*  I mean, Chip Roy is one of the most fiscally conservative members of the Congress.
*  So is Thomas Massey.
*  And they are pretty lonely in there in terms of wanting to spend far less money and in opposing,
*  obviously, for instance, this most recent debt deal as much as they could.
*  Heritage was with them on that point, which supports your argument.
*  But I think that fiscal conservatism post the Bush years got a lot of lip service from
*  Republicans.
*  It got a handful of Paul Ryan things that he got through.
*  And that was really it.
*  These are two parties arguing about, you know, my friend Michael Malice talks about this as
*  conservatism being left governing a speed limit.
*  And I think that that, you know, really is true of a lot of these fiscal matters.
*  To your point about wanting not that different economic policy, but with that different flavor,
*  I think that's a big part of the challenge for someone like DeSantis.
*  Because one thing that Trump has done so far already is kind of go after him for going after
*  Disney and doing some of the other things that he's done as being anti-Republican.
*  That sounds like a typical Republican critique.
*  It sounds like something that Mitch McConnell would agree with.
*  And then at the same time, I think that you see within sort of DeSantis' approach, about a year
*  ago, he did this thing.
*  He presented this permanent tax exemption, sales tax exemption for all these different things
*  related to childbirth.
*  So that's diapers, cribs, strollers, all these other things that he did a big photo op, but it
*  was a major tax cut in Florida for that.
*  That's kind of more of a traditional Republican kind of issue.
*  But that's not the reason that people get excited about him, or that's not what he's known for on a
*  national level.
*  It's what I liked about him.
*  It's like the idea that we should make having kids a lot cheaper and easier to do.
*  And I'm one of the people who thinks that childbirth in America should be essentially free and that we
*  have a big problem when it comes to childbirth in America, given the difference in terms of
*  survival rates, both for mothers and children.
*  But that's a completely different argument.
*  But the thing that I think is sort of interesting about that is that is not the thing that gets you
*  a million hits.
*  What gets you a million hits is when you are yelling at a protester or a member of the media
*  who's asked you a question that is at odds with your perspective and the perspective of your
*  voters.
*  And that's something that, from my perspective, has carried through since 94.
*  It's really almost, I mean, Steve Kornacki did this phenomenal series.
*  I encourage people to check it out that essentially adapts a portion of one of his books and
*  is on the Gingrich Revolution.
*  But what you see with his rise is this different use of media and this confrontational attitude
*  towards media that had not historically been an element of Republican politics and then became
*  one and carried through even to his 2012 run, you know, that incident in South Carolina that
*  ultimately led to him winning that primary where he is taking on CNN, you know, sort of direct.
*  It's something that I think now stirs emotions and it, you know, hits that lizard brain part of
*  Republican voters or some Republican voters say, yeah, yeah, hit back, you know, hit back.
*  From my perspective, it's like, okay, well, but hit back intelligently, embrace the argument.
*  Don't just say you're another one of these corrupt media journalists.
*  Why are you asking me this question?
*  I think debating the question is very important and doing so in a way that isn't just kind of the Ted
*  Cruz debate school way, but of one that's designed to convince the people watching,
*  not the person necessarily that you're arguing with, convince the people watching that you
*  actually have a point and that they might actually be able to vote for a Republican.
*  I just think that's smart politics.
*  It's something that, you know, Bill Clinton was incredibly good at.
*  And really ever since he was around, we haven't really seen that type of skill.
*  Right. Because I think that, you know, just fighting with journalists,
*  I think about it in terms of pro wrestling.
*  Like it's cheap heat.
*  Yes.
*  It's the same thing as like going out in 1989 and waving and a rocky flag and talking about
*  how great Saddam Hussein is at a wrestling event in Texas.
*  Like everybody's going to boo.
*  You're the heel.
*  This is easy.
*  Last month, Tucker Carlson interviewed six presidential candidates at the Iowa's Family
*  Leader Summit.
*  So you had Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, Asa Hutchinson, Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Vivek
*  Ramaswamy, and notably Donald Trump did not attend.
*  You talked about in a piece that back in 2015, the Iowa Family Leader event was a
*  game changer because Donald Trump could insult John McCain's status as a prisoner of war
*  and get away with it.
*  And people would be like, oh, that's interesting.
*  And this time Donald Trump didn't even show up and didn't seem to need to.
*  Can you tell me a little bit about that?
*  So I'm not sure that Donald Trump wanted to share a stage with Tucker.
*  No.
*  In part because I think Tucker would ask him tougher questions than people might expect,
*  but also because Tucker is smarter and more appealing and more charismatic.
*  So, you know, you never really want to run the danger that they end up liking him more
*  than they like you.
*  Why isn't this guy running?
*  So the thing that is bizarre about that family leader event for a number of reasons is it used
*  to be kind of a space where you had to check the Iowa bona fides.
*  You had to go in there and say things that appealed to these pastors, appealed to their
*  Christian and social conservative priorities.
*  And if you look back historically, Bob Vander Plaatsch, who runs this, and he's an often
*  failed gubernatorial candidate, but he's viewed as a kingmaker because he, the person he endorses
*  wins all the time.
*  Go back to Mike Huckabee upsetting Mitt Romney in 2008, which sort of let the air out of that
*  sort of situation.
*  One of the things that stuck out to me about that event, other than the fact that Tucker
*  was more interested, I think, in doing kind of a version of his show interrogations than
*  anything else, it was weird to me that he didn't ask Nikki Haley about Ukraine because she seemed
*  to be the one person I would definitely want to know what she thinks about it, given her foreign
*  policy background.
*  But I also felt like this is how much the populist strain of the party now feels that it includes
*  the overwhelming majority of evangelicals and Christians within the party.
*  There are certainly people who are outside of that, but I think that you basically define that
*  total in the addition of Mike Pence and Tim Scott, and that's basically it.
*  And so that means 10, 12% of the party that just is still so put off by Donald Trump.
*  And I would guess skews more female than sort of the rest of it.
*  I found that to be an interesting event, but it's also one of these things where I think that the
*  reason that Trump really didn't show up other than that dynamic is that he knows pretty well
*  that Iowa didn't treat him that great last time around that Ted Cruz was able to pull off the
*  upset.
*  And I think there is some part of Trump that is almost willing to concede Iowa, not to say
*  that he doesn't want to win it.
*  He doesn't want to win it, but he kind of knows, hey, I won the nomination last time without Iowa.
*  Ron DeSantis has built his entire campaign on winning in Iowa.
*  He hired Jeff Rowe, who won in Iowa last time.
*  He's hired all these people.
*  He's clearly palling around the state with Kim Reynolds, the governor, popular governor,
*  trying to get an endorsement.
*  And I think that Trump is kind of looking at this map, or at least I assume that his people are
*  looking at this map and saying, hey, look, sir, you actually don't need Iowa.
*  Iowa is not picking the president for quite some time.
*  And I think that part of that could have been the element of it.
*  Nicole Soule So there are two things happening here.
*  You have a host of candidates who are all saying like, it's time to move past Trump.
*  They cannot say that Trump is bad.
*  Unless you're Chris Christie, who does not care.
*  But you kind of have to say that Trump is great.
*  But like, you know, we need somebody else.
*  We need somebody to get us over the hump, so to speak.
*  But what would it take even arguing like, oh, he loses, like, doesn't work?
*  Or saying like, here's Ron DeSantis, who is like Trump, but he's done all the stuff.
*  You know, he has it.
*  It doesn't work.
*  So what would?
*  Pete Slauson So as Ric Flair, you know, would know to be the man, you have to beat the man.
*  DeSantis' theory of the case was obviously that I'm going to be Trump without the COVID mistakes.
*  And I'm going to hammer him on that aspect of it.
*  You know, he's really gone after him.
*  Whenever he sort of teed up something from Trump criticizing him, he'll go and run through the
*  litany of, you know, he was the one giving awards to Anthony Fauci.
*  He's the one who shut down the economy.
*  He still won't criticize him personally, but he'll do all that stuff.
*  And he'll even say, I'm not going to criticize him personally.
*  I hate when people read the instructions off the side of the legal pad.
*  I mean, you know, going back to the H.W. Bush, you know, message I care moment.
*  When it comes to beating Trump, the thing that you would, I think, really have to do
*  is to stand on a stage across from him and beat him in debates.
*  And I think that that is something that we haven't seen any Republican capable of doing.
*  People haven't known how to challenge him.
*  They haven't known how to take him on.
*  And one of the things to keep in mind, I think, is sometimes you just run into a buzzsaw.
*  And whether that was Rubio and Christie in 2016, whether it was Kamala and Tulsi in 2020,
*  sometimes someone comes along who just has your number and they may not even elevate themselves,
*  but they can take you down a couple of notches.
*  But I also think that Trump starts with such a lead that it's hard to see that happening at
*  this point. I think it's very likely that he ends up being the nominee.
*  And I think it would take him losing and losing significantly, losing by more than he lost last
*  time in order for people to turn away from him.
*  The other thing that I think is one aspect of this that we should respect or at least acknowledge
*  politicians who are great at running for office, not necessarily, you know, whether they're great
*  in office or not, they do the thing for themselves.
*  They don't wait around for other people to do the thing for them.
*  It's something that I think is very true, for instance, of a number of different people
*  looking back and sort of saying, you know, Barack Obama didn't wait around for other people to help
*  him beat Hillary. He beat Hillary. And when it came time for the Trump phenomenon to happen in 2016,
*  there were a lot of people waiting around for someone else to take him down.
*  I need someone else to hit him because I'm not going to hit him and I'm not going to hit Ben
*  Carson. And so I just need to concentrate my fire on this other person who I view as being in my
*  lane. I think you actually, you know, you have to take on the candidate themselves and win.
*  I still haven't seen that from anybody in this field. And when it comes to someone like Christie,
*  I just don't think he's actually running to be president. This is just a vengeance campaign,
*  which is fine. It'll be entertaining.
*  What would you most like to see from a post Trump GOP?
*  What I would most like to see is a reworking of what an America first
*  economic and foreign policy looks like. And by that, I mean a holistic kind of approach that says,
*  what do we want America to look like 10, 20 years from now? Well, we want people to be having
*  more kids. We don't want to have a situation where people are so depressed about the future
*  that they don't have any optimism about that, that their family formation is so expensive
*  and it's so expensive for them to get what they want out of things. Education, the quality ones
*  are so expensive. They don't think they can afford it. They're delaying family formation.
*  And frankly, as we look across societies across the world, that's a sign of, you know, your
*  economy and everything else entering into a downturn. I think we have to care about the
*  American family. And then I think we have to care about American foreign policy in a way that really
*  prioritizes what the most important things are. From my perspective, that is hemming in and making
*  it clear to a rising but very risk involved Chinese leadership that they cannot encroach
*  within the Pacific in ways that would essentially allow them to become the leader of the world in
*  so many different respects to prevent America from being able to chart its own path and to
*  assist our allies. And also, you know, frankly, to prevent us from being able to make it clear
*  that if you mess around in violent and military ways towards other nations like Taiwan, there's
*  going to be ramifications for you. You know, in addition to that, as American first foreign policy
*  focus is, I think we have to have that kind of attitude when it comes to recognizing how much
*  Mexico has become a failed state, particularly in the cartel dominance that we see in parts of the
*  country and figuring out what needs to be done to address that problem, as opposed to just operating
*  under this mythology that we can just throw a bunch of walls up and that we that will be the
*  difference targets both I think the negative effects of fentanyl on all our communities,
*  but also I think the very real criminal human trafficking element, which is disrupting cities,
*  not just, you know, in the southwest, but across America. So to me, it's kind of like making these
*  points, all of those overlap with certain concerns that Trump raised. And I would say, are the more
*  consistent aspects of him over his lifetime? You know, he's been on every position on every different
*  front, but he's been a little more consistent on those. Let's make those serious as opposed to just
*  lip service. So that is what you would like to see. Do you think that that is what American voters
*  would want to see? Because yes, American voters, American GOP primary voters, I think there was
*  some polling that came out saying like, we want to hear more about the economy. I think 51% wanted
*  to hear more about the economy. Foreign policy to my eternal chagrin is never something people
*  generally want to vote about. If you can tie it back to a domestic issue, people will be interested
*  in, but like your policy ideas, how do you think like voters writ large think about this? Because
*  sometimes when I have conversations with people about what they want to see from their parties,
*  it's sort of like how some Democrats and some folks in the left will always talk about how like,
*  but when you know, when we pull it Medicare for all does so well. And then you like look at the
*  wording of the polling and you're like, I don't think that's quite how this is working. So is
*  this the kind of, you know, this might be what you want, but is this, do you think that this is what
*  voters want? So I'll push back with you slightly only on this front. This is from a Echelon Insights
*  poll recently. Patrick Rafini, who's the head over there along with Kristen Solis Anderson,
*  was sharing this recently in the context of an argument with David Sacks, who's been big on the
*  kind of Republican voters want to pull out of Ukraine has been kind of his drumbeat. There's
*  not polling data supporting that. And multiples of the top 10 on this mentioned China, China
*  security threats, China economic competition. And just by anecdotal experience, when I go to
*  obviously primarily conservative audiences that I've spoken to, I hear very little about Ukraine.
*  And in fact, the last two times I've gotten questions about Ukraine, it's been about,
*  are we spending too much in Ukraine to keep us from being able to balance against China?
*  So I think that foreign policy as a general bucket, you're right. China specifically,
*  I think people are much more aware of it. And I think that they're aware of it in part because
*  there's just been so much blatant behavior. And then they sent a frickin balloon.
*  I feel like once you give something imagery, like once you can actually see the thing, the boxes
*  in Mar-a-Lago, like once you got that image, it's like you can't unsee that image. And it's one of
*  these things where that imagery, I think, made people just, it made them, especially for the
*  boomer sort of Sputnik kids, it made them feel very unnerved. Yeah. I think that on the point
*  also about the economy is that in general, I have found that when you talk to people about how the
*  economy functions, there's this general sense that like their personal economy is good, but the economy
*  is bad. And voting on that, that is how people actually vote. If I were in charge of everything,
*  that's not how people would vote. Well, one thing I think comes into that is actually something that
*  happened in 2016. There was some interesting research done after that about the Trump voter,
*  not being someone who had personally experienced anything associated with like the deaths of
*  despair. Right, right. It was in their community. It wasn't them. It wasn't them. And so that's why
*  a lot of, when there was kind of the pushback, first it was like, ah, the Trump voter is sad.
*  Yes. But then it was like the pushback was like, ah, they're making $75,000 a year. Exactly. They're
*  fine. But then it's sort of the situation where it's like, nobody broke into my office and nobody
*  broke into my shop, but they broke into the shop that's next to my barber that I see every week.
*  And it's one of these things where that flows into the way people think about things. It's
*  the shoplifting trend. The shoplifting trend is something that is clearly a problem in America.
*  There's a lot of evidence for that. It's not just a problem in San Francisco or something like that.
*  It's not just a leftist city sort of thing. It is a problem. How many people are actually going to
*  get shoplifted? Not that many. But if the place that you frequent, if you change the CVS that you
*  go to or the Walgreens that you go to or the Duane Reed that you go to, because that one you know is
*  more likely to have somebody running out of it when you go in carrying a bunch of stuff, that affects
*  the way that you think about the way things are going in your community. And I think that that
*  element is very true within the economy as well.
*  There are so many different strains within the conservative movement.
*  Can you briefly describe what Barstool conservatism is?
*  So it's a term that was used because of its association with Dave Portnoy and Barstool
*  Sports, the very successful online personality driven publication has a ton of podcasts,
*  including ones that I listen to that are off the wall and funny and entertaining.
*  But it came to be something that was associated with the rise of Donald Trump, because a lot of
*  them were saying very positive things about him. They were entertained by him. But then when COVID
*  really hit, it took off in a much bigger way. And so Barstool conservatism became kind of this
*  stand in term for a kind of libertine ish conservatism that really was about being left alone.
*  But also, I would argue kind of an ethos of sex is good. Me having sex is awesome.
*  Anyone telling me what to do in any way is bad, and they should stop doing that. But it's something
*  that we've talked a little bit about of like, these different strains working together,
*  and they found common cause I think during COVID. COVID became a moment in which for many people on
*  the right, this was the ultimate nanny state telling people what to do. People were changing
*  their Twitter user bios to do not comply. And then later they were like, actually, we would like you
*  to comply with this other stuff. But even describing the Barstool conservatives as conservative
*  is a weird thing to do. And you saw that a little bit after Dobbs. Dave Portnoy himself was like,
*  emergency press conference, this is terrible. How dare we tell women what to do with their bodies?
*  And you saw a bunch of people on the right being like, wait, what? No, it made sense. But what do
*  you think of these divides, these strains? What does this relationship mean?
*  So the dynamic that you're identifying is real. There is an anti-nanny statism that can overlap
*  from both a coherent conservatism, and then just a meandering populism, which is essentially what
*  I think the Barstool element of it is. We want to be able to gamble, porn is good, it's not bad.
*  We want people to have fun, drink high noon, gamble more. We want them to be entertained by
*  the people who we have on our programs who are both big winners and big losers,
*  buy cheap t-shirts, and just keep the ethos rolling. And where that interacts with politics,
*  it really is kind of a celebrification. Obviously, Portnoy got to do a long interview
*  with Donald Trump. And historically, you can see kind of the appeal to that. It's one of these
*  things that is basically for people who don't consume politics on a regular basis. It's when
*  something goes viral that interacts with the political world where they interject. Sam Talent,
*  a very talented comedian from Colorado, described the pandemic as being a point where some people
*  were getting very, very authoritarian about the mass and distancing and narking on people.
*  And then everybody else viewed their act of patriotism as saying, if I can't go to Buffalo
*  Wild Wings, then I'm going to blow up a post office, which I think is very much sort of an
*  accurate description of the two poles. What I think of as being a good attribute of barstool
*  conservatism is essentially that it overlaps with the Gazdan flag kind of just leave us alone
*  coalition, whether that be going after menthol cigarettes or vaping or any of these things that
*  are kind of nanny state government stuff that they rebel against. I think that that's good.
*  It's also something that historically is very American. Barstool conservatives are the types
*  of people who would have dressed up as Native Americans and thrown tea in Boston Harbor.
*  Portnoy is that guy. He's the Sam Adams type of crazy man who is kind of on the extreme of that.
*  Then there's the John Adams conservatism, which is, I need to go in and defend the British soldiers
*  in order to show that we have equal justice here in America and we're not just some backwards
*  colony that's going to not be able to govern ourselves. Those two forces overlap on some
*  things, but they are at direct odds on others. How that is adjudicated, I think, requires those
*  sides to talk to each other because Matt Walsh may be able to advocate for, I think, and even
*  make a strong case that pornography is bad. It's done bad things to society. It does bad things to
*  men. It does bad things to women. That kind of thing. He can make that argument, but he's not
*  going to ban it any more than he's going to ban VPNs or something like that. Instead, I would argue
*  he should work culturally to make more content that makes people feel a little bit more hesitant
*  about consuming OnlyFans or something like that. Makes them give pause to going down that road if
*  he thinks that's an argument that he can win. We're talking about elder millennials and
*  younger Xers here. We're not talking about super young folks, but they are this next generation of
*  people who are going to be around for presumably a while and influencing what the right thinks,
*  presumably for a while. When you're talking about those factions, what is interesting about them is
*  how little they are represented in the diaspora of conservative organizations. There's a ton of
*  little groups that are part of this kind of, we need to use the power of the state for the common
*  good. Those groups tend to be extremely small. There's a lot of overlap in the benefactors.
*  They also overlap with media organizations in terms of the non-profit backing that they get.
*  Then you have these big older entities of conservatism, Inc., which are back to
*  a much, much larger degree. You're talking about entities like the Heritage Foundation,
*  Cato Institute, and AEI that were for quite a long while the big three in Washington,
*  viewed as enormously important, and yet went through periods of decline for a number of
*  different reasons. What you really have here, I think, is a bunch of people who have made their
*  different little think tanks and made their different little journals and are all arguing
*  with each other or giving each other awards, but haven't really coalesced into something that
*  seems to have some real staying power to it and don't have a strong level of representation on
*  Capitol Hill to really be able to maybe move the ball in the ways that they thought they would be
*  able to. I think it's going to take some time to see how that develops.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK You wrote a piece that was in praise of the single cat lady.
*  You argue, in recent years, Republican candidates and media figures have become
*  increasingly critical of one portion of the population. That is single women. You see this
*  continuing. You see that I read a piece, I think, two weeks ago in which it was argued that single
*  white women were the biggest enemy to the American right in the world. Not like China or even
*  something like amorphous. It was like single women. They are it. They are the problem.
*  You wrote that it's—
*  The new al-Qaeda.
*  Right. Exactly. Exactly. It's honestly a bizarre approach to people who purportedly want to be
*  successful at politics. But you do see repeatedly this idea that the bro-iest people in the world,
*  and I do not mean bro-y in the like my beloved bros with whom I discuss football and the Second
*  World War and action movies. I mean the people who think Andrew Tate is great and that feminism
*  is why women are ugly now. And you reference this in the piece of like Representative Matt
*  Gates talking about like women who are protesting outside the Supreme Court are just so sad and
*  lonely. Why would they even need abortions? Because no one wants to have sex with them.
*  They're alone with their cats. One, this goes to this idea, you know, talking about wanting to
*  seem relatable or normal, which I'm like, no, that's not relatable or normal. But also like
*  women have been defecting, specifically single women, women have been defecting from the
*  Republican Party for like 15 years now. And there seems to be this ethos among some Republicans
*  that's like, fine, go, get out of here. We hate you. Why? Well, and one thing that I would
*  contrast that to is, you know, imagine if they had that attitude towards black male voters
*  or something like that. Republicans love the idea. They're enthused about the idea of like,
*  if we can just win one or two more percentage points of black male voters, it makes us
*  competitive in all these different districts. They'll say this publicly, of course. Yeah.
*  It's wild if you look at the voting percentages between like black men, Hispanic men, again,
*  like there were rising numbers of people who voted for Trump. And I think that the polling
*  showed that the number of black women who voted for Trump in Pennsylvania, I think you could put
*  them in this room, which is not a big one. So my my response to that is always like,
*  okay, well, first off, dream a little bigger. But second off, why have this attitude towards
*  single women in particular, that just says, basically, we're just going to write you off,
*  we're not interested in your vote. In part, because I think that you need to be able to make
*  your argument that the world that you envision, and the cities that you envision, in particular,
*  because so many single women in particular are drawn to cities, and to that kind of environment,
*  that that would be better for them than the current situation. It's as simple as sort of saying,
*  if you were Republican, you know, running in some Democrats wrong hold, let's just take Washington,
*  DC. And you didn't try to make your case to single women by saying, I want you to feel safer walking
*  home at night than you do right now under Mayor Bowser. And that's going to be my top priority.
*  That would be crazy, you know, and yet that's the way that people approach it on a sort of national
*  or federal level, is they feel like they don't even have to make that appeal. And I think that,
*  you know, look, you're always going to get the same demographics when it comes to reliable
*  Republican voters. But I just think that this blaming of single cat ladies isn't just
*  politically wrong. But I think it's at odds with what we should do just towards a group of people.
*  I have many, many single female friends who many of whom own cats, many of whom would like to be
*  married, many of whom would like to have kids, many of whom find city living to be far too
*  expensive, far too dangerous. They sort of throw their hands up after a couple of years and they
*  move out into the suburbs or something like that. Many of them are in a point in life where just by
*  dint of bad fortune or financial crisis or something like that, you know, they went through a period
*  where they never found a guy who seemed marriageable. Or some of them are sort of past that point. And,
*  you know, whether they wanted it or not. I don't think that's something to blame them for when it
*  comes to the policy side of things. I think instead, you know, you should try to meet them
*  where they are. And even if you're going to, you're not going to agree with them on every policy. Sure,
*  it's going to be harder to win the vote of a single mom, you know, in the American experience
*  than it is to win the vote of those sort of Republican, comfortable Republican demographics.
*  But I think you should try. And I think that you shouldn't view them as being a form of the
*  electorate that you should demonize in the way that so many different people within, I think,
*  the right of center sphere tend to demonize them. It's almost like you're taking glee at them living
*  lives that are less happy than they would have been if they had followed your own prescription,
*  but you don't know that that's true. And, you know, I think that in the American experience,
*  we should be all about helping Americans of all stripes, you know, pursue happiness as opposed to
*  saying, haha, look at you, you know, now you're barren and no one will take care of you when
*  you're older and you have to live with your cat. Haha. Leave that to, you know, always Sunny to
*  make fun of, not you as a politician. So what do you think the future of the Republican Party looks
*  like in 2025 and going forward? Like, do we just do this forever? Are we chained to Donald Trump
*  until he dies and afterwards? I wish I could tell you no, but I don't think that that's,
*  I don't see any way that he goes away after this election as a potential presidential candidate.
*  He could go away, but I don't think that this is a situation where, you know, his power is going to
*  be dramatically diminished in part because I think that just given the state of affairs on the
*  democratic side of the perspective, I don't think that he's going to end up losing by enough to make
*  that happen. The Republican Party has a rising new generation of people who are now in significant
*  statewide positions and in the Senate. And that includes people who are espousing Trumpian views
*  in a lot of ways, but I would say that it's distinct in the sense that they have a different
*  priority set somehow than Trump and they are much more serious people. And whether that's
*  Josh Hawley or JD Vance, whether it's someone like Mark Wayne Mullen, who is certainly pro-Trump,
*  but has his own kind of priorities. It's one of these things where I think you're going to see
*  a group of members who similarly to what we've seen in the House are espousing a lot of things
*  that are Trump influenced, but adjacent or different or more serious. The Republican Party,
*  2025 and beyond, I think though, is really put in a position where it has to decide whether it's
*  going to try to appeal to the voters who they set aside in 2020, particularly suburban women,
*  and try to bring them back into the fold, or whether they are going to continue this approach
*  that basically says we can make up for losing them with a rising cohort of Hispanic Americans
*  in particular, but also I would say I think you're going to see the Asian American vote continue to
*  trend Republican in ways that have been successfully executed by some Republicans,
*  but certainly not to the level that they could nationally. But yeah, I think that the idea in
*  some people's minds that they can snap their fingers, that it's puss in boots, the last wish,
*  you find that star and then you can just wish that Donald Trump would go away. He's not going away.
*  And of course, as much as he is as aged as all of the rest of them, he's going to go until he
*  drops. And that's, I think, means that he's going to have influence over this party,
*  regardless of what happens in 2024. So something that we like to do on the show
*  is ask for book recommendations. So, Ben, do you have any book recommendations?
*  I have many book recommendations. I'm not going to, it would be cheating, but what I will say is that
*  this is a great summer to revisit or to introduce yourself to the entire pantheon of Cormac McCarthy.
*  Lots of people are familiar with the road, but people are not generally familiar, I think,
*  with some of his other works. And it's great to go back and read them after the author's passing.
*  But for three books for you, two from colleagues that I have at The Spectator, The War on the West
*  by Douglas Murray, I think is an essential reading to understanding the perspective of
*  conservatives, both in America and Britain, on the cultural battles that they see going on
*  all around them. That's just a couple of years old, and Douglas is an excellent analyst, I think.
*  Lionel Shriver, also a colleague of mine at The Spectator, has a book that's a couple of years old.
*  It's a novel called The Mandibles, which is essentially a, imagine the royal tenant
*  bombs going through a deep financial crisis. And it's very entertaining and dryly witty.
*  And then I mentioned Sam Talent before I am currently listening to the audiobook version
*  of his Running the Light novel, which is narrated by a series of prominent, mostly New York, but
*  national level comedians who take on each chapter. And it's hilarious and dark. And I like to do this
*  thing where I am reading a fiction book and reading a non-fiction book and listening to a
*  book at the same time, so you can balance in between. And so those are my three.
*  Lyle Ornstein Awesome. Well, Ben Domenech,
