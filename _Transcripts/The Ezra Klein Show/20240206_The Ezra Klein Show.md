# What Relationships Would You Want, if You Believed They Were Possible?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tvCuA6Pydo)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  One of my preoccupations in the past couple of years, and this comes out of issues in
*  my own life, it comes out of being a parent, it comes out of these larger social conversations
*  about loneliness epidemics and friendship recessions, is I think uniting a lot of difficulties
*  in the communal life of Americans, at least, is what I think of as the post-extended family
*  era.
*  That for a huge amount of time in human history, who we married, how we raised children, who
*  was around us was structured, for worse sometimes, but also often for better or just for reliability,
*  by the extended family, by a kin network.
*  There were always people, people you could make asks of, people who would make asks of
*  you, who parents aged around was decided, who would lend helping hands with kids was
*  known, who would help somebody find a romantic partner, that was a solved problem.
*  Again, not for everybody, but we had a structure.
*  And we're living through this wild experiment now.
*  We're living through the end of the age, the after the end of the age of the nuclear family.
*  As my colleague David Brooks says, we're in the nuclear family was actually a pretty punctuated
*  period of time when most people lived in that.
*  Now the share of Americans between the ages of 25 and 54 who are married has dwindled
*  from two thirds of the population in 1990 to barely half today.
*  Today about 40% of children are born to unmarried parents.
*  And what we're doing in my estimation is not working.
*  People are lonely.
*  They don't have enough friends.
*  It's incredibly hard to be a two parent, two job family raising children.
*  It is unimaginably hard to be a single parent with a job raising children.
*  You have a lot of people aging alone.
*  And I don't think we look at this expansively enough.
*  There's been a bunch of coverage recently of polyamory, which is like a wonderful thing
*  to discuss.
*  But polyamory doesn't solve aging.
*  It doesn't necessarily solve or even have that much to say about parenting.
*  And it doesn't say that much about relationships that are non-romantic.
*  And so I feel like I was a perfect audience for Raina Cohen's forthcoming book, The Other
*  Significant Others, Reimagining Life with Friendship at the Center, partially because
*  I have one of these very intense friendships near the center of my life.
*  And that's important to me.
*  And it was part of why moving across the country for me was a hard and difficult thing.
*  But also just because I think it is asking the right question, which is how do we open
*  the relational apertures of our lives?
*  How do we imagine many other possibilities for parenting, for aging, for intimacy, for
*  friendship, for romance, than what we have right now?
*  Because the idea that what we have right now is a working norm and everything else should
*  be understood as some deviation is wrong.
*  It is factually untrue.
*  It is not a norm.
*  It is a wild experiment in the history of human existence.
*  We have never done this before for any period of time.
*  It's not how we've raised children.
*  It is not how we've met each other.
*  It is not how we've lived together.
*  And it's not working for a lot of people.
*  So this is an experiment and we should be trying more.
*  And what Cohen's book is about is these experiments, is looking at things people are already doing.
*  And in a sense, making clear that there are more relationships happening right now in
*  the world around you, more forms of relationship than you can possibly imagine.
*  As always, my email is reclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Raina Cohen, welcome to the show.
*  Could not be happier to be here.
*  So there's been this burst of coverage of polyamory recently.
*  There was this New York Magazine cover.
*  There's this memoir.
*  There was a Times piece, a New Yorker piece, the Wall Street Journal had this piece about
*  how nobody on dating apps can find enough monogamous profiles.
*  What do you make of all this as somebody who covers relationships?
*  Why this?
*  Why now?
*  I think there's a growing recognition that the way people have been approaching their
*  romantic relationships is not working that well.
*  I can't tell you the number of people I've had repeat back to me this now famous line
*  from the psychotherapist Esther Perel that we now expect of one person, what we used
*  to expect of an entire village.
*  And as people are understanding that maybe it doesn't make sense to put everything on
*  one person because you're going to compromise the stability of that relationship, then it
*  opens the door to be thinking about, well, if it's not one person, then can you have
*  multiple people?
*  And, you know, I think it's becoming less taboo than it has been for a long time to
*  think about the possibility of having multiple romantic partners.
*  I find the conversation around this and particularly the emphasis on the multiple romantic partners,
*  it sounds weird to say this about polyamory, but I find it weirdly conservative.
*  People often frame this, I think, as just all about who you get to have sex with.
*  But people open up their marriages, people who particularly do so polyamorously, which
*  is what makes it different than just kinds of non-monogamy, they're often looking for
*  something more than sex.
*  What else do you think they're looking for?
*  I think people are looking for connection.
*  I mean, I just think even of the term an emotional affair, which is an indication that...
*  Such a good term.
*  So interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  That means that there have been no physical lines crossed, and yet there's still a sense
*  that someone is seeking something from another person that they're not getting in their partner,
*  and that there was a breach of trust that happened by being that close to another person.
*  So the existence of this term shows that people are not just looking for sex and physical
*  connection.
*  They maybe want to be understood.
*  Maybe they don't share some of the same interests and hobbies with somebody that they met 20
*  or just simply have more facets to them than one person can answer.
*  And I don't know that I would say that it's conservative that people are focusing on the
*  sex piece, but it feels like less imaginative, maybe.
*  And that there's this real narrow attention on the role that a sexual partner can play
*  when we really look for different things from so many people in our lives beyond a physical
*  connection of that kind.
*  Well, this is my somewhat canned way of getting to your book, because I found your book much
*  more radical than a lot of where this conversation goes, because I think we're used to the idea
*  that we can love and be dependent on people we have a romantic attachment to.
*  In a way, that's why polyamory is so threatening in a way that people often, I think, don't
*  find friendships threatening.
*  But this book is all about how we can love and be dependent on people we don't have romantic
*  attachments to.
*  So tell me a bit about why you got interested in that.
*  I think of the social scientist term of me search.
*  I kind of got here from a personal place, which is I have a friendship where, particularly
*  in the first couple of years of our friendship, it felt like it really scrambled the definition
*  of what friendship could be because of the level of closeness that we had.
*  For the first couple of years, we lived a five-minute walk from each other.
*  So most days of the week became really integrated into each other's lives.
*  Like we would BCC each other on emails to colleagues and all sorts of people.
*  Every time when you wrote about that, I found that terrifying.
*  I mean, they were never like that.
*  You're writing a work email and maybe you get the BCC field wrong.
*  Yeah, no, that is dangerous.
*  But anyway, we were very integrated into each other's lives to the point where the term
*  best friend didn't feel like it cut it.
*  Not just that it didn't kind of rise to the level of what the relationship was, but also
*  that it had a kind of juvenile form to it.
*  And it opened up so many questions for me, like if this is such a significant relationship
*  in my life, why is there a no term for it?
*  Are there other people like us out there?
*  What would it mean if we saw the possibility that friendship could be this close?
*  So it was catalyzed, like this whole project was catalyzed from a personal place of discovering
*  a friendship that went beyond what I was told a friendship could be.
*  I was interested in your focus in the book on the lack of language for relationships
*  like this, because sort of similarly to why you wrote the book, one of my interests in
*  the book is I have a relationship like this.
*  I have a best friend.
*  I've been friends with him since I was 16.
*  And it's very much a kind of life partnership.
*  When I moved from SF where he lives to New York where I live now, one of the great griefs
*  of that move was being separated from him and his family.
*  And it was hard to talk about with people because if I said I was moving away from my
*  wife, that something had happened, and now we had to be across the country from each
*  other because of our work or whatever, I think the misery of that would be legible.
*  People would really come to me, I think with a lot of sympathy.
*  Moving away from this other important partnership, like, oh, that's sad, but you don't make decisions
*  about where you live based on your friends or your best friends.
*  And it was interesting to me how difficult that experience was to convey.
*  It made me think a lot about how few gradations we have in the language for people we love.
*  I mean, we have spouses and partners and friends and best friends.
*  It's like four categories.
*  And there's a lot of human experience not captured in that.
*  When you were telling people about moving away, like, what was the language that you used?
*  I still use best friend.
*  I mean, now sometimes they'll say that there's like a platonic life partnership dimension
*  to that.
*  I don't really love that term.
*  It's just very clinical.
*  And also, I don't think people want to be assaulted by your endless rapsidizing or description
*  of your own interior relationships.
*  So you know, you kind of just move on.
*  Yeah.
*  The language issue came up again and again where people would come up with a term like
*  platonic life partner, platonic soulmate, non-romantic life partner, whatever.
*  And it would maybe be accurate, but people didn't get what it was.
*  So was the language really doing anything?
*  And then on the flip side, there were situations that I write about in the book where people
*  are in the hospital and then they refer to their friend as their sister or as their wife
*  because they're like, well, the thing that matters is that people get the connotation
*  right even if the particularities aren't right.
*  And I think it's a terrible thing to not be able to communicate what one of the most important
*  people in your life means to you and to have to hang on language that really might not
*  do justice to the relationship or give people the wrong impression about it.
*  So it feels like a big gap to fill in right now.
*  To use a nerdy term for this, there's a kind of countercyclical dimension to this book
*  because you're talking about these unusually deep friendships, these unusually deep partnerships
*  at the same time that the dominant discourse is about a loneliness epidemic, is about what
*  gets called a friendship recession.
*  So I want to open into some of that too.
*  What is the thing that people call the friendship recession?
*  So this came out of work by a survey researcher named Daniel Cox, who has done some of the,
*  I think, best work on friendship recently where he ended up tracking in a survey from
*  2021 just this precipitous decline in the number of close friends that Americans have.
*  And this is quite connected to loneliness.
*  He found that Americans who had three or fewer close friends are much more likely to say
*  that they were lonely in the last week than people who have 10 or more close friends.
*  So the loneliness epidemic is this term that has, I think, become ubiquitous because of
*  the surge in general.
*  And what this research on the decline in friendship shows is that the withdrawal that a lot of
*  people have had from their friendships, particularly American men, has really harmed people's
*  emotional lives and their sense of connectedness writ large.
*  I want to zoom in on that question of American men because we seem to be doing particularly
*  badly on this.
*  So another stat that's in your book that caught my eye is that in 1990, more than half of
*  men reported having at least six close friends.
*  In 2021, only about a quarter of men could say the same.
*  Fifteen percent of men report having no close friendships, a fivefold increase in the number
*  saying that from 1990.
*  So 1990 to 2020, we're talking about 30 years here.
*  It's not 300 years.
*  It's not 3000 years.
*  And there's been a pretty precipitous drop in the quantity and depth of male friendship.
*  Why do we suck at this?
*  One of the things that actually comes up in this survey and in other research is how men
*  really expect to get their emotional needs fulfilled from their female partners, but
*  they're not necessarily expecting to go to their male friends.
*  And I think some of the things that I've heard from men is like, they're not developing these
*  skills essentially, and that they're waiting to the point at which they're dating to develop
*  the kind of communication and emotional skills and are not necessarily applying that to their
*  friendships.
*  But some of this goes to like Robert Putnam, Bowling Alone, things around the ways that
*  men especially might have communed previously in larger group settings have fallen away.
*  And they might end up sort of fearing being perceived as gay if they have close relationships.
*  And we have a less homophobic society than we did previously, but not so much that people
*  don't fear that they're going to be misread if they have that kind of intimacy with another man.
*  I am not pretending my personal life is a representative sample, but my gay male friends
*  are so much better at friendship and have such a delightful, deep friendship community
*  compared to virtually anybody else I know, but particularly the straight men I know,
*  that it's really striking to me.
*  I mean, there is a, I can imagine reasons it might be, but the emphasis placed on friendship
*  there seems really quite different than what I see elsewhere.
*  Well, I would think particularly in the queer communities, there are so much emphasis on
*  friendship, partly because people can't necessarily rely on their families of origin to be the
*  people who are going to kind of ride through life with them because they might have rejected
*  them because of their sexuality.
*  So there's this long history of friends being chosen families.
*  So it really makes sense in the context of gay men.
*  But I even think about as a kid, the way that girls treated friendships as these entities
*  to celebrate and to talk about.
*  We would exchange friendship bracelets, we would honor the friendship, and that's a thing
*  that can kind of fall away to some extent, I think, in adulthood.
*  In general, we don't treat friendship as this thing that we are supposed to work toward
*  getting better at or achieving or that it's a mark of a successful adulthood.
*  But I think for men, there's even less emphasis than there is for women on having that as
*  a big piece of their life.
*  Tell me a bit about the stray of Art and Nick.
*  Yeah, I mean, Art and Nick are pretty remarkable guys.
*  They met in a Christian college together training to be youth pastors, both raised to be in
*  conservative congregations.
*  Over time, Art fully came to terms with the fact that he's gay, which created a real
*  conflict for him because in his reading of the Bible, which he literally sat down and
*  read to try to interpret what it was saying, he did not believe it was okay for him to
*  engage in same-sex romantic relationships.
*  So he decided that in order to reconcile his faith, which was so important to him, and
*  his sexuality, that he was going to be celibate.
*  He said that celibacy was the worst thing he could possibly imagine, not because of
*  the giving up sex part, but because of not having a person to come home to at the end
*  of the day, someone to hand him a warm mug of tea.
*  And he had this friend Nick from college who was his best friend, who was a straight man,
*  and came from this conservative background where he's very kind of concerned with doing
*  what everybody else does.
*  But he was like, this is not your problem, this is our problem.
*  I want to help you figure out how to make this work.
*  And suggested that they live together.
*  They'd already talked about each other as being brothers to each other, that that's
*  how they conceived of each other, and wanted to live as a family.
*  And that Nick expected to get married to a woman at some point, and that Art would be
*  part of that family, that he would either live next door or with them.
*  So they've had extraordinarily explicit conversations about the role that they are playing in each
*  other's lives and as it's evolved.
*  And at this point, they live together, they recently moved to be closer to Nick's girlfriend,
*  who they're very serious.
*  And it's a very unconventional relationship that they have had to navigate all on their own.
*  What was so striking about their story to me is that there felt to me to be multiple
*  pieces of having to fight against both expectations and interpretations that would be put on you.
*  These are two men in Christian pastoral circles, right?
*  For Art, he's already in a certain amount of conflict with a lot of the world of his
*  faith.
*  For Nick, right, to be living now with a professed gay man, that I'm sure creates a certain
*  amount of friction to be meeting women and saying that, you know, if you're going to
*  be in a relationship with me in a way you're also going to be in a relationship with Art.
*  How did they navigate that pressure?
*  They've run into a lot of misinterpretations and have faced really concrete consequences
*  for people's misunderstanding of their relationship and judgment of it.
*  Nick has tried dating women before the woman he's with now, who have been concerned that
*  it is actually a sexual relationship or that there's too much room for flirtation and also
*  want more of Nick's presence in their life.
*  Nick also grew up in an environment where even having any kind of physical or emotional
*  intimacy with another man was out of bounds for him.
*  In fact, there was a point where he wondered if he was gay because he liked to hug Art
*  and missed him.
*  He had to go on his own process to figure out, okay, if I'm not comfortable with Art
*  putting his arm on my shoulder, is that because I actually don't like it or is it because
*  I've been programmed to believe that this is not acceptable and am I just afraid that
*  people are going to assume that I'm gay?
*  There's a lot of deprogramming that Nick had to do and that Art helped through the process
*  because he comes from such a different vantage point.
*  There have been professional consequences to their relationship because some people
*  cannot seem to believe that it is a friendship.
*  They've just determined over time that it's worth making the sacrifices of maybe Nick
*  not finding a romantic partner, though it seems like it has now worked out, and Art
*  having to change professions really because of the way that people on the internet, in
*  the evangelical internet, people in his denomination found it unacceptable that two men, one of
*  whom is gay, would live together.
*  I understand how friendships that start early in your life escalate to this very high level.
*  You just have so much shared history and it was so much easier to become really close
*  to somebody when, at least for me, when I was young and you could spend this atmospheric
*  time playing Tony Hawk after school and just like wandering around.
*  But if you're somebody who does want deeper, closer friendships, put aside these platonic
*  life partner friendships, just you want to be on the relationship escalator with friendships.
*  Romantic relationships have this very structured way of doing it.
*  I mean, there's this question eventually of do we move in together?
*  Do we get married?
*  Right?
*  Do you leave a toothbrush at my house?
*  There's also a lot of space for having that conversation, the what are we conversation?
*  What are we doing here?
*  How do people escalate a friendship?
*  If you want to turn something that's warm and close and has some chemistry to it, to
*  something more central, I think that's mysterious to people.
*  What have you learned about that?
*  So I talked to a researcher named Lisa Diamond, who's a psychologist, and one of the things
*  that she told me is that for any kind of attachment relationship, it doesn't have to be romantic,
*  but there are three magic ingredients, and those are time, togetherness, and touch.
*  So what you're describing there of spending boundless time playing Tony Hawk or whatever,
*  and maybe there's some kind of rough housing, that as kids are in these environments like
*  summer camp or in dorms, we are really naturally getting those ingredients to become really
*  close to another person.
*  So I think I would start from a place of figuring out how do you get more of each of those things?
*  And one way to do it is to change your environment, and that could be a bigger project like with
*  the sort of co-living setup or living within a neighborhood with friends where it's very
*  easy to come by time and togetherness with another person.
*  The other kind of thing that comes to mind comes from somebody that I interviewed, Art,
*  who said that this really close friendship that he has with Nick made him start to think
*  about what his other friendships could be, and he would ask himself, what is the fullest
*  version of this friendship?
*  And for any given friendship, that did not mean that he wanted to have a partnership
*  level friendship.
*  Love is infinite and time is not.
*  As the saying goes, that wasn't going to be possible, but he would think about and talk
*  with the friends about in a given friendship what would make it a richer friendship.
*  And in one case, he decided with this couple that he was friends with that they were going
*  to co-work once a week, and that meant he would be in their space, and he was sort of
*  seeing how they interact more with their kid.
*  If we could ask ourselves that kind of question and really approach friendships with more
*  curiosity rather than these sort of hardened limits on what they can be, I think it is
*  possible to move toward closer relationships.
*  When you offer those three ingredients, touch made me wonder if this isn't one of the difficulties
*  for men, at least in the United States and sort of peer countries.
*  I'm pretty far out on the bell curve of intense close male friendships, and I am not particularly
*  comfortable with touch within those relationships.
*  And I always think of this moment in my childhood when I was pretty friendless when I was young,
*  and this kid had moved to town and we became very close friends.
*  It was third grade, I think.
*  And I remember my mom was taking us for ice cream, and I held this kid's hand.
*  And she's like, oh, boys don't do that.
*  And my mom, it was not, I mean, she was right, right?
*  They don't do that here.
*  And as a kid, you got teased all the time and bullied all the time.
*  Trying to hold boys' hands at school would not have helped the situation.
*  But that has always stuck with me.
*  And not that many male relationships I know feature much touch, whereas a lot of the female
*  friendships I know touch is very normal, like they'll cuddle together watching a movie on
*  the couch.
*  If that is so important, and I had not heard that in terms of friendship before, that does
*  strike me as a genuine disadvantage that men have in forming close relationships in this
*  society where we've been socialized intensely against touch within these relationships.
*  Your mom is just channeling the culture and trying to protect you, probably.
*  I'm like a very physically affectionate person, so the idea of being raised as a man in this
*  culture is like, I don't know who I would be if that were a form of communication that
*  was cut off for me.
*  Men are physical.
*  They cuddle with their, straight men cuddle with their female partners.
*  And yeah, it does feel like a disadvantage.
*  I think what is so moving to me about Nick's story is he undergoes this transformation because
*  of his friendship with art, who not only is gay and has sort of different expectations
*  around physical intimacy because of that, but he's also Brazilian American.
*  So a lot of his norms are shaped by what he experienced in Brazil or among his friends
*  from that part of the world where men kiss each other.
*  They are much more physically affectionate and this real linkage between masculinity and
*  kind of stoicism and keeping space is not there.
*  I remember Nick told me that he noticed that his dad wouldn't even sit right next to him
*  on the couch.
*  He needed to leave room and he couldn't remember the last time his dad hugged him.
*  So there are just real cultural norms that you have to swim upstream for.
*  My hope is that reading some of the history and realizing that this is so culturally and
*  historically contingent, the way that men interact with each other and are very cut
*  off and just seeing examples of men doing things differently, at least can maybe open
*  conversations because I suspect that if three men were sitting in a row the way that I was
*  with my two female friends that maybe some of them would be interested on some level
*  in physical affection but are like, no, but they're not.
*  So I'm not going to make an overture.
*  So we track back to 1990 a minute ago, but your book throws the ball backwards further.
*  I appreciate it because it's always on my mind as somebody who ends up for political
*  reasons reading a lot of history from the 16th and 17th and 18th centuries and you'll
*  have these male legislators professing their unbelievably ardent undying love to each other
*  in completely banal letters.
*  There'll be a bunch of things about how the farm is going that year and it's like, and
*  as a person who keeps the other half of my soul know that I think about you.
*  Jefferson and Madison, they really have a deep romance going on and you talk about this
*  going back.
*  I mean, you talk about how in Rome people talked about their friends in ways we now
*  talk about spouses.
*  It would call them the better half of my soul, the better part of my soul.
*  The letters you read, what happened to drain so much of the ardor out of friendship?
*  Male friendship and female friendship alike, but I think even more male friendship.
*  I mean, I think it's still quite common for female friends to profess a kind of love to
*  each other.
*  It's not that common for male friends.
*  Yeah, I think seeing some of this history is kind of astonishing to a lot of people
*  and often requires like a whole string of like context and caveats because it is so
*  unfamiliar to our eyes and ears.
*  One of the letters that I cite here as from the 1700s where this man was talking about
*  his physical heart, which was not in good condition.
*  He was like, however soon so ever my feeble heart shall stop, its last pulsations shall
*  vibrate for you.
*  That sounds like a love letter to a lot of us now, but I don't actually think contextually
*  we have any reason to believe that that was necessarily about romantic or sexual love.
*  As different historians have put it, it was not understood in the past that in order to
*  love someone, you also had to lust after them.
*  A big factor that matters here is that there were not these categories of homosexuality
*  and heterosexuality as we understand it now as these sort of fixed identities, homosexuality
*  being stigmatized.
*  It was very possible for men to say and do all sorts of things that we now code as sexual
*  and it was seen as totally innocent.
*  When people speculate, for instance, about Lincoln being gay because he shared a bed
*  with a man, it was very common for men to share beds for practical reasons.
*  That in and of itself is not necessarily an indication of someone's desire.
*  It really has to do with the introduction of the stigmatized identity of homosexuality
*  and concerns about sodomy that took away the innocence of what had been totally normal
*  behavior among men.
*  How much of it is also about the rise of marriages that are for love?
*  Not just for love, but what I guess the sociologists now call assortative.
*  It used to be, I mean, in a lot of cultures still is, that you married people who your
*  family found for you, approved for you.
*  There's obviously arranged marriages, but there's also just the, you married the person
*  down the block, right?
*  You married somebody who made sense.
*  You married the first person that you wanted to sleep with when you were of age for that
*  kind of thing.
*  You married somebody who your family could use like the union with their family.
*  And so it wasn't expected that the person you married would always be your deepest intellectual
*  partner, the person with whom your soul would vibrate.
*  And so there was a reason, like an obvious reason that you would look for that externally
*  and that as marriage became the site of love, these friendships became competitive with
*  it, right?
*  I mean, you're supposed to have one soulmate.
*  So how much is that a dynamic here?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you're describing the other part of the twin trends here.
*  So you have the decline of friendship, but also these changing expectations of what a
*  good marriage was supposed to be.
*  And we went from marriage really being this pragmatic union that was very much about joining
*  families to one where love was supposed to be the basis.
*  And then more recently, what Eli Finkel, who's a psychologist at Northwestern, has called
*  the self-expressive marriage.
*  So he says basically, like, we want our spouse to be the Michelangelo to our stone and unlock
*  the best version within us.
*  And that is very different from a time where you have tons of sex segregation, where you
*  have inequality between the genders, where when men own their wives, like how much emotional
*  and intellectual connection are they really going to have?
*  I mean, it makes a lot of sense under those circumstances to find greater intimacy with
*  your same sex friends than you would with your partner to whom you're not an equal.
*  And, you know, as you mentioned, there are still lots of people who have marriages along
*  these lines that are arranged.
*  And I remember talking to a friend of mine whose mother had an arranged marriage in India
*  and her mother and her female friends, who had all had arranged marriages, they didn't
*  expect their husbands to be the most important person who filled all these roles, like, you
*  know, to go back to your first question.
*  And their female friendships were so important.
*  And I'm sure kind of the same thing was the case for the men too.
*  So the marriage expectations really have crowded out the room for friendship to be as significant
*  as it once was.
*  So it feels like that would all be fine if we all had these super successful, self-expressive,
*  soulmate level marriages.
*  But the stats here are rough.
*  The divorce rate for first marriages, it keeps hovering around 50%.
*  The rate for second and third marriages is even higher than that.
*  The average divorced marriage lasts eight years.
*  For first marriages, 40% of kids are born to unmarried people.
*  I'm a child of parents who eventually got divorced.
*  It doesn't seem to be working exactly.
*  I mean, you just had this big book by Melissa Kearney, who's an economist making the point
*  that stable marriages are really good for kids.
*  But I think that the weakness of that book, because I buy the data in it, is that she
*  doesn't have, and nobody else has, a theory or a program that seems effective for what
*  to do about this.
*  Even if you believe the marriage should be the central unit of society, what to do about
*  the fact that they seem to keep breaking up really feels to me like a deeply unsolved
*  problem.
*  You have this lovely line in the book where you say we both hold dual citizenship in the
*  kingdom of the single and the kingdom of the coupled.
*  That reality of people's lives, that you might put everything you have into finding the single
*  partner and then you get divorced or they die or something happens, that feels like
*  a real issue here.
*  Marriage is a wonderful institution, but literally on the face of everything we know about it,
*  it doesn't survive.
*  It doesn't provide everything for most people.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, really marriage is a temporary status of our adult lives.
*  Look at the marriage trends.
*  People are getting married later.
*  Let's say you get married at 30 or 35.
*  What do you do for 10, 15 years of your adult life?
*  Who is your next of kin?
*  Who's going to make decisions on your behalf?
*  As you pointed out, how many marriages dissolve, but let's say it's a great case and your marriage
*  survives until one spouse passes away.
*  If you're in a heterosexual relationship, it's likely to be the woman who's outliving
*  the man.
*  The stats are pretty startling.
*  A third of women over 65 are widowed and almost half of women over 65 are unpartnered.
*  It is okay to say that marriage is meaningful, but we also need to be thinking about these
*  other periods of life for people outside of marriage or if they don't get married at all,
*  which a lot of people are not.
*  Tell me a bit about Barbara and Ines.
*  Barbara and Ines are a pair of women who I profiled in the book, a couple of the first
*  to who I met at a home that they share in the suburbs of St. Louis.
*  They have been best friends for more than 50 years.
*  In Ines' case, she did the marriage thing in the way she was supposed to.
*  She got married very young back in the 1960s, had two kids by the time she was in her mid-20s,
*  had a house in the suburbs and all that.
*  Her husband was not a great husband, not great to her sons.
*  Despite it being relatively rare at that time to get divorced, she did and started
*  a job to take care of her kids, to provide for them.
*  She met a woman named Barb.
*  Barb herself was in a place where she didn't expect her life to go.
*  She had moved back home to take care of her parents' finances and she couldn't have
*  children biologically.
*  She's an only child, had always wanted biological children so that she could see another human
*  being who looked like her.
*  Her desire for marriage really waned because of that not being able to have a child of
*  her own.
*  The two of them basically became like family.
*  Barb took care of the kids.
*  They went on vacations together.
*  How did the two of them become family?
*  I'm interested in that turn.
*  Well, they started doing things that friends don't often do.
*  I think one key moment began with Barb being a little forward and just asking if she can
*  join a trip that Inez was going on with her sons to Washington, D.C.
*  Barb was like, I've never been, can I come?
*  And Inez said yes.
*  That was a two-week trip where Inez and Barb had a long road trip with these two kids who
*  I think were around pre-teens.
*  That gave them a sense that they could camp together, share space together, that the kids
*  respected her.
*  Barb loved kids and she really connected to them.
*  At points where maybe people would not have, I don't know, made the decisions on behalf
*  of a friend, they did.
*  So Barb, as I mentioned, had only moved back to the St. Louis area with her family for
*  a temporary reason.
*  She decided to go back to Phoenix where she had been living and offered for Inez and her
*  kids to move and said that they could stay here until you find a home.
*  And that's what Inez did.
*  So there was some kind of like leap of faith there to follow the other person.
*  I was so struck by a stat in that chapter.
*  We write that friendships are actually more predictive, or at least a little bit more
*  predictive of mortality than marriage.
*  I mean, at a certain point in your life, whether you still have friends tells you a little
*  bit more about how you're doing than whether you're still married.
*  One thing I found affecting about the Inez and Barb story is there are a lot of stories
*  in your book, and we'll get to some of them, where people are living out something that
*  they understand to be counter-cultural.
*  They have to put work in against societal expectations, sometimes against legal structures.
*  That's not true for the two of them.
*  They have this real practicality about it.
*  We did this because it made sense.
*  Inez has children and she has a completely useless husband in that respect.
*  And Barbara Lee On becomes helpful.
*  I mean, when you were saying Barb invites herself along on a trip to Washington, D.C.
*  as a parent of some kids, if I were taking my kids alone to Washington, D.C., and anybody,
*  no matter whether I like them or not, was willing to come along and help, I would say
*  yes to that offer.
*  And it did seem to me some of the reciprocity of their relationship was built in early co-parenting.
*  They may not always have called it that, but that clearly seems to me to have been what
*  it is.
*  And this is a space where I think my interest is bigger than in any other space here.
*  Because the part of life I'm going through right now, it's very clear to me that you're
*  not supposed to raise multiple kids with two full-time working parents.
*  It's nothing of just one parent.
*  You need a lot more help.
*  And that ability to give and give back help, it really does bond people together.
*  I mean, it's bonded me closer to family, who I wasn't as close with before, but the way
*  they've shown up for us and our children has meant the world to me.
*  It's bonded me with the friends who have been there in that way for us.
*  But it still feels like there should be more possibilities here.
*  So I wanted to ask you about another of the stories, which is Natasha and Linda.
*  Can you tell me a bit about them?
*  So Natasha, when she was 36, decided that she was going to have a child on her own.
*  So she had an anonymous donor sperm, was pregnant.
*  Her friend Linda, who she knew as a fellow law professor where they worked, wanted to
*  be the birth coach and kind of help her through her pregnancy.
*  And Natasha ended up having an emergency c-section.
*  Linda was there, the first person to hold the baby.
*  She described, I think, seeing the boy, Alon, as some marvelous love mom or something.
*  She's just so effusive and really fell in love with the baby immediately and slept in
*  the same bed as Natasha, waking up every three and a half hours to feed Alon and continued
*  to have this really important role in Alon's life.
*  But it took years to figure out that she was really acting as a co-parent and that she
*  wanted to have legal recognition as a parent and ended up asking Natasha if she would go
*  along with it, which she would.
*  And there were some obstacles along the way that I can talk about that point to the very
*  limited ways that we think about who can be parents.
*  But Linda just was there for the kid and provided support to Natasha in a way that really parents
*  do and maybe we don't necessarily expect friends to.
*  Well, I think it's worth talking about at least some of them.
*  I mean, I found the story so affecting.
*  Something you didn't mention is Alon has significant health challenges and you have a beautiful
*  line in there where he didn't just need two parents, he needed all the parents he could
*  get.
*  I see this in my own older son, who will be five around when this comes out.
*  And the degree to which he wants other figures in his life, it's so obvious to me.
*  I mean, a big part of the reason we moved across the country was to be near to my wife's
*  parents, his grandparents.
*  And he is so delighted to be near to his grandparents.
*  It means so much to him.
*  He loves them so much.
*  He loves all of his grandparents so much.
*  But also just other figures, right?
*  Loves my best friend back in SF so much, right?
*  Kids feel very tuned to me to have a lot of aloe parents, as they're called in their lives.
*  I mean, again, the idea that it would just be two is weird, but it then gets to what
*  I think of as the oddity of these legal obstacles.
*  So it is one of the most common concerns in American politics.
*  It's so many children grow up right now in single parent families and single parents
*  do amazing, heroic and to me genuinely unimaginable work.
*  But if they meet somebody, a stepfather or stepmother potentially, the path there to
*  that person becoming a recognized parent to the kid in legal ways is very smooth, very
*  straightforward, right?
*  The braiding of the romantic relationship without any biological relationship is very
*  accepted.
*  Your mom has divorced your dad, your mom has a boyfriend, the boyfriend becomes a partner,
*  now that's your new stepfather.
*  And we think, great, a two parent family again, that there's no way to do that, that it's
*  so unusual and weird to actually say, oh, my best friend or actually like another family
*  member or will become part of this child's life in a legal factual way.
*  Again just strikes me as a kind of poverty of imagination, right?
*  We want children to have more adult figures in their life who are emotionally there, who
*  are financially there, who are just there with time.
*  I mean, time matters in many ways more than anything else.
*  And yet we really only create a speedway for one kind that has to clear a sexual romantic
*  test first, no matter whether that person is a good father or a good mother to that
*  child.
*  It seems strange.
*  We've worked backwards from a problem, but only if we can solve a secondary problem along
*  the way.
*  Well, there's a law professor I think puts this nicely named Sasha Goupay that she says
*  that the law puts misplaced emphasis on eros, so like sexual love, and not enough on agape,
*  so self-sacrificing love.
*  And if it were possible for people to maybe disconnect the sexual part from the parenting,
*  then the law and our society might recognize that there are more kinds of people who could
*  be wonderful parental figures.
*  So Natasha and Linda, who are both legal scholars, they don't understand the emphasis on romance.
*  I mean, Linda said that it's an irrational test for parenthood, that she said romance
*  is lovely, but really what feels like it matters is compatibility and trust and all of that.
*  And then on the flip side, there are people more on the right or the center, like Brad
*  Wilcox, who literally has a book called Get Married that's coming out.
*  And he really is trying to prevent divorce and so on, and says that, again, focusing
*  so much on romance from his perspective makes relationships more fragile, and that if people
*  focused more on the raising of the children, then that would be a stronger foundation for
*  forming families.
*  Like, these people have really different outcomes that they're looking toward.
*  One is trying to push toward one specific kind of family, and the other is trying to
*  broaden them, but both have arrived at this idea that there are other kinds of characteristics
*  that really matter when it comes to raising a child.
*  I know so many people who want to have children but haven't met the right partner.
*  I know people who have had children, gotten divorced, then met people who are a good partner
*  for them, but not a good parent for their child.
*  But because they need to braid those roles, they can't be in this partnership that might
*  be fulfilling.
*  And I know people who have great relationships with other people in their life and would
*  probably be really good at raising children together and can't do that.
*  And what it also means is you can't distribute weight.
*  What I was thinking about when you're bringing up Brad Wilcox's book, and Wilcox is, like,
*  I think a very important scholar of marriage and family breakdown, is that we know that
*  Children put incredible stress on a marriage.
*  And I see it in my own life, like, the fact that we can pay for care, the fact that we
*  can do something financially that relieves some of that stress so my wife and I can have
*  a date night every two weeks so that we can occasionally go away together, right?
*  And we also move closer to family for, in part for that reason.
*  It relieves stress on our marriage.
*  There was an Atlantic article a couple years ago about a couple that raises their children
*  with one of their best friends who's asexual.
*  And I read that.
*  That sounds wonderful.
*  It does seem to me that even if the only thing you really cared about in life was getting
*  people back into stable romantic partnerships, that being more imaginative about how to take
*  the pressure off of those partnerships, and particularly to take some of the pressure
*  of parenting off of those partnerships, which, again, richer families do with money, but
*  you can't do that if you're, you know, middle class or working class.
*  It just strikes me as a place where our cultural expectations have come into conflict with
*  the things that we now say we value.
*  I don't know if this is the place to say that I live with a couple of my friends and their
*  kids, so I get to experience a little bit firsthand what it looks like to have other
*  adult figures in the picture.
*  Right.
*  Tell me a bit about how that began.
*  You mentioned this at the end of the book, and I'm very curious about it.
*  Yeah.
*  My husband and I are very interested, like, have been interested for a long time in living
*  with friends, and we ended up in a conversation with a couple of our friends where the idea
*  of living together came up.
*  They were, to our surprise, very interested, and they did not think that we would be interested
*  because they already had one child at the time and were planning to have more children,
*  in addition to other things like my husband and I are relatively secular, they are observant
*  Jews, so like, you know, keep a kosher kitchen, keep Shabbat and all that, and kind of figured
*  we wouldn't be, want to deal with all that.
*  But we were really excited to live with these particular friends, and we have been for about
*  two and a half years, and I think one of the fun and apt ways I've heard someone else
*  describe the relationship that my husband and I have to our friends' children is as
*  grandparents, where your pure existence just makes them attached to you.
*  My housemate was telling me last night that as his older son was going to bed and he said,
*  I love you, Abba, which Abba is, he preferred Dad, and he was like, and I love Ima, so like,
*  Mom, and I love, and he's like, you know, goes, talks about his brother, and then he
*  says, and I love Coco, and I love Reina, Coco is the nickname that this kid has for
*  my husband, and he, as a three and a half year old, like, sees us as part of this sort
*  of same household unit, and I mean, there are all sorts of ways that I know that my
*  life is enriched by having access to these kids, but also that my friends enjoy our presence
*  as other adults in their kids' lives, and I think pressure on them is relieved.
*  A couple weeks ago, my housemates were trying to figure out whether to take their older
*  son to the hospital, to the ER, and one of them went to my husband and was like, can
*  you hold the baby for 10 minutes while we go and figure this out?
*  And that's not co-parenting, like holding a baby for 10 minutes, but they had somebody
*  that they could just sort of relieve them of responsibility while they were in this
*  really hectic moment.
*  You know, it's just like one of the many ways that just simply having more people around,
*  even if they're not rising to the level of being equal co-parents, can make the parenting
*  experience so much less stressful.
*  And I think that the kids love to have other adults who love them.
*  There are just so many ways that my life has been enriched that, yeah, like there are toys
*  on the floor and there are particularly with two kids, I feel like there's a bump up in
*  chaos.
*  That's also how I felt about it, yes.
*  And I just think that everything comes with the pluses and minuses and that it is so much
*  easier to overweight the negatives of the unconventional decisions and to overlook the
*  negatives of the conventional decision.
*  I have a friend who both lives in what I would kind of describe as a commune.
*  I think that the modern term that gets used is intentional co-living community and also
*  helps set them up.
*  And I was asking her about this once about these tradeoffs.
*  And she said something that has always stuck with me, which is that she's decided to choose
*  the default in her life being the problems of community as opposed to the problems of
*  not having community.
*  She wants the problems of connection rather than the problems of how to find that connection.
*  And it seems so obvious when she said it that way, but I never thought of it that way.
*  I think what's interesting there is that she is saying something that people are maybe
*  making decisions around, but don't realize that they're making decisions around.
*  Like, you know, when I have toured through my friend's beautiful houses that are far
*  away from all of their other friends, I sometimes wonder, I'm like, oh, you've got this
*  gorgeous kitchen, but what are you giving up to have this beautiful kitchen island and
*  this renovated home?
*  And I'm not going to be obnoxious and start that conversation with a friend there.
*  But I do think that people are creating conditions where they are disconnected, but are
*  so focused on maybe the benefits that look like the shiny forms of success that you have,
*  this nice house that you own and it's your lawn that you get to mow and you don't hear
*  anybody else.
*  And privacy and control has a lot of benefits.
*  But like when the car breaks down and you need to get your kids to daycare and you don't
*  know any of your neighbors and you're called the sack of five houses, like, well, you've
*  like given something up in the process.
*  Tell me about the idea of an invariable.
*  I found that to be helpful language.
*  Yeah, this is from Sheila Hedy's novel, How Should a Person Be?
*  And she is writing about people who have this kind of really intimate and separable
*  friendship and these two women are kind of repairing their relationship.
*  So one of the characters tells the other, well, it's like in life you have the variables
*  and you have the invariables and you want to use them all.
*  But you work around the invariables.
*  I thought you were an invariable and then you left without saying a word.
*  Then the other friend thinks very deep inside, something began to vibrate.
*  I was an invariable.
*  An invariable.
*  No word had ever sounded to me more like love.
*  I think an invariable is really the opposite of the way that we think about friendship,
*  that friendship is peripheral and is fungible, dispensable.
*  You know, you can move across the country from your friend and you'll make new friends.
*  And an invariable is somebody who is going to be at the center of your life and that
*  other things work around.
*  This to me is one of the tensions of the book, which is there is room really only for so
*  many invariables in life.
*  What my children need is an invariable.
*  What my wife needs to me is an invariable.
*  And one of the challenges, it seems to me, is what happens when invariables clash and
*  collide. It's all great to talk about having more wonderful, deep, intimate, caring,
*  interdependent relationships, but they take a lot of management.
*  They can fall into conflict with each other.
*  It's like an almost inhuman level of communication.
*  How do you think about the downside, the dark side of this?
*  The you know, I mean, we talked earlier about control and that being a push towards small
*  nuclear families and single family boxes.
*  But there's also just simplicity.
*  How many people's needs are you really balancing?
*  How many people do you have to answer to?
*  How many people can you really answer to with a busy life and a job and all the rest of
*  it? How do you think, I guess, about the skills and to the tradeoffs here?
*  And then what happens when, you know, it turns out somebody felt like an invariable and now
*  they're not? Or they are in your heart, but you've got to make choices.
*  Tell me a bit about the conflict at the heart of a lot of this.
*  We are used to dealing with conflict between the needs of people that we love and that
*  we think of as well, absolutely.
*  I have to meet this need.
*  Children, spouses, aging parents.
*  It's not like we are freed from this conflict if we only have a romantic partner.
*  It's just that maybe those are different categories of people.
*  And I think like we're going to disappoint people in our lives.
*  We're not going to be able to be there for everybody at every single moment.
*  And it would be a sad thing to proactively withdraw from relationships because you
*  think that at some point there might be some conflict that's not resolvable, where
*  you have to make a choice. And sometimes these things are difficult and people have to
*  put one person in front of the other.
*  But I feel like the first thing I'm just trying to get people to do is realize that you
*  can add more people as factors.
*  You can treat more people as worth making these decisions around.
*  Maybe you're going to have to have hard conversations with people and develop those
*  communication skills that we sure can use where we are honest about what our bandwidth
*  is or where our priority has to be for some portion of our lives.
*  But, you know, I am reminded of something that Nick's girlfriend told me where she
*  also has this kind of chosen family that she last I know anyway was living with them, had
*  moved across the country with them.
*  When I had brought up this question to her about like, is it exhausting basically to
*  negotiate all these relationships and so on?
*  She was like, well, of course it's exhausting.
*  Like, family is exhausting.
*  People you love are exhausting.
*  But the 5% of the time that it's complicated and hard is so outweighed by every other
*  moment where you're getting so much for it.
*  Like we are making our lives unnecessarily deprived by hoping that simplicity will
*  solve us of having to make these tradeoffs.
*  And I think for a lot of people at the very least, they're going to have to make
*  tradeoffs about do they take care of their aging parents or take care of their kids?
*  Like the math here is not straightforward.
*  That sometimes having more people means that you are giving more and other times it
*  means you're getting more support.
*  So in the case of Art, when he had this big falling out at his workplace, it was Nick's
*  girlfriend who was also supporting him in addition to Nick.
*  So I think it's also worth paying attention to the ways that it can add to your life and
*  not just the conflicts it creates.
*  One thing that struck me in your book was that there's actually research on this on
*  marriages in the context of many friendships, survey research.
*  What does that show?
*  That basically the same principle that applies to finances also applies to relationships,
*  that it's good to diversify your portfolio and have multiple people in your life.
*  So to name a couple of studies on this, there is one that shows that people who have more
*  close relationships are happier in their marriages than those who have few close
*  relationships outside their marriage, so, you know, friendships.
*  And another that was, as you were alluding to, measuring cortisol, so like a stress
*  response and found that people who were married and were more satisfied with the level of
*  social support they had outside their marriage had less of a cortisol spike than those
*  who weren't as satisfied with the relationships that they had outside of their marriage.
*  So there is indications besides maybe your intuition that distributing the load
*  across multiple people and not having this kind of like one stop shopping approach to
*  relationships can actually make the romantic relationship stronger.
*  It feels so intuitive to me on one level, which is that and she's written about this
*  before, so I'm not speaking out of school, but my wife went through four or five years
*  where she was very sick and we didn't really know what was going on and was just exhausted.
*  I mean, truly clinically exhausted all the time.
*  And that was an incredibly hard period in my life.
*  And I thought a lot about what that period would have been like if I didn't live physically
*  near deep support.
*  And that also changed my feelings about a lot of this.
*  Like it made it clear to me how other important relationships end up being fortifying
*  for a marriage.
*  Yeah, I mean, I there are like more people to hold your hand or more people to vent to
*  or more people to send you food.
*  And it is not the way that maybe we're told to set our priorities because you're really
*  supposed to funnel so much energy in one person.
*  But there is fragility there.
*  I mean, a very formative experience for me was watching a relative of mine who had gone
*  through two successive long term relationships, like four or five years apiece, and was all
*  consumed in them and had his confidant and lover and intellectual partner and all in
*  one. After each of those relationships ended, he really didn't have anybody around.
*  And it made me, even as like a teenager, decide like that's not what I wanted.
*  Like I wanted to have multiple people in my life, both to enjoy the richness of each of
*  their kind of personalities and experiences, but also so that like when things are bad,
*  you aren't down to one person or if things end down to zero.
*  So then always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So my first book is by Andrew Solomon.
*  It's called Far From the Tree and it made a huge impact on me.
*  It's a nonfiction book about parents who are fundamentally different from their child on
*  some dimension. And every chapter is about a different one, like children who have dwarfism,
*  who are deaf, who are prodigies, who are trans.
*  And he's like looking at the extreme for a situation that I think is true of all parents,
*  that you are raising a child who is not you, who is a different being.
*  And that especially with these parents and these children that they have to learn to
*  love their kids on their own terms.
*  And it's really a beautiful book.
*  The second is a novel called We All Want Impossible Things by Katherine Newman.
*  Are you laughing because you know this?
*  No, I just love that. I just love the title.
*  Oh, and the cover is great, too, because it has like a soda can in it and there is both a
*  flower in the soda can and a straw.
*  It is a hilarious book, which you might not expect because it takes place in a hospice.
*  And it is about one friend taking care of the other at the end of her life.
*  And it just does this beautiful job of showing the kind of intermingling of existential
*  dread and the pain of losing someone, but also the kind of absurdity of the end of life
*  and the mundanity of the end of life.
