# Best Of: Status Games, Polyamory and the Merits of Meritocracy
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsvEi6pxV68)
*  Hey, it is Ezra.
*  Before we begin today, we've gotten some questions about our release schedule and whether that
*  has changed.
*  And the answer is sort of.
*  For a long time, we've done in practice, five, six, seven episodes a month.
*  And that has shifted month to month, depending on whether they're holidays, whether my kids
*  got me sick, that kind of thing.
*  We have fixed that now at six episodes to make it possible for us to plan.
*  And we're not using as many rears and crossovers to fill the gaps.
*  So from here on out, you'll really have something like two weeks a month with two episodes,
*  two weeks a month with one episode.
*  Things could shift a bit depending on news cycles and other things, but that should be
*  where things sit, at least for the foreseeable future.
*  But today we are doing a rear, a conversation I enjoyed very much when it happened a few
*  years back, and that I think speaks to some issues in the news lately with a little bit
*  more force.
*  So please enjoy my talk with Agnes Callard.
*  I'm Ezra Klein and this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Right now, if I were to list my top five regular column writers, Agnes Callard would definitely
*  be on that list.
*  Callard is a philosopher at the University of Chicago.
*  She's the author of the book Aspiration, and she writes this wonderful public philosophy
*  column for the magazine The Point.
*  And I love that column.
*  Every one of them is just dense with insight on all kinds of different topics, status and
*  jealousy and parenting and arguing and anger, the things that we all live with.
*  It's a problem in the news that you don't really have a news peg every day to write
*  about what it means to be angry or what it means to be jealous.
*  But those are topics that all of us are dealing with every single day.
*  So her column, I find, is just a real model of how clear, precise philosophical thinking
*  can illuminate topics we already think we know well.
*  I just really get a lot out of it.
*  It's a joy to get to have her on the show.
*  And this is one of those ones, I know it's a cliche in podcasting or interviews, we cover
*  a lot of ground, but she writes about so many things that there is just vast territory that
*  we range over in this conversation.
*  But I do want to start and set you up for topics that we've covered before on the show,
*  which is how we define and communicate status and what are the merits of and the problems
*  with the so-called meritocracy.
*  Callard has really shaped how I view both of those topics, how I hear myself and others
*  in conversation and what the sort of meta level of what we're saying is doing.
*  And then how I try and parse the tension in the meritocracy debate between believing we're
*  not really responsible for most of how our lives turn out.
*  And so a philosophical or moral structure that blames us, particularly for our failures,
*  is unjust.
*  And yet it's also indispensable to have an idea in our own minds of excellence, to have
*  something to strive for, a way to shape our efforts to sharpen the instruments of ourselves.
*  And she just has a wonderful way of working through this debate.
*  So I think you're really going to enjoy it.
*  As well as my email, Ezra Kleinschow at nytimes.com.
*  Here's Agnes Callard.
*  So you have this fascinating column on status, and I want to start with how you define it.
*  What is status to you?
*  It's how much value other people accord you.
*  That's a good way of putting it.
*  So then you talk about the way we work through this in our everyday interactions.
*  And you talk about the basic game and the importance game and the leveling game.
*  Can you talk me through them?
*  Sure.
*  So the basic game is an attempt to find some common ground with a new person that you meet
*  in terms of interests or a place that you come from or people that you know.
*  It establishes that we care about at least some of the same things.
*  The importance game is a game of jockeying for status in which you try to be recognized
*  by your interlocutor at sort of the maximum importance level that they can recognize you
*  at.
*  So you want to give them all the facts that they would need to see how important you are.
*  And the leveling game is a game of finding common ground in feeling unimportant.
*  So you find a way to talk to someone in such a way that you can both share an experience
*  of powerlessness or struggle.
*  And in a way, it's a way of defecting from the importance game.
*  So model out a conversation for me.
*  Let's say you and I just met.
*  What might be things that one would say in a conversation that would establish each of
*  So I think one thing that's hard is that with both the sort of importance game and the leveling
*  game, there is an element of disguise.
*  We don't play them explicitly.
*  We do play the basic game explicitly.
*  We come pretty close to just being like, hey, let's find out what we have, what we're both
*  interested in.
*  Do you like this movie?
*  Right.
*  But the other two are disguised.
*  And so anytime they show up in a conversation, they kind of show up in.
*  You can't actually just say to someone, I'm going to explain to you why I'm important.
*  And you can't actually just say to someone, like, let's empathize with one another, something
*  like that.
*  You have to kind of do it by way of doing something else.
*  And so a way that I see this show up often in an academic context is sort of talking
*  about busyness.
*  Academics talk a lot about how busy they are.
*  And for a long time, this sort of puzzled me because I don't think we're the busiest
*  people.
*  But I think we talk about being busy more than any other group of people that I encounter.
*  And I think that what busyness allows you to do is it's a sort of it's a way of playing
*  both games at the same time.
*  So if I tell you that I'm really busy, I'm telling you that I feel stressed, I feel overworked,
*  I feel like I'm not in control of my life.
*  I have all these demands being made on me so you can empathize with me.
*  But at the same time, I'm also telling you that look at all these people who want a piece
*  of me, I'm pretty important.
*  And so I think that that's a big part of what makes the busyness an attractive topic for
*  people is that it allows them to play both those games at the same time.
*  And so how do you distinguish when these are about assessing relative status and when they're
*  just about creating common ground in conversation?
*  So if we're chatting and I did not go to Harvard, but we're talking and I let slip that I went
*  to Harvard, maybe I'm saying, hey, I went to Harvard.
*  Or maybe I'm just saying like that's where in fact I went to college.
*  Or on the flip, if we're then talking later and I say, oh, you know, I'm just totally
*  overwhelmed lately, you know, or I'm a really anxious person or I just find I just can't
*  even do simple things in my life and get them done lately.
*  Maybe I'm saying, you know, don't worry, even though I went to Harvard, I'm just like you.
*  Or maybe I'm just trying to turn to create a space for us to have a conversation.
*  So when is this a status game?
*  And when is it just, you know, human beings assessing their own experience, you know,
*  in concert with each other?
*  I think it is just deeply indeterminate all the time.
*  And it kind of has to be right.
*  So one thing you can do is you can be sort of a very charitable listener to people and
*  you can always try to hear only the basic game in the conversation.
*  And I know people who sort of do this, right.
*  Or you can be very, very attuned to these other two games, right, and always be responding
*  to that in the conversation.
*  I think that often, in fact, what we do is we combine the expectation of being heard
*  in the basic way with interpreting others in one of the other two ways.
*  So like, it's easy for me to think of myself.
*  Oh, I just happened to mention that I went to the University of Chicago or something
*  like that.
*  That is to hear in my own speech only the basic game, right, which is a kind of charitable
*  interpretation of myself, but then to be hypersensitized to the other person.
*  And I think that there's always going to be an interpretive ambiguity because the
*  leveling game and the importance game are always disguised.
*  So you argue that we do all of these games and all of this status-jogging in part because
*  we've left, to put it in new terms, important ethical theorizing undone.
*  What is the ethical theorizing here that is undone?
*  It's the question of what makes a human being valuable.
*  I mean, you can say, what makes a cup valuable?
*  Well, I can drink from it.
*  What makes the work of art valuable?
*  It's beautiful.
*  What makes some weather valuable or something?
*  It might be, well, it's pleasant to be in, or it might be it's good for the environment
*  or whatever.
*  There are all kinds of ways of talking about why something is valuable, but a human being
*  is a special case, right?
*  And we're very interested in what makes us valuable.
*  And I think that we have two basic answers to that question that we give, like, at a
*  philosophical level, but we're all giving those answers, which is, on the one hand,
*  What makes a human being valuable is a certain kind of dignity or inner worth that everyone
*  has simply in virtue of being human.
*  You have it from the moment that you're born or depending on your theory, maybe even before
*  you're born.
*  And nothing you do can lose it.
*  You can't lose it no matter what you do.
*  And everyone has it equally, right?
*  So that's like one kind of worth.
*  The other conception of value is of something acquired.
*  And in some of the philosophy that I work on, ancient Greek philosophy, Plato and Aristotle,
*  the word that's sometimes used for this is virtue, right?
*  So a virtue is a kind of excellence of a human being that they have to do stuff to get.
*  So you're not born with virtues.
*  You're not born being courageous.
*  You're not born with knowledge.
*  So the other account of what makes a human being valuable is like, well, it's the value
*  that they worked to acquire.
*  And you either acquire it or you don't.
*  And if you don't, you don't have it.
*  And so the first conception of value, you could think of it as like a moral safety net
*  that catches everybody, right?
*  And the second one is one where it's possible to lack it and it's possible to have it to
*  a greater or lesser degree.
*  Past societies have had much clearer status hierarchies.
*  And recently in America, you might say that we have a very intense one and it's hard to
*  social mobility, but we also try to hide it in all kinds of ways.
*  We have very complicated feelings towards it.
*  You have a great quote in this piece where you say, a recent acquaintance told me that
*  the least stressful new interactions in his life were in the army because status relations
*  were immediately evident and common knowledge.
*  You just looked at how many stripes the person had on his shoulder and that was that status
*  negotiations complete.
*  By contrast in the extra military world, confusion reigns.
*  Is there something about the way we relate to status hierarchies?
*  Like right now, today in modernity, this created an unusual level of confusion.
*  And is that a good or bad thing?
*  If so, I think the more social mobility you have, the more of this tension you'll have.
*  So if you think about Plato's Republic, okay, so in Plato's Republic, he creates this ideal
*  society.
*  And in the society, there's this thing he calls the noble lie.
*  The noble lie is that certain people have metals in their soul, bronze or silver or
*  gold.
*  And depending on what you have in your soul, you can either be like in the ruling class
*  or in the guardian class or in the sort of artisan class.
*  And what's so interesting to me about this is that Plato inverts the modern, the idea
*  that genetics is the hard truth.
*  Namely, he thinks the lie is that we have a kind of innate fundamental difference that
*  underwrites our social class.
*  The truth is that these differences aren't there, but we have to pretend that they're
*  there.
*  So in effect, we have to pretend that there are these fundamental genetic differences
*  that determine what class we're going to be in.
*  And why would Plato think that?
*  Well, if you think that the fact that you're not a ruler is because of some metal in your
*  soul that can't be changed because it's locked in you, then you're not going to try to be
*  one.
*  You're also not going to see the question of whether or not you can rule as determining
*  your sense of worth.
*  Your sense of worth is already there.
*  So Plato's society is one that's rigidly socially immobile.
*  And it does prevent a certain kind of strife.
*  And so in a way that's in contrast with what we have or think we have or talk about having,
*  which is a meritocracy, which is the idea that where you get is a reflection of your
*  of your work ethic, of your talents and how you've used them.
*  And you've done a lot of writing about this.
*  And there's been, particularly on the left in recent years, a real questioning of meritocracy.
*  I mean, it goes back further, but it's been Michael Sandel's written a book on it.
*  Dana Markovits has written a book on it.
*  And there's this idea that the meritocracy blames people for their failures, which makes
*  it in many ways immoral given the level of responsibility we do or don't have over our
*  life outcomes.
*  But on the other hand, the question of, well, isn't it good to give people something to
*  aspire to?
*  How do you parse that?
*  Yeah.
*  So one thing I've argued for is that at least ideally what would be nice is a non-punitive
*  meritocracy, right?
*  So you could think that the rewards that people get are the products of their efforts without
*  people who don't get the rewards are culpable or blameworthy.
*  And this is actually how we interact with people.
*  People find this weird to think about it this way politically, but it's exactly how we interact
*  with our friends, right?
*  So when our friends have some achievement, we don't say, oh, well, you started off lucky.
*  You know, of course, all our friends have various forms of luck, but we don't emphasize
*  those when they achieve something.
*  We say things like, well earned, you know, you deserved it.
*  This went to a great person.
*  This is all the time on Twitter when I see people getting things and I'm like happy for
*  them and I think it's great, right?
*  On the other hand, like when I have a friend, you know, get a paper rejected from a journal
*  or like happens to me all the time, we have various failures.
*  We don't, we might try to give them suggestions about like how to improve for next time, but
*  we don't say, well, this is your fault.
*  It's earned.
*  It's deserved, right?
*  We treat these cases asymmetrically.
*  In those cases, in the case of failure, we attend to all the outside influences.
*  And I think that kind of difference in attention makes sense.
*  And it's sort of ethically justified as a good way to treat people.
*  So when I read this argument from you, it made me wonder if I'm a bad friend.
*  That's the first take I had on it because you're completely right in how I talk to
*  and how my friends talk to each other, right?
*  Somebody does something great and we're like, hey, good for you.
*  You've worked so hard.
*  Then something bad happens to somebody.
*  It's like, oh my God, the world is cruel.
*  And oftentimes that is my view on the situation, but I don't think that's as ubiquitously true
*  as that makes it sound.
*  I think plenty of times within a friend group, there is somebody who, you know, the friends,
*  the various people think is like actually kind of screwing it up.
*  You know, they're being a bad partner in their marriage or they're not working hard at their
*  job.
*  And then when the consequences eventually come, you know, you're nice to people when
*  that happens and forgiving and sympathetic and, and they're with them.
*  But I don't think it's true that the way they often get looked at is quite so asymmetric.
*  That may be the way they're spoken to, but, but I'm not sure that's so deeply true.
*  And that makes me wonder if this is actually as easy a thing to do as you're talking about
*  that we do want to believe maybe only because it's self protective to ourselves that our
*  personal effort and personal decisions like have an outcome in life all the way up to
*  the way that when there's an aftermarket phenomenon that when you hear about somebody dying young
*  in the news that people immediately want to know why, right?
*  Were they a smoker?
*  Like, did they, you know, did they live in an unhealthy way because they want to say,
*  well, I'm not doing that.
*  So I'm not going to have this problem.
*  And so it does seem to be something kind of deep in our desire to blame people, even if
*  it's socially awkward to do it to their face.
*  And so we try not to do that, that there is a fair amount of blame that creeps even into
*  social relations.
*  Good.
*  So I think that, I mean, like one question is sort of, what is the correct ethical relation
*  you have to this person whose marriage is failing or their career is failing because
*  they're making some of the wrong choices?
*  And I tend to think that the correct ethical relation to that person is to try to help
*  them, right?
*  So you know, you might say, look, here's how I think you can do it better.
*  So is there any role for the punitive there?
*  Like it's your fault.
*  You brought this on yourself.
*  And I tend to think the answer is just no, there isn't anything to be gained by that.
*  And it might relieve a kind of psychological tension in oneself.
*  But you know, I don't think that the kind of meritocracy that I am trying to sketch
*  in this piece, the non-punitive meritocracy, I don't think it's easy.
*  So you say, is it maybe not as easy?
*  You say, I agree with you.
*  It's really not easy.
*  It's super tempting to want to think that in addition to success being justified, suffering
*  is also justified somehow.
*  And I think it's almost unbearably painful to us to face unjustified suffering.
*  As much as we say, like this is the case of the young person who dies, right?
*  As much as we might say, oh, life's not fair, bad stuff happens, that's just words.
*  We don't accept that.
*  On a deep level, we don't accept that that's possible.
*  I don't think it's only so it won't happen to me.
*  I think it's like, it's not permitted to happen.
*  It's not permitted for someone to experience profound suffering in a way that is not justified.
*  And there's something actually deeply philanthropic about being intolerant of that.
*  I think it's a really interesting point.
*  I mean, it makes me think of the God has a plan response to certain kinds of suffering,
*  which is to say that even if you can't feel how it is justified now, in some way it is
*  justified.
*  This is not my idea.
*  I heard it from somebody else, and I'm sorry, because I forgot who now.
*  But there's this argument that the book of Job would be more powerful if Job was not
*  restored at the end.
*  If at the end of his testings, God did not reward him for his steadfastness.
*  Because like what that is saying, of course, is still like all suffering is on some level
*  justified.
*  There will be a reward in the end.
*  And as you're saying, one of the difficult things about being a human being is it's not,
*  or at least we have no way of knowing that our suffering amounts to anything much.
*  And even our fundamental stories that try to acculturate us to the fact that suffering
*  can be beyond our understanding, it's still like at the end they swerve from that a little
*  bit and said, but we have enough understanding to say that there's somebody else with better
*  understanding, some other force.
*  And like that, there is a logic to that force.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it might not matter so much that Job gets rewarded.
*  That's not the part we remember.
*  It's not the part that speaks to us, right?
*  Like when Jesus says, God, why have you forsaken me?
*  Does it matter that later it presumably works out okay for Jesus in heaven or something?
*  It's like these moments in which the cry for the suffering to be explained, to be explained
*  right then immediately.
*  The fact that we can even tolerate that much is amazing.
*  And maybe you're right about the swerve.
*  I think that it's important to remember that the claim, oh, life's not fair, life's full
*  of suffering, we just can't justify it.
*  That's just another swerve.
*  That's not actually facing up to it.
*  The actual facing up to it is so painful that we can at best do it for a second under very
*  weird circumstances of like, just actually really, the only times I've ever really faced
*  homelessness was when I was like with my middle son and he would like, there was a
*  period in his life where we just had to go over to every homeless person we saw and not
*  just give them money, but like, there was this elaborate negotiation, like if they had
*  a dog, we had to give them money for the dog and we had to explain to them how much of
*  the money is for the dog.
*  And like later he'd talk about it, like it just wouldn't be over, you know, with a homeless
*  person, it's like you want to give them the money, then you want it to be over and it
*  would like never be over.
*  And I felt like I was facing this thing, this like unjustified suffering in a way that I
*  just normally don't.
*  I normally find a way around it, right?
*  So we find like a hundred ways around it, even when it's right in front of us.
*  One of the really profound and profoundly sad things in life is the way we learn to
*  close ourselves to suffering.
*  I find that story about your son very moving.
*  And I think there's a pretty common thing where children have not yet been taught how
*  to ignore what is obviously not right.
*  If you don't mind me asking, like, how did he grow out of that?
*  You say that was a time in the past and like and what did you think watching that end?
*  Were you on some level like grateful that it was over, that you didn't have to keep going
*  up to every homeless person on the street?
*  Or did you feel something was lost at that point in maybe his, but also your like ethical
*  relationship with the world?
*  So he is just someone of overwhelming natural empathy.
*  So like I'll come home and if there was something wrong, he'll just look at my face and be like,
*  what happened?
*  Right.
*  You can just sort of read it.
*  And I think for me, it was a relief because he has to learn how to one of his projects
*  in life is going to be to learn how to manage that empathy that just threatens to become
*  all that he is and consume him.
*  But I do think that in general, yeah, there is this process by which children, it's almost
*  like they move into, we move into a logic of what is deserved or what is earned or what
*  is owed and children are not yet in that space.
*  You know, I'll tell a little story about my other son, my oldest.
*  So this is my middle son with the homeless person, but my oldest son, I used to actually
*  avoid, we lived in Berkeley, California, and the playgrounds had toys, like they were sort
*  of covered with, you know, toys that people left there for the kids to play with.
*  And there was a period where he never wanted to go there except when other kids weren't
*  there, because here's how he put it.
*  The other kids take the toys away from me.
*  But here's what actually happened.
*  He'd be sitting there, he'd be digging with shovel or something, another kid would
*  walk up and she would maybe glance at the shovel and he would walk up to her and hand
*  her the shovel.
*  And his narrative of what happened was she took the shovel away from me.
*  Right.
*  And he was like, what's going on there?
*  Well, he could sort of see that she wanted it.
*  Right.
*  And he didn't want to give it to her, but he kind of felt like he had to or he didn't
*  know what's the rule for like when you have to.
*  Right.
*  He didn't know about property rights, you know, and I would be saying things to him
*  like it's your shovel, you don't have to share.
*  The other parents would be looking at me like it's obviously a playground shovel, you know,
*  I'd be like, just keep digging, you can ignore her.
*  Like, I would be saying things like that.
*  Right.
*  What am I trying to do there?
*  Like, I'm trying to give him a sense of the boundaries between himself and other people.
*  And I think children have to learn that.
*  And then it's really only when we're adults that we can sort of, I think, confront the
*  problem or the profundity of there being such a boundary.
*  That is such an interesting way to put it.
*  I just sometimes wonder if what we think of as a more mature, realistic way that adults
*  look at the world is just much less true to the reality that we live in.
*  Your story reminds me of this Louis CK riff where he talks about walking down the street
*  in New York with a cousin of one of his friends and she sees somebody just in terrible shape.
*  The person is homeless and they're in rags and they're ill and they're just not well,
*  right?
*  A person obviously in need of terrible help and she says we should help them.
*  Like, what should we do here?
*  He says, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Like that person is fine.
*  Right.
*  That person is exactly where they need to be.
*  And I mean, he knows what's going on here, right?
*  This is a point of his riff, but he is correcting her correct empathetic impulse to help her
*  correct understanding that what's going on there is unjust and she has some moral responsibility
*  towards it.
*  And it sometimes seems to me that a lot of becoming an adult is learning or being taught
*  to shut down that intuition of moral responsibility.
*  I know this is a big question in ethical philosophy broadly.
*  It's Peter Singer's parable about the pond that if you would walk by a child who seemed
*  to be drowning in a pond and jump in and ruin your suit and your shoes to save them, well,
*  why wouldn't you send the equivalent amount of money to save children in another country
*  who we know right now you could save by making that donation?
*  And there's like a real tension here between the filtering you need to do just to live
*  in this world.
*  But also, you know, you can really over filter that.
*  And then all of a sudden somebody who's simply on the wrong side of a line that means nothing,
*  except that, you know, 200 years ago there was a war and one side one and the other didn't,
*  like they just lose all moral value to you.
*  Obviously, it's a pretty deep question in philosophy.
*  But I'm curious like how you try to draw your line to somebody who thinks about this quite
*  a bit.
*  Yeah, I think that maybe one way to think about it is to sort of reverse the standard
*  almost like, you know, Hobbesian story about the state of nature being basic selfishness
*  and egoism.
*  Like, I don't see that when looking at children.
*  That is, so here's the story.
*  Prior to entering into civil society, each of us is egoistic and cares only about our
*  own needs and to such a degree that we're willing to do great violence to other people
*  in order to get what we want.
*  But we form this kind of agreement with other people to kind of respect their basic rights,
*  at least, so that they'll respect ours and so that we can have mutually beneficial agreements
*  through trade.
*  And we might set a sovereign over us to regulate that whole process.
*  So there's this, in effect, politics is overcoming the problem of egoism.
*  That's one story, right?
*  And a lot of political philosophy comes out of that and just believes that.
*  But sometimes I think it's exactly the wrong story.
*  That politics is overcoming the problem of altruism.
*  That at some basic level, we respond to the suffering of other people viscerally.
*  And we see it as just as much of a problem as our own suffering and the problem of causing
*  suffering to others.
*  My husband once said to me, he got a lot into a lot of fights as a teenager and he said,
*  What I learned was that it wasn't the strongest person who won the fight.
*  It was the one who was willing to do the worst kind of damage.
*  If you'll stick your finger in someone else's eye, you can win almost any fight with a 16
*  year old.
*  Right?
*  So we don't want to be brutal.
*  We don't want to act brutally towards one another.
*  We don't find it easy to ignore another person's suffering.
*  And civil society in some ways like creating a structure in which each of us can be individuals
*  and can limit the extent to which we attend to the suffering of others.
*  Oh, that is a very provocative thought.
*  So do you think that is an optimistic or a pessimistic way of thinking about civil society?
*  I think that it's optimistic because I think that the idea would be that as society progresses,
*  in effect, we can accommodate more and more of our natural altruism.
*  So the thing you spoke of where we have wars and we view the other side as an enemy, it's
*  sort of like, well, we have this thought that it's a condition on the survival of our society
*  that we close off our humanity to that group.
*  But as that becomes less of a condition on survival, we then just permit ourselves to,
*  in effect, activate our natural concern for one another.
*  So that's actually a very nice bridge back to meritocracy, which we've gone a little
*  bit afield of.
*  But it brings up this idea of the sort of principle versus the instrumental case for
*  the meritocracy.
*  So the principle case for meritocracy might be that it is the right way to structure society,
*  it's right to reward people and the people who are getting rewarded are the right ones.
*  But the instrumental case is this idea that we are trying to improve society, that the
*  is to give people something to aspire to, that we've structured the things they aspire
*  to in the correct way.
*  And that by rewarding them for that and blaming on some level those who don't, we are driving
*  society forward, getting technological innovations, managerial innovations, maybe even ethical
*  innovations.
*  And so generation to generation, we are being able to help more people and build something
*  better.
*  I think this has fallen very much out of favor on the left.
*  A lot of the critiques of meritocracy come at the idea that this doesn't work and it's
*  not principled and it hurts the people who fail out.
*  I do think there's something valuable to giving people ways to aspire to personal excellence.
*  I do think there's a deep point here that has to be the ultimate justification of meritocracy
*  if there is one, which is this.
*  You don't want people to be too happy with who they are too early in their lives, right?
*  Like a two year old should not be happy to remain a two year old.
*  They're great, you know, but they haven't encountered most of the really valuable things
*  in life yet, right?
*  So a really big part of life is coming to care about new things that you didn't even
*  know were valuable beforehand.
*  And we want people to do that.
*  And there's a there's a kind of problem with how people can do it because it's like it
*  doesn't seem valuable to them.
*  So why are they how are they going to start valuing it?
*  And competition is a really powerful psychological mechanism for that, right?
*  And so you see it in schools.
*  People want to get a good grade.
*  And because they want to get a good grade, they study.
*  And because they're studying, they sort of become immersed in our world.
*  And so we use competition to sort of leverage ourselves out of what would have been an impoverished
*  point of view on value.
*  And I think that that's got to be the ultimate justification of meritocracy.
*  But that justification is a justification only of meritocracy as being in a way to motivate
*  people.
*  It's not a justification of meritocracy as being a way to ultimately assess the value
*  of your life or what you care about.
*  It's sort of a theory of transition, not a theory of the end point.
*  And I think one of the really deep ways in which meritocracy gets corrupted is when people
*  take it to be a theory of the end point.
*  In effect, my view is if you are comparing yourself negatively to someone else, which
*  is I think a perfectly fine thing and a very useful thing to do, you better be in the process
*  of trying to become better.
*  If you're done in that respect, like suppose you look at your neighbor and they're wealthier
*  than you.
*  If that motivates you to try to become more wealthy, great.
*  But if all it does is create bitterness, then you've perverted meritocracy.
*  That is, you've taken something whose function was to motivate you to become better and you
*  have applied it in a situation which is static.
*  Well, wealth is, I think, a really important idea to draw in here because there's obviously
*  the question in any hierarchy or in anything you want to call meritocracy, which is, well,
*  what is the merit?
*  How are you measuring the merit?
*  I think that if you asked people conceptually, how do we measure merit?
*  You might get all kinds of answers.
*  Then I think if you actually look at it, it's just money.
*  The way the meritocracy works is you have won the meritocracy.
*  If you are a high up engineer at Facebook or you're at a high up position at McKinsey,
*  you might say to somebody, do you think a high up engineer at Facebook or a high up
*  executive McKinsey is doing more good for the world than a social worker who works with
*  hardcore addicts?
*  You'd say, no, of course not.
*  The social worker who works with hardcore addicts, that's a wonderful person, almost
*  a saint.
*  Then you might say, well, just look at society.
*  Which do we value more?
*  Who has more respect?
*  Who's going to have an easier time on the dating market?
*  Who's going to have an easier time having the things they want in life?
*  Of course, it's the people at the top of these big companies.
*  To your point earlier about ethical theorizing left undone, I think we've really lost any
*  conversation of what we are trying to incentivize people to change towards and then how we do
*  it.
*  We've just left it a little bit to the market.
*  Good.
*  So first of all, I disagree with you about wealth being the only measure of merit or
*  even the main one.
*  I think it is a big one.
*  So I think that with the advent of social media, just like number of Twitter followers
*  is for some people a measure of merit.
*  I think honors in academia, I can tell you that people care a lot about honors.
*  It's a very big deal to get tenure.
*  But then after you have tenure, this amazing thing happens, which is that there are still
*  these promotion levels that sort of don't mean anything, but people still care about
*  them.
*  They're like, oh, I want to be promoted to full professor.
*  I want to be promoted to university professor.
*  Yes, you make a little more money when you're promoted in those ways, but I don't think
*  it's the money that motivates people.
*  I think it's the honor.
*  And I think the social worker gets a certain kind of honor too.
*  I think that they know that they're chosen in examples like the one you just gave, right?
*  And they get to present themselves as a social worker.
*  And I do think that there is a certain cache to that.
*  I agree with you.
*  It isn't of the same order as the banker.
*  Why do so many students go into those lucrative professions?
*  Partly it's that money is a measure of merit.
*  Partly it is fear.
*  I think it isn't all them wanting the most honor, I think, or wanting to win the top
*  of meritocracy.
*  I think that students are worried about their survival and they feel they need to make prudent
*  choices or they won't survive.
*  And they feel like, so there's a certain amount actually, I think, of risk aversion in some
*  of the choices that are sort of guaranteed to lead to financial success.
*  On the one hand, there are questions about who do we want to be personally and what is
*  it to have value as a human being?
*  And then there's a question, how do you organize society so that in effect the right things
*  end up at the top?
*  And I don't think that we are crazy off with respect to that, but I think there's a lot
*  of room for improvement.
*  Money has this weird way.
*  It is a transferable form of achievement.
*  So there are honors within industries or Twitter followers, and they really work in their sort
*  of local space, but money kind of works everywhere.
*  And so that gives it, I think, a distinctive power.
*  It's one reason I wish we could attach money to things I think are a little bit more socially
*  valuable.
*  That's my fundamental critique of the market.
*  I just think it often rewards the wrong things because we leave it too much to its own devices.
*  I don't think scarcity is always the right way to measure these things.
*  This is in many ways a left-wing critique of the way the meritocracy works.
*  But when I read the left-wing critiques of the way the meritocracy works, a place I feel
*  uncomfortable is that I feel like the left, in trying to critique the meritocracy so much,
*  has sort of lost an idea of excellence, of what is it you're supposed to be striving
*  for.
*  There's a sort of negative version of it.
*  You want to rid yourself of racist ideas and bias and toxic misogyny and so on.
*  That's good, and we should rid ourselves of those things.
*  But you also need the positive version, right?
*  Who are you trying to become?
*  You know, to your point about aspiration, and I guess I'll frame it this way.
*  I think a lot about what is a left-wing version of Jordan Peterson look like, you know, or
*  at least Jordan Peterson from a couple of years ago.
*  You know, what would that look like?
*  Because I think you do need that.
*  I think he speaks to something deep in people.
*  You're not good enough yet, and you need to get better.
*  And here's how you do it.
*  So let me ask that of you.
*  Like, what would a left-wing Jordan Peterson be?
*  One version of it is sort of the idea that anti-racism could be turned into an excellence.
*  I think we used to think, well, there's just not being racist.
*  And like, being racist is horrible.
*  And so it's sort of like being like a murderer or something and like, just don't do that.
*  And then you're fine, right?
*  But I think that, so one, this is one version, is already sort of exists.
*  And it is the idea that like, concern for the oppressed and the powerless is itself
*  something that can be perfected and that you can be competitive at and be better at than
*  other people.
*  It's not super attractive as a vision, I think, but it is something like that.
*  In effect, Jordan Peterson's a really interesting case because he is dealing with this sort
*  of problem of the zero-sum game of self-respect, right?
*  Where it's like people feel like they're losers.
*  And he is pushing that in a left-wing direction by saying everyone can have self-respect,
*  right?
*  You can, yes, improve yourself, but you can do it by cleaning your room or something that
*  everyone can do, right?
*  So that's how he incorporates a certain kind of egalitarianism into his approach.
*  And similarly, I think that the left-wing version of that would incorporate a certain
*  kind of competitiveness.
*  So, the core of this conversation, as you said earlier, is the way we give people incentives
*  to shape themselves.
*  And you have a line that's always stuck with me, which is that the process of self-creation
*  involved a fair amount of violence to myself.
*  When we're creating ourselves and changing ourselves, what is the nature of that violence?
*  I think it's that you have certain instinctive responses and you can't trust them.
*  And you even have to sometimes silence them.
*  And the sort of very mundane version of that is like cases of weakness of will where you're
*  like, I shouldn't eat this extra cookie or whatever, right?
*  There's just a thing that we do to ourselves kind of all the time where we, it's like we're
*  whipping ourselves into shape, right?
*  Where we are denying our own desires.
*  Those desires are judgments about goodness, right?
*  So some part of me is saying, this cookie is good.
*  And I'm telling her, you're lying.
*  That's a kind of violence to the self, I think.
*  And in the cookie case, maybe it's not so serious, right?
*  But in the case of, you know, like, I don't know, early teenage sexual desires and the
*  kind, if you think about the kind of self-monitoring and self-criticism that we do about that,
*  you know, certainly more so if somebody is homosexual and living in a less tolerant community.
*  But I think it's just true of everyone that there's a kind of being grossed out by your
*  own desires and there's a kind of feeling of needing to hide them and needing to shape
*  them and needing to tell them that they're making false judgments.
*  I think it's really interesting, this question of what is our desire?
*  The voice in our head saying, we don't want to eat the cookie or I don't want to spend
*  today on Twitter or, you know, I want to work out more.
*  I want to spend an hour every morning reading books or the more guttural, intuitive, like,
*  I do want to look at Twitter.
*  I want to sleep in.
*  I don't want to read the book.
*  How do you think about that conflict between, like, what that voice in our head says we
*  want and then what we do?
*  I think we're way too quick to identify ourselves with the long-term goals, especially when
*  we're not in the moment of being tempted.
*  So we can say, look, I know how I should really live.
*  I know that I should really read those books and I should not eat the cookies and I should
*  be less stressed about these things and I should spend more time with my family.
*  These are things I know.
*  And I think the truth is that I do not know any of them.
*  I believe them and then I also believe the opposite.
*  And there are some of my beliefs are in a way, like, more presentable to other people,
*  right?
*  I am more presentable to you if I say, yeah, I know I should really spend more time with
*  my kids than if I say, I have a profound need to escape my kids.
*  But both of those things are true of me.
*  And I think that the violence to the self occurs as long as they are both true of you.
*  I think, but this is sort of me just agreeing with Socrates about something, which is that
*  if you had knowledge, you would not have that conflict.
*  And a lot of people have the goal of mastering themselves, which is to say of exerting enough
*  violence over themselves to silence, to quiet that other voice because they know, they say
*  they know the other thing, right?
*  But the truth is that the fact that the other voice is there means you don't know it.
*  And the violence over yourself is the kind of trying to quiet it when it's really there.
*  Knowledge would mean that you unanimously and obviously and in a very simple way did
*  the thing you thought you should.
*  So I'm trying to think through the implicit definition of knowledge or knowing something
*  here.
*  It seems like a much more embodied way of knowing something than our typical way of
*  talking about knowledge.
*  Weirdly, I almost feel like our typical way of talking about knowledge is very bodily.
*  But maybe that's just my sort of Socrates.
*  So I think that maybe here's why I would put it that other way.
*  Suppose that I feel like having the cookie, but I know I shouldn't.
*  I think people are inclined to think of the feeling that you have the cookie as bodily
*  and knowing that you shouldn't as not being bodily.
*  I think that's bodily too.
*  That's just how things look to you in a bodily way when you're looking at them from far away.
*  Right?
*  You are somebody who is just trapped in the images of things.
*  And when you look at something like eating a cookie from close up, it looks really good
*  to you.
*  When you look at it from far away, it looks like it's not very good.
*  And those are both bodily judgments.
*  There's just proximate and distant bodily judgments.
*  And what we do when we don't have knowledge is we just vacillate between these bodily
*  judgments and we dress one of them up as though it were knowledge, namely the distant one.
*  If you actually knew in your soul, I would say, then the bodily judgments would be like
*  a play of images that you would ignore.
*  So if somebody says, if I say to you, well, here's two piles of money, this one has $1,000
*  and this one has $100, but the $100 one is taller because it's different denominations.
*  So it looks bigger.
*  But if you know that this one's $1,000, you're going to go for the $1,000.
*  You won't be like, well, that one's bigger.
*  And so there's a way in which we are fooled by images because all we're doing is like
*  in some sense doing what we feel like at every moment.
*  And to have knowledge would be to just not be subject to those images.
*  Why would knowledge resolve conflict as opposed to making it clear that there's always going
*  to be conflict, which is to say, you know, maybe, I might ask this question correctly,
*  maybe simply things in their opposite are true, which is something I see a lot in your
*  work actually, a kind of like recognition of living in the conflict of things.
*  Why would it be true knowledge to resolve conflicts as opposed to true knowledge to
*  say the conflicts are the truth of it?
*  So I think the difference there is in just in thinking how far from knowledge we are.
*  So I think the way I am is that I see a bunch of conflicts and I don't know how to resolve
*  them.
*  And that's just my ignorance.
*  If I had knowledge, I would know how to resolve them.
*  But what I at least try to do is to not be under the illusion that I have the knowledge
*  already.
*  To say knowledge would involve resolving them is to acknowledge that we are very, very,
*  very far from that.
*  It's not clear that it's achievable within a human lifetime.
*  But it is.
*  And so there's a different question, which is like, how do we make do without knowledge?
*  Right?
*  And we have to do some of that.
*  But once you sort of see it that way, nothing can really look as attractive to you as just
*  having knowledge.
*  Like you have to make do without it while you're looking for it.
*  But I guess I think the whole like living with contradictions, accepting contradictions
*  thing is just, it's a way of swerving.
*  It's a way of dressing up your own ignorance as being somehow responsibility and realism.
*  But I think I can see what it would be to know.
*  And it would be something amazing that's like way better than where I am.
*  I like that, at least as a goal.
*  So one way people try to get to that kind of knowledge is by asking other people for
*  advice.
*  And you have a wonderful column on the problems of advice.
*  So I want to begin with the distinction you draw between coaching and instruction and
*  giving advice.
*  Can you talk me through that?
*  Yeah.
*  So in this piece, I'm sort of using the word advice in a slightly limited way.
*  I think naturally it sort of occupies a broader territory.
*  But I'm thinking of sort of what I was motivated by just listening to a lot of podcasts, right?
*  And in which people are often asked to give generic advice to people who want to be like
*  them.
*  And the people on the podcast were always these like really idiosyncratic, weird people
*  who you feel sure that they did not become that person by following someone else's advice.
*  So there was some kind of a performative contradiction there of like, why don't you give people a
*  recipe for becoming the person who you could never have a recipe and then become that person.
*  But here are some things I think you can do.
*  So I think you can give people instrumental factual knowledge about how to achieve some
*  technical goal, right?
*  So if there's something where I don't know how to do it, like how do you get to this
*  place?
*  How do you operate the photocopier?
*  Then you can explain that to someone.
*  And the reason you can explain it to them is you don't need to know their bigger life
*  goals and motivations and values in wanting to get to that place or wanting to operate
*  the photocopier.
*  You can know a relatively limited amount about them and still help them.
*  That's one kind of thing, instruction.
*  I think coaching, what I mean by coaching is a kind of intimate long-term relationship
*  in which you become familiar enough with someone's goals that you're almost like an appendage
*  of who they are, but you're a little bit better attuned to those goals and you can sort of
*  nudge them in that direction.
*  There was a wonderful piece in the New York Times like yesterday or the day before about
*  gymnasts, older gymnasts, and people going back to the sport, people who've been told
*  that they're too old and they can't do it anymore, and the relationships they have with
*  their coaches by contrast with the younger gymnasts, right?
*  Where the older gymnasts, their coaches are less tyrannical and are more like extensions
*  of themselves.
*  And coaching is something I do lots of in my life because I do lots of advising of different
*  kinds of undergraduates, of graduate students, of mentoring colleagues, et cetera.
*  So I think that's totally possible.
*  But what I don't think is possible is that you can tell some stranger how to live where
*  that is understood in some very abstract way of like there's a good life and you're going
*  to help them achieve it.
*  Because I think that in order to help someone achieve big goals, like the coaching style,
*  you have to know who they are.
*  And I think you can help people achieve small goals, like how do you work the photocopier?
*  But that's not what the advice is geared to.
*  So I see advice as in this existing in this incoherent space between trying to help someone
*  in a big way who you don't know.
*  So this is really interesting to me.
*  So is part of what you're saying here that for these more profound kinds of, now I don't
*  want to use the word advice or instruction for this, but these more profound kinds of
*  direction, you know, how do I become a great writer?
*  How do I become a better person?
*  To make some of these changes that are more difficult for people to make, that if it's
*  going to happen, it has to be grounded relationally, that you have to know the person and have
*  a thing.
*  And what's happening in advice is you're trying to offer that kind of guidance, but non-relationally.
*  And so it's untethered from the sort of soil it needs to be rooted in to mix a metaphor
*  in order to take hold.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  Maybe another way to put it would be, I don't think becoming a great writer is a coherent
*  goal.
*  I think what you want to become is the particular kind of great writer that you can become,
*  whatever that is, and you don't know what it is, right?
*  That's what your goal is.
*  And you know, who can help me with that?
*  Well, like my editor, because she has some sense of who I am and of who that great writer
*  is that I'm trying to be.
*  But I think that trying to become a great writer in the abstract is a non-goal.
*  One way I describe it in my book is that sort of having aspiration that is too open-ended,
*  or just be flailing, like people who go to Europe to find themselves.
*  I mean, something fun might happen, but most likely they're not going to find anything
*  at all because that goal is not concrete enough.
*  And so I think that what coaching does is it allows people to help you with a more concrete
*  goal, becoming sort of the best gymnast you can be, where you can be is actually filled
*  in with a certain kind of person that is known to you and the coach.
*  My intuition is something similar to what you said at the beginning of this part of
*  which is that podcasting is a unusually advice centric form of media that compared to what
*  happens on the television or in a newspaper or even in books that like even things that
*  you don't think are going to be about advice.
*  They you know, it's like everything asymptotically approaches just a bunch of advice on how to
*  live.
*  Why do you think podcasting has evolved in that way or lends itself so much to advice?
*  I think it's because it's the leveling game part of podcasting.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  So podcasting in effect is elevating the interlocutor, right?
*  You're important enough for me to invite to a podcast.
*  And now the whole world, whoever listens to the podcast is in effect elevating that person
*  and being like, here's this important person, right?
*  And you know, a huge part of the world that we live in in the social media world is like
*  being approachable.
*  I think the advice part is mostly the function of it isn't to actually give advice, it's
*  to make the that person seem approachable or like wanting to help all the people who
*  might otherwise resent them for being in some way about them.
*  So a lot of Internet advice, although obviously not all of it, ends up revolving around
*  relationships, which I'm going to use as a segue to a fascinating piece you wrote about
*  jealousy, of which you have a pretty unusual take on it, which is that you say it's a positive
*  emotion. How is jealousy a positive emotion?
*  By positive, I don't mean, say, praiseworthy or good.
*  I mean, I leave that aside as to whether it is or not.
*  What I mean by positive is that it is a form of desire or attraction rather than a form
*  of aversion or fear, say.
*  Right. So we could classify emotions into whether the emotion is pulling you towards
*  something or whether it's pulling you away from something.
*  And I think jealousy is pulling you towards something.
*  What it's pulling you towards, though, is the love that someone could never have for
*  you, the love that they have for someone else.
*  Right. So I think that many people, me certainly, but I think maybe most people are in
*  some way erotically attracted to that very love, the very love they can never have, the
*  love that is in some way defined as being the love for somebody else.
*  And I think that part of why we find that so attractive is that if you love someone
*  and you it's like who you are for them, that's so limiting in some way.
*  Like, this is who I am and I'm loved as this.
*  And what if I want to be loved as someone else, too?
*  Like, what if I like like if you see the relationship as a very central sort of like
*  metaphysically defining thing for who you are, then it can feel frustrating and limited
*  to only be loved as yourself.
*  Do you think there's a version of that, too, where you want the version, not the love
*  exactly the person has for someone else, but the version of them they are with someone
*  else? Like, if you if you love someone, you want to know them and the sense that there's
*  a part of them you cannot know because it is a part of them that emerges in a different
*  dynamic with a different person.
*  And so you can never have it.
*  That's always struck me as a very deep part of jealousy.
*  That's a great point. And I don't touch on it at all in the piece that I wrote, but I
*  think you're right. When I think about times I've been jealous, I have wanted to know
*  about the character of the conversations that my beloved was having with his other
*  beloved. Right.
*  Where it's like, I want access to the you that you are for them.
*  And so it's a kind of and what that speaks to is a kind of bottomless desire to own
*  them. I want to own everything about you, even the parts of you that don't exist for
*  me.
*  Yes, it's I think there's something very real there always has been for me at least.
*  And you get a small taste of it when you go out in public with your partner, you go to a
*  dinner party and you see a version of them.
*  You're like, wait, like yesterday we were just hanging out and where was this version of
*  you? And then you realize, like wherever it was, it wasn't there in part because of me.
*  And like, that's a terrible feeling.
*  That is a big part of why people like going to dinner parties with their partners.
*  Like, I think jealousy is integrated at a low level into most romantic relationships and
*  it brings people pleasure.
*  Like to see their partner being desired by others, kept at a certain simmer or something.
*  Even though they feel jealousy and even though there's some kind of painful emotion, they
*  want that pain.
*  They want some of that pain.
*  I think that's a very real point.
*  I am not a very jealous person, but to the extent I sometimes get a bit jealous, I
*  definitely find it to be a pleasurable emotion.
*  Now, that might be because it's happening within an overall context of security.
*  It would not be pleasurable.
*  And I've had other relationships where it's not been pleasurable because it was happening
*  outside of a context of security.
*  But inside a context of security, I find it to just be a little exciting, right?
*  This recognition of unexplored vistas, this recognition that there's something unknown that
*  is like changing my relationship with my partner.
*  It can be fun.
*  And it gets to another line you have in that same piece for you, right?
*  I've never understood how polyamory is supposed to survive erotic rivalry, but I have
*  exactly the same objection to monogamy.
*  Tell me why those aren't more different for you.
*  Yeah, because in some sense, the problem is the same, namely in the case of polyamory,
*  you're always going to want the love that let me just throw some genders in there, right?
*  So that he has for another woman, right?
*  You want that love, right?
*  And so that's the jealousy that threatens to undermine the system.
*  But in the case of monogamy, you also want the love that he has for another.
*  It may not be embodied in another person, right?
*  At the moment, though, it threatens to be at every moment and at every dinner party,
*  there's that potential, right?
*  And so if you want the love that he has for another, whether or not that slot is filled,
*  that's a problem.
*  Yeah, in some way, I know polyamorous couples and one of the things I will sometimes hear
*  from them is that it's demystifying of that love, that in some ways it is less threatening
*  to see your partner go out and then watch them come back and they're just the same person.
*  And in some cases, like a little dissatisfied and tired the next morning, as opposed to
*  wondering what it is they want that you cannot give them, right?
*  That it is a like that acculturation removes it of some of its mystical power.
*  Yeah, good. And I mean, I would sort of think then that you'd have to find some way to
*  demystify. That is, if I'm right, that jealousy is kind of written in some deep way
*  into the erotic relationship, right?
*  That it's not just like we kind of need jealousy.
*  There's a kind of flatness to love without the possibility of it.
*  Right. And so you don't most worry that the polyamorous relationship that got too
*  demystified would sort of be like the monogamous relationship in which nothing could
*  even get noticed at the dinner party.
*  Let me ask about this from the other side, which is what makes for a good divorce?
*  I mean, I think most divorces are probably good divorces in the sense that very few
*  people get divorced out of compulsion or necessity.
*  Almost everyone chooses it because it's the best course, right?
*  But that doesn't mean that there are always pursuits as well as possible.
*  Well, sometimes one of the partners doesn't want to get divorced.
*  I'm not sure how to think about that sort of case.
*  I mean, I suppose you're right that there could be a relationship.
*  You could be in a relationship where the other person, where someone doesn't want to
*  be with you, but you still want to be with them.
*  And it could be that given a set of bad options, that's somehow still your best option.
*  But that would be like a very bad case.
*  I would think that it would be hard to persistently want to be with somebody who
*  really didn't want to be with you.
*  I think in those cases, and I'm no expert on divorce, but I think in those cases, it's
*  more that you are shocked and on some level disbelieving that the person doesn't want
*  to be with you. You either wish it weren't true or you think it will become untrue again.
*  Right. Right. You think they're going through a thing.
*  Right. And this is a bad idea.
*  And like, let's just like take a breath here and give it five or ten or 15 or 50 years
*  and see how you feel then.
*  Yes, I got that advice a lot when I got divorced because I did it very quickly and people
*  like, wait, let's deliberate.
*  So I think that that's a very good point.
*  So one person might just think like over time we can figure this out and the other person
*  thinks that we can't figure this out.
*  I think you're right. That's a real case where there's a disagreement over whether we
*  can sort of work something through or not.
*  And the person who thinks that we could, the divorce would just be a genuine loss.
*  But even in the case where there's agreement, which is most of the divorces I know of, that
*  at the end of the day, there's sort of agreement on that question, I guess I think that
*  maybe there's actually little more to a good divorce than the ability to continue to
*  proceed by agreement.
*  So like marriage is proceeding by agreement, right?
*  It's like you deliberate together with your spouse about how to live.
*  And I think you can continue to do that through a divorce and after a divorce.
*  And the question might just be how much of your lives continue to be shared, which like
*  if you shared kids, it's going to be a fair amount.
*  But I think that there is this thought that and maybe it's rooted in the very problem
*  that you just described about the person who wants to keep trying and the person who
*  doesn't, that divorce marks the end of deliberating together.
*  And I think if it does, then that's going to cause a lot of pain because if in some
*  sense, we deliberating together is how we act together with one another's consent.
*  And if we can't do that, we're going to have to do it together.
*  And if we can't do that, we're going to be sort of routinely doing certain kinds of
*  violence to one another and we're going to be operating using sort of threats and
*  incentives. So, yeah, I would say it's the ability to deliberate together.
*  So I ask you this because from what I can tell on social media and podcasting, you
*  have an unusually successful divorce.
*  You celebrate your divorce aversary, or at least some of them.
*  I obviously cannot, given our earlier conversation, ask you for your advice for
*  divorcing couples. But there's a specific thing you said, which is about creating
*  space for deliberation. So I'm curious what have been for you the successful spaces
*  for post-marriage deliberation?
*  Well, so one thing is like I talk to my ex-husband a lot about philosophy.
*  He's one of my best interlocutors.
*  And that is important because it's not the case that we're always deliberating
*  together. Like, there's another thing we do together that isn't deliberating
*  together. It's inquiring together.
*  And maybe that creates a certain kind of backdrop of goodwill, I guess, that is
*  relevant to deliberating together.
*  But I think that it's something like suppose there's some important decision that
*  needs to be made about kids' school or about let's pick that, right, something
*  about the kids. I think the key to deliberating well with him has been not to
*  think that I can settle that question on my own in my head and then try to sell
*  him that plan as being the right plan.
*  It's immediately obvious to someone when you're doing that.
*  That is, persuasion is not the right tactic.
*  Persuasion is much less commonly the right tactic than people suppose, I think.
*  So it's not I should actually figure out what we should do with his help, where I
*  think there are important pieces of the puzzle that are unavailable to me until I
*  talk to him.
*  That's just good. Oh, man, I can't say good life advice.
*  That's good life instruction.
*  This is a very specific thing that one could put into practice often between
*  marriage and divorce, although often outside of marriage to people of kids.
*  I have a two year old and you wrote an essay.
*  It's not that long after I had a child about the panic of parenting, which I love.
*  And I've sent to other people of children.
*  But you talk in there about something that has just felt truer and truer to me every
*  day, which is it.
*  It really shouldn't be called parenting.
*  It should be called childing.
*  Can you tell me why?
*  Yeah, I think maybe the core thought there is that parenting suggests that you make
*  your child into something.
*  And that's just not the truth.
*  It's more like your child is trying to figure out who they should be and you're
*  trying to help them without knowing what that is.
*  And I think that it's hard before you before I became a parent anyway, like I
*  didn't get how sort of psychologically difficult it would be to in some sense,
*  like, stand by and watch.
*  And it means every time you have an expectation for your child and you cannot
*  avoid having expectations, you also question it and say, am I having the right
*  expectation for him?
*  Is this the expectation I should be having?
*  Because you want it's not one direction of fit.
*  It's not like your child should meet your expectations, right?
*  You want to have the ones that are the right ones for him.
*  And so there's this direction of fit from you to your child that means that you are
*  constantly second guessing and questioning yourself as a parent.
*  And that it feels like I mean, my kids a little bit young for this at this point, but
*  but from the older parents, I know at times from my own parents and that it feels like
*  a failure that you have failed them if their lives or even in a local way, their
*  year, their month doesn't turn out the way they want it to.
*  Right. It does seem to me that the agony of parenting is believing that you can
*  control things you cannot control.
*  But also it would be very agonizing to think I was doing this without any control,
*  right? Any influence.
*  You know, how do you how do you think about that?
*  That desire to like, what are you doing parenting?
*  Point of all this.
*  So I like that point about failure.
*  Like I I gave that example earlier about my kid not wanting to go to the playground to
*  play because the other kids took the toys away from him.
*  And, you know, I struggled with him and I would give him these speeches about how it's
*  yours, don't share it. But eventually I just gave in and we would just go to the
*  playground really early when there weren't any other kids.
*  There was like a year when we just did that.
*  Right. Just to avoid the conflict.
*  Right. And I was thinking to myself, I'm not like educating him.
*  I'm not teaching him that he's supposed to hold on to stuff.
*  And I saw it as a failure.
*  But I'm like, this is my compromise.
*  I'm just going to not get into the situation.
*  And of course, it worked out fine.
*  Right.
*  But I think that that failure is necessary as part of the story.
*  I think what you're doing as a parent is you're coming up with goals for your kid
*  constantly and you're just making them up and you're making them up partly on the
*  basis of like stuff you hear from other people and, you know, stuff you hear from
*  your parents and stuff you read in some book.
*  But you're like, here's how his life should be.
*  Right. And then you insofar as you fall short of that, you feel bad and you
*  readjust and you come up with some new goal and you're constantly doing that.
*  You're constantly making up fake goals.
*  And I think it's because if you didn't do that, you wouldn't know what else to do.
*  Right. It's like the way you can see that so clearly is with infants.
*  Right. It's amazing.
*  If you look at the way people deal with infants, they treat a bunch of stuff that
*  isn't obviously not important as being super important.
*  Right. Whether the child is fed with breast milk or formula, whether the child,
*  how they sleep, how often they sleep, what even what kind of clothes, whether their
*  clothing is organic or not, whether they, you know, when they are toilet trained.
*  There are all these details about infant life that parents obsess over.
*  And you might look at that saying, I looked at it actually saying like people are nuts.
*  Like none of these things are important.
*  They just don't matter at all.
*  Right. But you have to care about something.
*  Right. You need some kind of goal.
*  And I think that parenting is this process where slowly you learn to have the right
*  goal for your kid, to have the goal that actually matters.
*  And you have to start out with dumb goals that don't matter, like how they're born
*  and how they're swaddled and etc.
*  But you're almost like triangulating until you come to the goal for them that is their
*  goal. That's such an interesting way of putting it.
*  I was thinking about what you were saying that was so I did very poorly in school
*  starting in seventh grade.
*  Like it was junior high.
*  Like I remember the class where I got my first D and from there through to when I was
*  some probably 13 there, something like that, from there to sort of the end of high
*  school, like until my senior year, my grades, for whatever reason, get a little bit
*  better. And also it's over one way or the other.
*  It was just a constant source of really difficult tension between me and my parents and
*  disappointment for them. They wanted me to get better grades.
*  Frankly, I wanted me to get better grades and I just couldn't for whatever reason.
*  It was not a lack of trying.
*  And the strange thing is it all worked out.
*  Right. Looking back from where I am now, like I'm a New York Times columnist, I have a
*  job. It's all fine. Like I went to college.
*  It all worked out. But of course, they couldn't have known that.
*  And I couldn't have known that.
*  And so in a way, the goal was wrong at that time.
*  And it caused everybody a lot of service to use the Yiddish word.
*  But it's not like I can fault like the goal seemed right.
*  Like it's not like I thought they were wrong about being mad at me about my terrible
*  grades. And so sometimes with this kind of way of looking at parenting, it becomes this
*  real difficult question of like, how do you like, how do you read tension?
*  You know, I think about this with again, like I have a very young toddler, so he can't
*  learn much from me and discipline yet.
*  So it's like, OK, like I'm just trying to avoid tension.
*  And I sometimes succeed and fail this morning because we did not have the right kind
*  of juice. There's nothing I could do about it.
*  But. You know, to what you're saying, like one way of looking at it is like, yeah, just
*  like chill a little bit as a parent.
*  Do you do you believe that to be true or do you think that it's actually good to take
*  your best guess of the goal and and that the tension, you know, creates something
*  valuable in the conflict?
*  I think it's very hard to know.
*  I will. I'm reflexively averse to the goal of chill.
*  Like, I think nobody ever believes that people say it.
*  Nobody believes it. Nobody acts upon it.
*  I do think it's important for your kid to see that you care who they become.
*  And having that tension is a way for that care to manifest itself.
*  Part of what you're doing is like, you know, being your kid's super ego in some way,
*  you're maintaining your you're holding a place for their conception of who they're
*  going to be. And you want that to be big and expansive.
*  And you want it to be much bigger than a toddler or an eight year old or a 12 year old
*  or 17 year old as my kids are.
*  Can't imagine you want it to take up more space than that.
*  You want them to expect a lot of themselves.
*  And part of how you're doing that is by expecting a lot of them.
*  How do you think about the question of setting good goals for oneself or anyone else?
*  A through line of our whole conversation here is about goals, right?
*  The goals the meritocracy sets for us, the goals we set for ourselves aspirationally,
*  the goals we set for our children.
*  And then also how often those goals can be wrong.
*  They're not true to who we really are or how things actually work out.
*  So you've clearly done a lot of thinking about goals.
*  How do you set goals for yourself?
*  So, I mean, one thought that I have about goals in general is that you can get much
*  less far ahead of yourself than you think you can.
*  So that's part of the illusion of what I said, the sort of the fact that the judgment
*  from a distance is also a bodily judgment.
*  It's like if I have this goal of like, I want to, I don't know, read a lot of more books
*  or something, then I can almost convince myself that I'm already the person who cares about
*  that. Right.
*  But if I were, then I would be doing it.
*  And so I think in myself, the way that I live that out is that there's a lot of randomness
*  in what I do. I'm like constantly exploring new avenues that where this might be me trying
*  to become a different person, but I never really know because if I were, this would
*  just be the first step and I would be confused about it.
*  So I think that's like taking up a lot of hobbies and like kind of starting new projects
*  and then a lot of them fail where like I don't have big abstract long term goals, except
*  in so far as it's something like I have philosophical projects and I want to like bring it to
*  a conclusion wherever that will be.
*  So there's yeah, there's a lot of like random movement.
*  That makes sense to me.
*  Let me ask you a question I don't realize I'd be asking you, but now that I'm actually
*  able to see you here and the audience can't, but you have a lot of color on behind you
*  is one of the most colorful walls I've ever seen.
*  I see a lot of cacti with eyes, flowers, possibly real.
*  I can't actually tell.
*  What is your relationship with color and like visual stimulation?
*  I need a lot of visual stimulation all the time.
*  So actually, my office hasn't always looked like this.
*  It actually used to like when I first got my job, this is my university office.
*  It was like a regular office.
*  This is your university office I'm looking at?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, wow.
*  This is at your home.
*  No, it's very cool.
*  And people can actually find pictures of this online.
*  I realize now.
*  Yes, it's on my actually my Twitter page.
*  It's like the background photo or something.
*  So you can see it.
*  Yeah.
*  When we actually had a fire in the philosophy department a few years ago.
*  So this is the second instantiation because it was destroyed.
*  But when they came in here, the whatever insurance people came in here after the fire,
*  they were so confused by the room and they were like, is this some kind of therapy room?
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm actually puzzled by other people who don't have a lot of color.
*  Like like the clothing with a lot of color on it pretty much costs the same as the clothing
*  with very little color on it.
*  So I'm confused by why people aren't making what to me is the obviously superior choice.
*  But I just color is amazing.
*  It's one of the most amazing features of the world.
*  We could have lived in an uncolored world, right?
*  A lot of the features of our world would still be in place.
*  But there's just this element of beauty that is out there of beauty and order and pattern
*  and contrast.
*  And it's like I want to experience it all the time.
*  And I was starting to say that I my office used to be normal and I found myself actually
*  Googling colors on my Googling the word color on my computer just to look at colors.
*  And I'm like, this is ridiculous.
*  I should like have some color math.
*  So I like I had like one of these tapestries, actually not these ones, but the pre fire
*  versions. And then I was like, oh, this is awesome.
*  Let me add something else. Let me add something.
*  I have the ceiling. My whole ceiling is covered too.
*  You can't see it. And yeah, my my like my husband, my kids would come in and they'd be
*  like, OK, but now you're done.
*  Right. They keep saying that.
*  And but I keep finding new spots where I can add stuff.
*  And to me, it's like one of the most obvious arenas in which maximization makes sense.
*  Like most things you shouldn't try to maximize.
*  You shouldn't try to maximize how much money you make.
*  You shouldn't try to maximize how much honor you get.
*  But I don't see why you shouldn't try to maximize how much colors in your life.
*  So this color and then there's like visual stimulation.
*  And I think the thing you'd normally hear from people think I would immediately think
*  is it would be distracting.
*  You'd be looking around and like you'd always be like caught on something.
*  And I end up when I'm writing, I have to clean my desk really intensely.
*  And, you know, there's nothing on it.
*  And I would actually like more color in my room.
*  But but I tend to have very clean workspaces.
*  So do you find that it like leads to a different quality of thinking?
*  Or is it just a context in which you think best?
*  Like you clearly don't find like busyness in the visual field to be distracting.
*  But but what is it for you?
*  I like being distracted, I think.
*  That's kind of the randomness I was describing, right?
*  You can't segregate randomness like that.
*  It has to be available to you at every moment of your life that you might start doing
*  something else. It creates some persistence problems with getting things done for sure.
*  I like patterns. I like visual patterns.
*  I like them because they're distracting.
*  And I suppose I think that there are forms of distraction that I would find unpleasant.
*  So there are definitely forms of distraction I find unpleasant, like if someone is talking
*  while I'm trying to work or something like that.
*  So maybe it's very it would be interesting to think about why some forms of distraction
*  feel pleasant and others feel unpleasant.
*  And I would I've never thought about this before, but I would sort of guess that there's a
*  feeling of volunteerism with the visual where I can look at it.
*  But it doesn't like force me to look at it, whereas a voice that is speaking, it's sort
*  of producing meaning in a way where I cannot detach from that.
*  I have to receive that meaning.
*  It's like a friend of mine once told me that she used to really enjoy the way the Coca
*  Cola signs look, the swirls.
*  And then she learned how to read and she couldn't see the pattern anymore because she was
*  receiving the meaning. Right.
*  And so there's this way in which a world of visual patterns is not a world that is
*  conveying meaning to me.
*  And that makes it feel unintrusive.
*  It allows me to think all the meaning thoughts I want without having them being imposed
*  by my space.
*  That's really interesting.
*  And I find that you do something else that I do and but that I don't know that many other
*  people do, which is always if I'm working, I'm listening to music and I'm listening
*  to one song on repeat.
*  And whatever I'm doing, I think I have to find I take a lot of time when I'm beginning
*  to write, finding the right song and then rejecting songs because they're not the right
*  mood and they're not the right vibe.
*  And this one's distracting me.
*  But when I find it, it's just like then it's just on repeat for six hours and then we're
*  done with the piece.
*  And I'm curious because you do this to one a little bit how you came to it, but to how
*  you choose the songs.
*  I'm much less systematic than you.
*  And I often choose the wrong song and just live with it.
*  And I actually almost sometimes I can enjoy the pain of the fact that it's the wrong
*  song that I'm listening to over and over again.
*  So there's a perversity to it.
*  But I think it also depends on what I'm writing.
*  Like if I'm writing about anger or like sadness, if I'm writing about emotions, I have
*  to feel the emotion that I'm writing about.
*  This is actually one of my biggest frustrations with academic writing on the emotions is
*  that so much of that writing is has as its content, the claim that there's a distinctively
*  emotional way of thinking where that thinking cannot be communicated except by way of the
*  emotion. But the piece is unemotional.
*  And it's like, well, do you believe it or not?
*  Right. So I feel like academic writing is not well suited to writing about the emotions.
*  Because you're not allowed to write emotionally.
*  But for me, in order to write emotionally, I have to feel to some extent the emotion.
*  So in that case, I don't know, like like if I'm writing about anger, like there was one
*  time I listened to the Nico K song, I'm a man over and over again.
*  That's like an angry song.
*  So or sadness, especially like if I'm writing about grief or loss or suffering, then I want
*  music that expresses that.
*  But often it will just be pretty random.
*  I like that. And I like the idea that you can you can get into the pain of the wrong
*  song. I'm going to try that for for a piece that has to be a little jarring sometimes.
*  I think it's a good place to end. So let me ask you what is always our final question with
*  one addendum, which is what are three books you would recommend to the audience that have
*  influenced you? And then what is one song used to feel either sadness or grief?
*  So a couple a month ago, two months ago, I read a biography for the first time.
*  I'd never read a biography.
*  For the first time.
*  Yes, first time.
*  Wow.
*  I thought I'd hate biographies because I associated them with history and I don't like
*  history. It doesn't make sense to me.
*  It's like a bunch of facts and I don't know how to fit them together.
*  And then there's a story being told about them.
*  But I'm always like, is this just one story that's chosen and could there be others?
*  And also, the story always began before it began.
*  And so I find history quite confusing.
*  So I sort of stayed away from biographies.
*  But then I was just reading a lot of Tolstoy and I'm like, let me try.
*  And I read a Tolstoy biography by Rosamund Bartlett and I loved it.
*  And I realized that biographies are not history.
*  They are like voyeurism.
*  It's like you get to peer inside someone's life and find out the things that they
*  would not have wanted to tell you.
*  So I'm going to recommend that.
*  And I actually thought maybe I'll never read another biography because it was so
*  perfect and maybe I'm just done.
*  But then I got sent a new biography about Fernando Pessoa, who's someone else I'm
*  into. And it's not out yet.
*  Who's Fernando Pessoa?
*  He is a Portuguese philosopher, poet, master of
*  personae. It's our early 20th century.
*  He wrote under heteronyms, not pseudonyms, heteronyms, because he saw them as
*  aspects of who he was.
*  And he had, I mean, 50 to 100 of them.
*  But there are three or four that became sort of prominent in his work.
*  He published almost nothing over his life.
*  He put all the stuff, papers in a trunk.
*  And his most famous book is called The Book of Disquiet.
*  I'll recommend that, too. It's wonderful.
*  It is a book about the restless mind.
*  Right. Like, what is it if you can just never fix on who you are or fix on how to
*  live your life? And at every moment, you're sort of shifting and thinking, what if I
*  saw this slightly differently?
*  He calls it my factless autobiography.
*  But anyway, I read this biography of Pessoa that was also wonderful.
*  It was like a thousand pages and I read it in a week.
*  I just couldn't stop reading it.
*  So I'll recommend that, too.
*  I started one last night. I started a biography of Augustine.
*  Do you know what it's called? The Fernanda Pessoa biography?
*  It's called Pessoa.
*  Pessoa.
*  Zenith is the author. It's coming out in July.
*  And last night, I started a biography of Augustine by Peter Brown.
*  That's just like a super famous biography that everyone's like, if you like biographies,
*  you should read this one because it's great.
*  And it's good. I've read maybe 50 pages.
*  But I sort of think, like, I sort of feel like now, well, you pick any person who was
*  passionate and driven and weird, you know, like Clarice LaSpector or W.B.
*  Du Bois or Simone Vey or someone like that, their biography is going to be great.
*  Right. And like the thing about biography is that you get to see how the sincerity
*  of someone's passion as it drives them to develop over the course of their life.
*  And I really didn't get that before I read one.
*  So I recommend the genre.
*  I love that.
*  There's a sad songs.
*  There's so many of them.
*  For some reason, the one that's jumping into my head is a song called Real Death by Mount Eerie.
*  That does sound sad.
*  It's by who you said?
*  I think it's Mount Eerie, I think is the name.
*  It's about the death of someone is makes a song about the death of his wife.
*  And his wife has just died.
*  And he's like, this is not art.
*  Like, this is real life.
*  And I'm actually really sad.
*  And it's somehow like the first line is death is real.
*  That is not like for making art about.
*  And it's this sort of very sincere attempt to almost transcend the act of turning
*  something into art and presenting it to you directly, like telling you like the backpack
*  that his wife ordered for their child whose school days she knew she would never see,
*  you know, arriving in the mail and like giving you these details.
*  But it's almost spoken that when I can't actually like listen to a lot, like if I'm
*  writing, it's sort of almost too sad.
*  But anyway, that's that's what jumped into my head.
*  That's an amazing recommendation.
*  Agnes Callard, it's been such a pleasure.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you. It's really fun.
*  That is a show.
*  Thank you all for listening.
*  If you enjoyed it, please rate it in your favorite podcast app or send it to a friend.
*  You know, I sometimes at the end of these two recommendations of my own on something
*  related to our conversation.
*  So we talked there about how Agnes and I both will put on individual songs over and over
*  and over again while we're working.
*  And I thought I'd list a few that I've been listening to recently.
*  So this one's an album, actually not a song, but Spencer Brown's Stream of Consciousness,
*  which is lush electronica, really, really good for work, but actually pretty sonically
*  interesting, really well crafted.
*  I really enjoyed that.
*  I've listened to it a lot recently.
*  Actually, a Roger Karma recommendation to me.
*  I was kind of gutted that MF Doom died.
*  I'm a big MF Doom fan from back in the day, and so I've been listening to a lot of him.
*  But if you don't know where to start, Doomsday is just one of my favorite songs full stop.
*  And it's been on in the background for me, actually in the foreground for me a lot lately.
*  And then finally, I just ran into this song, not really great for working, but just
*  beautiful vocals.
*  Someone else by Bishop Briggs featuring Jacob Banks.
*  I mean, you can turn that one on loud and you will really feel something.
*  The Astroclant Show is a production of New York Times Opinion.

*  music by Isaac Jones, and mixing by Jeff Geld.
