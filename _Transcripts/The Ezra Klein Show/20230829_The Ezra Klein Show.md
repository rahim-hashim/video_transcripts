# It’s Time to Talk About ‘Pandemic Revisionism’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdDHTrBUofw)
*  From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Hey it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave, but this week taking a turn, the mic is David Wallacewells.
*  He is a Times Opinion writer.
*  He's the author of The Uninhabitable Earth, Life After Warming.
*  And I just think that over the past couple of years, not just his work on climate change
*  and biodiversity loss, but also his work particularly on COVID has been absolutely fantastic.
*  So I asked him to come on and do a couple shows around these themes.
*  I hope you enjoy.
*  Last summer, the U.S. reached an important pandemic milestone.
*  According to multiple measures, the number of Americans dying today looks pretty close
*  to what it looked like just before the pandemic hit.
*  As my colleague David Leonhard noted in July, you can make a pretty good case that this
*  data shows the pandemic is finally, mercifully, over.
*  But over the last several months, I've started to worry that even as we put COVID-19 somewhat
*  in the rear view mirror, we're still not seeing the experience of the pandemic very
*  clearly in hindsight.
*  Officially, more than a million Americans have died of COVID.
*  But somehow that unbelievable fact isn't really the center of our story about the last three
*  years.
*  We're not properly mourning or grieving a million deaths.
*  Instead, we're arguing about school closures and mask mandates and the wisdom of the enormous
*  economic stimulus.
*  It doesn't feel like we've all just lived through a world historical trauma.
*  It feels like we're putting the pandemic to the same trivial, often partisan purposes
*  we put everything else.
*  In the spring, as congressional hearings led by Republicans on the early days of the pandemic
*  got underway, the epidemiologist Caitlin Gettilena wrote an essay on what she called this revisionist
*  phase of the pandemic.
*  I think that idea, revisionist history, offers perhaps the clearest description of the country's
*  strange relationships with the pandemic right now.
*  And so as the country moves on from the COVID emergency, I wanted to invite her on the show
*  to talk about that revisionism in all its forms.
*  As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at
*  Ezra Klein show at ny times.com.
*  Caitlin Gettilena, welcome to the podcast.
*  Yeah, thanks for having me.
*  So I wanted to start by asking, how do you think we ended up here?
*  More than 1.1 million officially dead and seeming to argue less about how we could have
*  saved more of those lives than about things like whether the FDA rushed to approve booster
*  shots for the young?
*  How did that happen?
*  I don't know if we had a lot of time to really process what happened the past three and a
*  half years.
*  As an epidemiologist, we've just been going 2000 miles per hour just trying not to crash
*  into a guardrail.
*  And I think we're finally at that stage where we can look back and process and reflect and
*  define what those lessons were learned and how we can do better and be smarter in the
*  future.
*  Back in March, I claimed that we are entering this new phase of the pandemic called
*  revisionism.
*  And I think there's an attempt to revise 2020 really under the comfort of 2023 vaccines
*  and treatment and immunity.
*  And I think there's a couple of reasons for that.
*  One, there's bad actors.
*  There's also really a lack of nuanced discussion around tradeoffs today.
*  But also it's just a normal human response.
*  You brought up the 1918 flu pandemic.
*  But how we remember and make decisions is largely driven by our experiences.
*  And it makes it easier to remember certain things while forgetting others.
*  And there's many biases contributing to this.
*  So I think we're in a really tough spot.
*  The past three and a half years were really tough for the United States, particularly
*  because we thought we were prepared and we were not.
*  And it really tested our morals, our values, our psychology, and our culture in the States
*  as well.
*  You wrote recently that humans don't like being reminded of their vulnerabilities.
*  It brings out a lot of hate and anger.
*  I've had a similar intuition for a while that we've argued about our response to the pandemic
*  sort of pointing our fingers at one another in part as a way of telling ourselves that
*  it didn't have to be so hard or so brutal or full of quite so much death.
*  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the way that we've been sort of projecting
*  our frustrations or despair onto one another, the way that we are engaging in revisionism
*  rather than reflection at the moment, and how that's messing up our picture of what
*  we actually live through.
*  Yeah, I think the natural human response is that we've all been through hell the past
*  three and a half years and what that looked like was very different for different groups
*  of people.
*  And we all want someone to blame, honestly.
*  And it's hard to blame a microscopic virus, right?
*  It's easier to blame other humans for mistakes or things that we didn't agree with.
*  And I have been particularly reflecting in this space of just how much hate I've received
*  the past three and a half years by being on the forefront and public facing of this pandemic,
*  death threats, microaggressions, doxing, pretty terrible things.
*  And the one thing I can reconcile with is that, one, people don't like being afraid.
*  People don't like not having answers.
*  And once we get through and we say, that was over, we survived, that sucked, but now things
*  are good, we're wanting to resolve that inconsistency.
*  And many people discount how bad things were then instead of focusing how good they are now.
*  Tell me how you see that point in particular.
*  How bad were things in 2020?
*  It was bad.
*  Early in 2020, it was horrible because, I mean, I just remember seeing body bags and
*  refrigerated trucks.
*  I distinctly remember that Red Cross ship passing by the Statue of Liberty.
*  I think that was in March of 2020.
*  And those were all very scary things.
*  I think the other really scary thing as scientists that we're trying to determine policies and
*  walk 330 million people through this experience was how little we knew as well.
*  It's easy to forget how many questions we had in the beginning.
*  And as we got questions answered as time went on, it was even more challenging to bring
*  the public along for the scientific discovery ride.
*  I think early Fauci said 70,000 Americans.
*  If anyone said in March of 2020, 1.2 million Americans, you would have been laughed at.
*  You know, I work for the New York Times.
*  We sort of famously put a banner headline across the front page when 100,000 Americans
*  died and listed them.
*  And that was an effort at some kind of public grieving, public mourning, but we basically
*  never indulged that impulse again.
*  We're at 11 times as many deaths and most of those milestones, 200,000, 300,000, 800,000,
*  even a million, most of those passed with much less fanfare, even though the death totals
*  are much larger.
*  When I hear you talking about the sort of grim memories of 2020 in particular, you know,
*  the Red Cross boat, the body bags, I also think about the temporary morgues that were
*  set up outside of hospitals.
*  I also remember a time of great panic and tangled up in that panic was already, even
*  from the start, a lot of partisanship and polarization.
*  And one of the things I heard from quite a lot of people on the left was if we had had
*  someone else in charge, we would not be dealing with this, that something like a zero COVID
*  outcome would have been possible with a different president.
*  But when I look at the comparison set across our peer countries, the US did do worse than
*  most of the countries it thinks of as its peers, both in the first year of the pandemic
*  and overall.
*  But especially in that first year, the gap between how poorly we did and how poorly everyone
*  else did seems relatively small, all things considered.
*  And I want to talk about the partisan dynamics and dimensions to that in a bit.
*  But I wanted to ask you first, just given how almost uniform the brutality of the disease
*  ended up being across the rich countries of the world, where you have, say, Europe as
*  a whole, I think on a per capita basis, they had about 80 or 85 percent as much death as
*  the US did.
*  How much of what we lived through, how much of that 1.1 million deaths, how much of that
*  pandemic brutality overall was avoidable in your view?
*  And how much of it was, in a way that we may be quite uncomfortable acknowledging, the
*  inevitable result of just this disease infecting and growing through this population on this
*  planet in this year, at this time with our politics?
*  Yeah, so you're right.
*  The United States is one of the leaders in excess deaths during this pandemic, and it's
*  only natural to compare to other countries and even comparing across states.
*  I think politics had a lot to do with it, but there is also really decisive politics
*  in other countries and they didn't do as bad.
*  And so I actually think one of the main reasons was because of our underfunded, fragmented
*  public health system in the United States, that this COVID-19 was just a different beast
*  and coordination across all local and states was close to impossible.
*  Talking about data infrastructure is one of them.
*  Another one is communication.
*  We, I still think we're doing a terrible job in communicating to the public on a national
*  and even sometimes local level on what's going on, bringing them again along for the
*  scientific discovery ride.
*  So there's that public health system that's underfunded that a lot of countries actually
*  fixed from past epidemics.
*  For example, I always look at Vietnam.
*  They didn't do a great job with SARS in 2003, but after that, they created a new public
*  health system from the lessons they learned, and that really paid off for them.
*  The other thing that we can't ignore in the United States is that we just didn't have
*  a lot of wiggle room to mess up.
*  We hit hospital capacity in a bad flu year, not even given a pandemic.
*  We also have very little safety nets for populations like health insurance, sick paid
*  leave, which a lot of other countries do have, like the UK or Sweden or Denmark.
*  And so, yes, I think politics fueled a lot of decisiveness, but I also think much deeper
*  underlying factors also played a very big part.
*  And in thinking about those challenges and those deeper underlying factors, in theory,
*  we could be responding and walking out of this pandemic and committing ourselves to
*  a real rededicated effort to build out our public health authority, build out our public
*  health infrastructure.
*  But as you noted earlier, when you mentioned that phrase, pandemic revisionism, we're doing
*  a little bit of that. We're trying to take measures now that might help us in future
*  pandemics, but at a sort of a cultural level, at a level of discourse and political debate,
*  we seem to be doing almost as much forgetting as we are returning and reforming.
*  And I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about what in particular you meant
*  when talking about pandemic revisionism.
*  What did you have in mind when you wrote that piece?
*  I think the bottom line is that revisionism is something that us humans are designed
*  to do, that we again, remember and make decisions largely based and driven on our
*  experiences. And part of that is psychological resilience.
*  And some of that is biological, right?
*  To wade through all of the information and all of the experiences we went through the past
*  three and a half years, we have to use shortcuts.
*  And our human brain isn't like a computer.
*  It's not just like data in or data out.
*  The way we think about things is not purely logical.
*  Biases have a large effect on memories.
*  So it is part of this cognitive dissonance that early 2020 was horrible, but things are
*  much better now. And we can reconsider this big past event and it can feel off putting
*  or inconsistent, but we want to resolve that inconsistency.
*  So many people discount how bad things were.
*  And one thing that I can, I think, really help with revisionism is having a serious
*  conversation about the COVID-19 pandemic and how to prepare for the future.
*  Like you said, we seem to be entering the cycle of panic and neglect.
*  And this cycle is not new for public health.
*  We go through this cycle of panic and neglect every single emergency in the United States.
*  And it is quite exhausting.
*  And we need to figure out a way to get out of that revolving door.
*  So we are better prepared for the future.
*  It seems to me that there's a sort of a growing consensus everywhere you look, not just on
*  the right, that as a whole, we went a little too far.
*  And I'm curious how you tell that story.
*  But the data points that spring to my mind are something like three dozen states have
*  passed laws restricting the future use of public health authority.
*  Polls show declining faith in public health and in vaccines.
*  Many Americans feel quite sure that schools stayed closed too long.
*  And if they ever should have closed in the first place, we can talk about schools in a
*  little bit more detail later. But when the Times conducted a survey of epidemiologists
*  and public health figures a few months ago about how we might respond to a future pandemic,
*  the prompt they gave was that they were facing a novel disease that was more infectious,
*  more deadly and didn't have the same age skew as Covid, which means that young people
*  were just as likely to die from this imagined new disease as the old one.
*  And yet almost every expert weighing in on every policy question put to them advised
*  that in response to that new disease, we should do a little bit less and respond with a
*  lighter touch than we had with Covid.
*  How do you think about this national move?
*  It's not all the way to let it rip.
*  But if we were living in a way that was animated by a lot of fear in 2020, it seems to me
*  like we're living now or thinking about Covid now in ways that have much more to do
*  with some mix of excess confidence or fatalism.
*  Though those sound contradictory at a policy level, they kind of end up in the same
*  place. How do you think about why we're there and where that's pulling us now?
*  I think there's several reasons.
*  The one big lesson that I learned that we were never taught in in school, for example,
*  was that policy isn't just determined by epidemiology or science.
*  It's dependent on psychology, culture, resources, competing demands,
*  morals. I was an epidemiologist helping lead the response in Texas.
*  And I will forever be grateful for that, because the one thing it taught me was to
*  listen, like really listen, not just hear, but listen to the competing demands, the
*  risks and the benefits, putting the public back in public health.
*  So what would that look like?
*  I mean, I recently went back and looked at the pandemic policies, particularly in the
*  pre-vaccine period, so basically across 2020.
*  And I was really surprised to see how much at the state level, at least, how much
*  unanimity there was in terms of what are often called lockdowns, school closures,
*  business restrictions, social gathering restrictions.
*  There was a lot of difference at the level of rhetoric from leaders.
*  But when it came to like the actual measures that were put into place for most of that
*  spring and summer, and even by some measures into the fall, we were moving somewhat in
*  unison. Did you feel at the time in Texas that there was a real groundswell of
*  opposition and they were, you know, resistance was growing and could be alleviated if
*  concerns were listened to?
*  And how could we do better in listening to the people who might have felt boxed out of
*  those conversations?
*  I absolutely saw what you're saying.
*  The spring summer of 2020, I felt like everyone was on the same page, whether it was
*  Republican state or Democrat state or rural or urban.
*  And then the school debate started in late summer of 2020.
*  And I think that this is where we started seeing a difference in values and a
*  difference in priorities, depending on where you stood and where you were.
*  And so I think that really started fueling this.
*  Of course, you then also had the never maskers becoming more and more loud in fall
*  of 2020. And then once vaccines hit, you have disinformation sowing a lot of doubt.
*  But also people were starting to get protected.
*  And what that meant, the risk calculus started changing over time.
*  And I think because of that, on an individual level, values became louder and
*  louder. And how do we do that better in the future?
*  Other than truly having an ear to the ground and communicating and framing things
*  that it's not us against each other, it's us against a virus, it's not the economy
*  against public health, it's them together is a billion dollar question.
*  And I am not convinced that we will do better next time with this, because again,
*  we just haven't had a really serious conversation about the risks and benefits.
*  Yeah, I mean, this whole subject raises to me what's a kind of huge looming
*  question, which is how well did our mitigation measures actually work?
*  How do we know how well we did in the pre-vaccine phase?
*  What do we know about what impact things like school closures and masking and social
*  distancing had on the spread of the disease?
*  There was a big paper that came out a couple weeks ago, I think, showing that overall,
*  in the aftermath of vaccinations, Republican voters were 43 percent more likely to die,
*  I think, than Democratic voters, which is a mind boggling effect.
*  But almost as striking to me was that in the phase before vaccination, there was no
*  difference at all. And that matches some other studies that have been done.
*  And I wonder, you know, thinking both in a state by state comparison way, a community
*  to community comparison way, thinking about the international level, how do you think
*  about this whole suite of things we did in 2020 to stop the spread of the virus?
*  And how should we think about to what degree we might want to think about implementing
*  them or revising our policies?
*  Should we be faced with a similar set of dilemmas or decisions sometime against soon?
*  I think this is why I'm having a challenging time answering your previous question is
*  because we do not know how mitigation measures compared to vaccinations, for example,
*  in terms of mortality.
*  So we know vaccination saved more than three million people in the United States.
*  That's a pretty easy analysis that the Commonwealth Fund just put out a few months ago.
*  But beyond that, we still do not know what works best to slow the spread of COVID-19
*  in terms of non-pharmaceutical interventions, for example, test and trace or isolation or
*  quarantine or indoor mask mandates or closing venues.
*  And this is very surprising to me because that means we still can't answer important
*  questions like you're asking, like their effectiveness or even more importantly, the
*  tradeoffs.
*  We can see in the scientific literature that prolonged shelter in places are linked to,
*  for example, harmful alcohol use.
*  But how does that compare to uncontrolled viral transmission?
*  We don't know.
*  And these analyses are incredibly complicated to do accurately.
*  But I think they're equally important because we need these answers to be armed with better
*  knowledge to do better next time.
*  And unfortunately, these difficult questions don't win a lot of political points.
*  And I think one of the reasons why we're not finding answers right now.
*  Can I ask you just in particular, like what you think about, for instance, the effect
*  of school closures on spread or the effect of masking on spread?
*  I mean, do you think that we can talk about that in meaningful detail?
*  Or do you think it's still a kind of a black box that simply requires more study and more
*  scrutiny?
*  Well, we can tackle masking first.
*  Everyone wants a one word answer to this question is do masks work?
*  But there's a whole lot more nuance.
*  These three words strung together beg several loaded questions.
*  What does work mean?
*  And what kind of mass during what period of transmission?
*  What disease?
*  What social context?
*  So it's a really complicated question.
*  So when I think about mass, I really divide it into three buckets.
*  One is can mass physically stop droplets and aerosols coming in or out?
*  This is a physics question.
*  And the answer is yes.
*  We've seen many lab studies with SARS-CoV-2 that show that the number of particles inhaled
*  by someone is stopped by mass and the number of particles emitted by a person in a lab
*  is stopped by mass.
*  The better the mask, for example, filter and fit, the better the stop of transmission.
*  So we have that physics lab.
*  That's obvious.
*  The second question is do mass work on an individual level?
*  Right.
*  So if mass work in the lab, they must prevent infections among individuals in the real world.
*  But that's not necessarily correct because tightly controlled environments are very
*  different than the real world.
*  And we've seen that some people don't wear them correctly.
*  They wear them at different frequencies.
*  And then the third bucket is, and I think this is where you're getting at,
*  with the huge policy question is if mass work in a lab and sometimes on individuals,
*  then if hundreds and thousands of people wear them perfectly and imperfectly at one time,
*  do they reduce transmission during a pandemic?
*  And this is a question we do not have a good answer to.
*  Theoretically, mass will reduce the risk of transmission if they do so on an individual
*  level because when a community masks, those small effects compound exponentially across
*  the population, which would make a dent in cases.
*  But how much mass reduced transmission in a population is not an answer we have.
*  There's been very few studies that have looked at this.
*  And among the few studies, there's a huge range, around 9% to 45% reduction in transmission
*  with community masking.
*  And this range means that these studies were done in different settings and different cultures.
*  So many unanswered questions remain.
*  So if you say do mass work, I guess my answer would be yes.
*  But how much they work during a pandemic is, and what that again, that trade off is with
*  social, moral, cultural factors during an emergency is something we need to understand
*  a whole lot more.
*  Well, I was struck over the past couple of years by just how much backlash it also produced.
*  I mean, my view throughout was that even if masks only reduced disease transmission by
*  10%, which is an effect that's meaningful, but on the margin, I still think what's the
*  cost to me of putting on a mask when I go into grocery store?
*  What's the cost to me of putting on a mask when I get on the subway?
*  It just doesn't feel like such a large imposition, even over a pretty extended period of time,
*  even if it has some amount of real benefit to the broader population.
*  And it just feels like that was not the way that many Americans thought about masks.
*  In fact, I often hear people talking about the experience of the pandemic.
*  Like they describe any period of time in which they were even encouraged to wear a mask as
*  though it was like the equivalent of lockdown.
*  And I view it as much more a tool to allow us to continue to operate somewhat normally
*  with a few additional protections to protect the people around us.
*  But the backlash just seems to me at least huge compared to the imposition.
*  But maybe more importantly, we just don't have a very good idea of how to balance that
*  risk of backlash against the ultimate benefit.
*  And maybe you could say the backlash was worth it if it reduced cases by 50%.
*  But if you're just a 10% and you're introducing a policy or policy guidance that ends up eroding
*  trust in public health authorities and ultimately maybe diminishing vaccine uptake down the road,
*  it seems like a trickier question to answer in a definitive way.
*  Oh, it's a super tricky question.
*  I think what it comes down to is that masks were used as a symbol of tribalism.
*  And so masks were politicized.
*  So whether you wore a mask or you did not wear a mask showed exactly what tribe you're in.
*  And that was a very dangerous thing to play with.
*  Making public health measures, our tools, which we have very little of at a population level,
*  a symbol of bipartisanship was dangerous.
*  And I think it's going to hurt us during the next pandemic and even during our respiratory
*  flu seasons as well, because it does help on an individual level.
*  And I wish it wasn't made into that symbol.
*  Well, another thing that was polarized almost from the start, but certainly in the more
*  recent years was the kind of counter example of Sweden.
*  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you saw that country's approach,
*  maybe how you understood it at the outset and how, if your thinking has evolved about
*  what they achieved and didn't achieve, how it has evolved over time.
*  It's really challenging to compare across states, let alone countries,
*  because what works in one country doesn't work in another and vice versa.
*  And I think we can learn lessons from each other and we should,
*  but they also must be adapted in our context.
*  Like I said earlier, just letting a virus run rampant like Sweden did in the beginning
*  in an immune naive population was just not an option us Americans had.
*  I will also say that Sweden didn't also have a perfect response compared to the United States.
*  They had less excess deaths, but compared to their neighbors like Denmark,
*  they did a much more terrible job if we judge their job on excess deaths.
*  And even if they didn't have policies, there was still individual level behavior changes
*  because people just wanted to protect themselves as well in Sweden.
*  So I will say it's very difficult to compare against Sweden for reasons I said earlier,
*  just because we have also different safety nets.
*  We don't have health insurance and paid sick leave and good hospital capacity like other countries do.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think some measures of excess mortality had 10 times as many Swedes dying
*  in the first year of the pandemic as Norwegians.
*  So there are complications all around.
*  I didn't mean to suggest that Sweden was a model of an ideal approach.
*  When I've written about them recently, I've said what's striking is
*  how average their pandemic outcomes were ultimately.
*  But also in terms of what they actually did at the time,
*  we talk about them as an example of everybody go their own way,
*  kind of almost let it rip approach to the disease.
*  But there was a lot of guidance offered.
*  A lot of schools did in fact close for a period of time.
*  A lot of people did shelter in place for a period of time.
*  It was just built in a somewhat less heavy-handed way.
*  Although, as I said earlier, I think we also to some degree overstate
*  how heavy-handed the American policy response was.
*  These lockdowns, what we call lockdowns, lasted five weeks in the average Republican state,
*  seven weeks in the average Democratic state.
*  This is in a pandemic that lasted three years.
*  But we have this memory of this unbelievably extended, ongoing, and brutal lockdown,
*  which wasn't really the way most Americans navigated the pandemic.
*  And then we compare it and contrast it with countries like Sweden
*  that we say had a much more hands-off approach.
*  But in fact, at a practical level, people were behaving
*  in the way that they were going to behave, responding to the threats of the pandemic
*  in the way that they were going to respond to them.
*  And the differences between the countries was not nearly as great
*  as a lot of the political rhetoric tends to suggest.
*  I completely agree with you.
*  And I would consider the United States middle of the road too.
*  I mean, you look at the other end of New Zealand and Australia,
*  or even China with their very, very long policies.
*  The landscape in which these unfold is really important.
*  And like you said, we have to be very careful with revisionism
*  and what happened and what we feel like happened.
*  I will also say that Sweden didn't also have a perfect response.
*  Compared to the United States, they had less excess deaths.
*  But compared to their neighbors like Denmark,
*  they did a much more terrible job if we judge their job on excess deaths.
*  And even if they didn't have policies, there was still individual-level behavior changes
*  because people just wanted to protect themselves as well in Sweden.
*  So I will say it's very difficult to compare against Sweden for reasons I said earlier,
*  just because we have different safety nets.
*  We don't have health insurance and paid sick leave and good hospital capacity like other countries do.
*  So let's talk about in some more focus the partisan dynamics that we've been touching on throughout.
*  But just to take them slightly more front and center.
*  Donald Trump was, for a lot of liberal Americans at least,
*  the kind of gravitational center of COVID policy in 2020.
*  And we almost wanted to believe that he was singularly responsible for the pandemic as a whole.
*  And at the time, my thoughts sort of ran along those lines as well.
*  I was frustrated over and over again, disappointed in his sort of indifference.
*  But when I look at the pandemic overall, I see the US performing,
*  as I said earlier, a bit less well than its peers in 2020,
*  and then a lot less well than its peers in 2021.
*  And that second story has a lot more to do with vaccination and vaccination uptake
*  than it does with, presumably, with non-pharmaceutical interventions.
*  But of course, Donald Trump plays an interesting and complicated role on vaccination too,
*  since he's both one of the authors of the Operation Warp Speed,
*  in some ways responsible for the rapid development and rollout of those vaccines,
*  and also as someone who is a kind of inveterate down player of the risks of the pandemic,
*  presumably someone who also dampened enthusiasm, at least among his supporters,
*  for vaccination uptake when the vaccines eventually became available, mostly under Joe Biden.
*  So how do you think about Donald Trump in thinking about the sort of longer story of the pandemic?
*  So Operation Warp Speed was a huge success. There is no question about that.
*  And I was really happy about how that played out. So I want to say that positive.
*  I think, though, one thing I was incredibly frustrated with, particularly in the beginning
*  of setting the stage of what SARS-CoV-2 is, introducing this threat to Americans,
*  was just the lack of communication. And when I have started digging into why this was the case,
*  why were we so reactive rather than proactive in framing this issue and warning Americans,
*  and again, framing it as us against the virus instead of us against each other.
*  A lot of other countries did that. I keep seeing how it comes down to putting a muzzle on the CDC,
*  political interference with public health officials. And so that lack of communication
*  went for months and months. For example, COVID-19 data. We didn't even have data coming out of the
*  CDC. John Hopkins had to step up, and volunteer efforts had to step up to actually understand
*  what was going on. And putting a muzzle on public health officials and the experts in this context
*  did irreparable damage and a reason, I think, that a lot of trust was lost.
*  And you see opening up in really with the vaccine rollout, these huge partisan divides,
*  which again, were not so present in much of the policy response before then. But I think there's
*  also a way of looking at that vaccine rollout as a kind of a success story. And there's a dark side
*  too. There's a downside. There's a way in which we failed. But early on in the vaccine rollout,
*  there was a lot of talk about the polio vaccine and how much outreach was and energy was put
*  behind getting that into kids' arms in the 50s. But I went back and looked recently and
*  the Jonas Salk polio vaccine was introduced in 1955 and targeted toward the young. And by 1961,
*  so five or six years later, it had only reached about half of Americans under the age of 60.
*  And with these vaccines, within two years, we got to 80% of adults and 95 or even 99% of vulnerable
*  seniors. So, you know, of course, the context is different. The pandemic in this case was raging
*  in a much more profound way than polio had been 70 years ago. But I also think it's striking that
*  we got such a large percentage of the country to take vaccines against a disease they hadn't heard
*  of a year or two before. The shots themselves had been developed over the course of just a few
*  months. And you know, it wasn't perfect. We did less well than most of our peers in Europe. And
*  we suffered a lot in 2021 as a result. But just as a kind of a baseline, where are we in public
*  health history, kind of a data point, it feels to me that not only do we sometimes underappreciate
*  or under-celebrate Operation Warp Speed, but we also don't quite appreciate how significant it is
*  that we got four out of five adults to take a vaccine. We got 19 out of 20 or more seniors to
*  take a vaccine. Does that match how you see the rollout? Or should I be taking a more sort of
*  darker view of how much worse we did than our peers? No, I keep going back to those stats too,
*  that 91% of Americans over 12 years old has one dose in their arm. That is incredible feat. And
*  that took a ton of on the ground work, engaging with stakeholders, answering questions. I think
*  we could have done it quicker. And I think we could have gotten the full vaccine series to a
*  whole lot more people. But I do think that is a huge success that is underplayed. And I wish that
*  we would look at the successes as much as our failures. Even with that rollout, we have this
*  remarkable phenomenon in the US, which tells the story of the gap between our vaccination coverage
*  and the coverage in other countries where we had this significant uptake, the overwhelming majority
*  of the most vulnerable people getting shots pretty quickly. And yet, because it happened at a time
*  when we were seeing these new variants that also spread more rapidly, the ultimate impact on our
*  national death tolls was not all that significant. 2021 was a deadlier year than 2020 was. And I
*  wonder if we made some mistakes there in communication, if we were so focused on talking
*  about the risk to individuals given an infection and not enough about the risk of infection and
*  the way that those two things combined that we sometimes gave, especially people who are
*  vaccinated a little bit too much of a sense of their own invulnerability, because at the national
*  level, we got everybody vaccinated, individuals were protected quite significantly, but not all
*  the way to 100%. When you have the disease spreading five times as fast in a population
*  that has one fifth the mortality risk that they had before, the net effect is kind of equal.
*  Do you think that we could have done a better job of continuing to advise, especially the vulnerable
*  elderly, the vulnerable vaccinated elderly in the aftermath of mass vaccination?
*  Absolutely. Again, one of the biggest lessons I learned was how important scientific communication
*  is. And that includes discussion of uncertainty and a discussion of how our knowledge evolves.
*  One key example that I just can't get out of my head is telling people that once they're vaccinated,
*  they could take off their masks. And that was such a big mistake because we didn't also communicate
*  what we didn't know, which was we didn't know how this virus was going to continue to mutate. We
*  didn't know how well our vaccines would keep up. So just getting that one dose is just not enough.
*  Just not wearing a mask or not thinking about ventilation or not testing, just having a vaccine
*  strategy is going to let the virus leak through for a certain amount of population. And when
*  you're talking about 330 million Americans, that's going to be a big chunk. And so yeah,
*  I think that our proactive scientific communication around this was a big mistake.
*  And we also can't discount that that was also happening at a time where with a very different
*  information ecosystem, with a disinformation and anti-science rhetoric really getting pushed out at
*  the same time, sowing doubt. And we didn't recognize that a top-down approach is no longer
*  adaptable to today's times, that information is no longer dictated by authorities when it's
*  networked by peers. And we need to adapt to that sort of system in public health.
*  Yeah, I mean, on the communication point, I guess, given what we're saying earlier about masks,
*  it doesn't seem to me to be so foolish to say you might feel a bit more comfortable taking off your
*  mask once you've been vaccinated. The thing that's really striking to me is how little
*  communication around the age skew of these effects really was so that someone who was 80 didn't
*  understand what a different landscape they were facing than someone who was 60, than someone who
*  was 40. And we heard a lot about how the old were more vulnerable. But I think even the people for
*  whom that information was most relevant, which is to say the very elderly, weren't given enough
*  context for just how large that skew really was, or someone who's in their 80s might be a thousand
*  times more vulnerable to infection than someone who's, say, a teenager, and may even be a few
*  times more vulnerable than someone who's just five or 10 years younger. And that goes especially for
*  the post vaccination era in which someone who's 80 reduced their risk significantly, but was still
*  the equivalent of someone who is unvaccinated and say 60. And the guidance that we gave someone who
*  is unvaccinated and 60 before the vaccinations was not do whatever you want, go about your life as
*  though everything's normal. It was let's take a lot of precautions. Now someone who is 20 and vaccinated,
*  the logic looks a lot different. You could probably feel comfortable saying, okay, you know, mostly
*  this risk has been reduced quite close to zero, and you should think about your life in quite
*  different terms. You're completely right that communicating risk accurately and without bias is
*  absolutely crucial. And this is because contextualizing really small numbers and really
*  large numbers is close to impossible for human brains. And that lack of risk communication
*  is because it was multi-dimensional, very complicated to quantify and even more difficult
*  to communicate. And I think this is especially true with infectious diseases because risk changes
*  with time and varies across different people. And one thing we didn't do well in public health was
*  try and communicate this risk, particularly because this was a novel threat. A lot of humans,
*  even today, don't know where to place this in the repertoire of things trying to kill us. And so
*  getting better at data-driven guides of personal risk would be incredibly helpful moving forward.
*  You know, Joe Biden comes into office in January 2021. And since that point,
*  something like two thirds of all the COVID deaths that we've had in this country have taken place.
*  This is a period of time in which he also had the tool of vaccines that Donald Trump didn't have.
*  He campaigned for the presidency in part by saying someone who presided over 200,000 American deaths
*  should not continue to hold that office. And yet he's been in office for 700,000 American deaths.
*  The first year was presided over by a COVID minimizing president. The second and third
*  years, in theory, at least presided over by a president who purported to take the threat
*  seriously and wanted to get a handle on it and put science back in the White House. And yet we
*  ended up with this quite grim, ugly outcome of the last two years. In fact, the US experience of
*  those 2021 in particular was worse than its peers by a much larger margin than had been the case in
*  2020. And this is to me a kind of a sad, distressing and somewhat disorienting story about the pandemic,
*  which is to say we remember a lot of that initial panic. We're still fighting about it. We're still
*  arguing about it. We also remember it. And we've just done a much less job of sort of marking time
*  and marking the tragedy of the last two years, where we've kind of taken our eye off of the actual
*  toll of the disease and let it unfold in a much less center stage kind of way. And I wonder why
*  you think that happened or how you think about that phenomenon. I think it happened because of
*  four reasons. One is the pandemic fatigue. We just are sick of it and we start normalizing it.
*  Second, it shows also the failure of approaching an infectious disease in an individualistic way
*  that we essentially ignored in the United States, that infectious disease violates the assumption of
*  independence, that what your neighbor does around you in a bus or at work or at school directly
*  impacts you. And this is very different than, for example, diabetes or cancer, where if you get
*  diabetes, then the person next to you won't necessarily get diabetes. And this individual
*  level risk management perspective or framing that we went into in the United States in year two and
*  year three is against everything that public health is. That public health doesn't treat individuals,
*  we treat populations. And losing that narrative thread was a disservice to Americans.
*  I think also the third thing that really impacted our normalization of deaths was the
*  integration of politics into public health. I know a lot of people in public health were
*  quite excited when Biden took office because we thought it was going to be a very different type
*  of approach, but ended up being pretty darn similar to the administration before. And I think
*  that also hurt Americans as well. So I think it's complicated. I think it is incredibly tragic,
*  and it's hard to visualize 1.1 million Americans dead. Like you said, I saved that New York Times
*  front page article of 100,000, but how do you communicate 10 times that is very challenging
*  to do? And we need to do that in order to show the true toll. I would just add one point to the
*  political item on your list, which I think is really a good one. And that is in 2020, liberals,
*  because they were so outraged at Donald Trump's handling of the disease, were also therefore
*  kind of keeping a close score. They were pointing to the deaths and being outraged about it.
*  And while Republicans were minimizing or dismissing a lot of the impact, at least half the country was
*  still focused on this as a grim, horrifying tragedy and an outrage. And that meant that
*  the death totals just had a sort of a political and cultural currency. And when the control of
*  the White House switched over, it just seemed like a lot of the partisan imperatives were not aligned
*  for anyone to keep such a close track of the score. And as a result, we sort of looked past a lot of
*  what was going on and in fact, look past a lot of, for instance, that pretty soon the majority of
*  deaths were among the vaccinated and started modulating or calibrating our sense of the state
*  of play much more by the resuming normalcy of our own lives than by the mortality statistics,
*  however large they may be. I wanted to ask now just what you cited earlier as the sort of,
*  I don't know if you'd exactly want to call it like the original sin, but it's definitely like the
*  still the hottest, most argued over subject when it comes to pandemic response. And that's school
*  closures. Can you tell me what you thought about school policy say beginning in the spring of 2020
*  and to the extent that your thinking has changed over time, explain a little bit about how that
*  might've happened? Yeah, so many thoughts on this. To me, how we should think about the costs of
*  schools closures, there's really only tough and tougher policy decisions during an emergency.
*  I want to start with that. I do not envy decision makers in times of emergency because many decisions
*  are trust jumps, whether we like it or not. And I think schools is a great example. So in Texas,
*  we opened schools in fall of 2020 and I will say I was not happy about it at the time,
*  but I distinctly remember AAP's strong recommendation to get kids in schools because
*  the reason I was having a really hard time with this in early 2020 is because in policy, right,
*  we typically weigh benefits with risks. But what if we don't know the risks at the time, right?
*  It's hard to remember how little we knew back then. Are children truly less risk than adults?
*  Because this typically isn't how viruses work. Do we throw immune naive teachers into an environment
*  without vaccines? Are schools super spreaders for a community? What will be the impact on
*  multi-generational homes? Do masks work on a population level? And it also wasn't clear what
*  schools were actually doing if they were opening. And many school closures were in part harmful,
*  I would say, because low income children didn't have access to laptops or high speed internet,
*  which local and state and even federal governments could have addressed, but they really didn't.
*  So looking back, I am glad we opened schools in fall of 2020. I was not happy about it,
*  but I struggle because I don't know what the answer would be for next time, because the lessons
*  learned from COVID-19 may not apply in the future. Because again, like I said, this virus is really
*  odd. Typically, viruses impact children and older adults the most because of their immune system,
*  but that wasn't the case here. And in the future, it may be. And so this risk benefit ratio of
*  closing schools may change. And I think we really need to keep that in mind.
*  I guess my feeling was that it seemed perfectly reasonable in the spring, even as we knew a bit
*  about the age skew, it seemed perfectly reasonable that if we were going into a quite aggressive
*  COVID mitigation phase, a sort of a flatten the curve at all costs phase, it seemed perfectly
*  reasonable to me that schools would close. I did wish that we did more over the spring, the summer
*  to make more schools able to open in September than we're ultimately able to. And I found myself
*  frustrated over the course of that year, that many places in many parts of the country were having a
*  really hard time doing that, even as schools elsewhere in the world managed to open without,
*  it seems, really significant spillover effects on their populations. But I also thought that the
*  costs of our continued lockdown have been somewhat overstated. And I wondered what you thought about
*  the pandemic learning loss discussion, because to me, we've had setbacks, all the measures which
*  are imperfect measures, but all the measures so that students suffered as a result of being out
*  of school, although the correlations are not super clear at every level in general, I think we can
*  say that the country did worse during the pandemic years than in previous years. But they also, those
*  losses seem relatively small to me, given the scale of the rhetoric that we often hear that this is a
*  generational setback, and it may ultimately impose a larger cost on the country than the pandemic as
*  a whole did. We're talking about students performing on most of these national standardized tests,
*  about the level they did sometime around the year 2000. In some cases, they went back to their
*  performance levels in 1998, in some cases in 2003. And to my mind, if you've taken a poll of all the
*  country's parents in the spring of 2020 and said, we're going to be going through a really bumpy
*  road, there's going to be a lot of death in this country, there's going to be a lot of struggle to
*  limit disease spread, there's going to be a lot of political battle around all of those interventions,
*  it's going to be a quite messy, ugly time on almost any measure or metric that you use.
*  And as a result of all of that disruption, your child will have the school experience that he or
*  she might have had 20 years ago. I think that just about every parent would have been pretty happy
*  taking that deal. And now we're looking at that same data and saying, this is not just a horrible
*  loss. And it's not just a policy problem that we should be endeavoring to ameliorate. But it is,
*  in fact, somehow like the signal crime of the whole pandemic that we've put so much on the nation's
*  children and burdened them with so much in ways that were unnecessary and ultimately just dramatically
*  harmful. And I just have a hard time seeing it that way. I wonder what your thoughts are.
*  I have mixed feelings about this because I do see the harms. And as a mom,
*  you don't mess with my kids, right? I think the other challenge that's also unfolding
*  simultaneously with this is the correlation versus causation debate, particularly around
*  not just the testing scores that you mentioned, but also mental health among kids right now.
*  And I think a lot of people are linking lockdowns and no school to a rise in mental health without
*  a broader context that actually we have had a rise in mental health even before the pandemic.
*  A new study just came out that suicides did not increase during stay at home orders or schools
*  closed. And so- And in fact, there was an uptick when the schools reopened, right?
*  Yeah, and there's an uptick when the schools reopen. And so again, I think we're getting
*  really stuck into this debate of a false dichotomy that you are either pro-schools closing or
*  anti-schools closing. Well, in reality, I think we're more on a spectrum. And it hits very close
*  to home because these are our kids and we want them to be okay. I think kids are incredibly
*  resilient and they will be okay. They are just growing up in a very different time than we all
*  grew up. And to us, that is unfamiliar and scary. I don't want to undersell the disruption of school
*  closures and indeed the pandemic as a whole on children. I think it was in many ways devastating
*  for many kids and the educational setbacks are real, especially, you know, we had made a lot of
*  progress over the last 20 years. It just seems to me to be something that we might think we might
*  consider as part of the bundle of difficulty that we all struggled through over the last three years,
*  rather than something that should be set apart as an exceptional failure on the part of the country.
*  I agree with you. I think the lesson really learned though is what you mentioned was that
*  opening schools during our next pandemic, because we're going to have another pandemic,
*  should be a priority and opening them in a safe way with 21st century tools, not these 19th century
*  tools to fight a 21st century virus. And that is something I did not see happen, play out in Texas,
*  for example, where I was, that we needed to prioritize, yeah, opening schools, but opening
*  them safely so we get the benefits of not super spreader events, but also the benefits of the
*  safety and having food and all the benefits structured learning has. And I hope that that
*  can be at the forefront of our mind going forward, even before the debate about opening businesses and
*  venues and all of that, which if I remember correctly, which is all jumbled now,
*  took precedent over opening schools safely. I mean, I think what you're bringing us to is a
*  useful perspective on which to sort of close the conversation, which is that
*  on all of these particular subjects, what we're really talking about are trade-offs,
*  but we're talking about those trade-offs at a cultural level, at a political level,
*  in needlessly binary terms and not thinking smartly enough about exactly how to balance
*  the different sets of interests. And if someone feels like, for instance, schools were closed too
*  long, it seems like the default position they return to is that schools should never have closed
*  at all. And that just feels perhaps that ultimately in a different pandemic might be the right choice.
*  It just seems like a hard thing to judge leaders for in this pandemic as we were sprinting through
*  an incredibly panicked phase as a country. But I wanted to ask you about that bigger picture
*  perspective, which is just to say, if these are all trade-offs and if one of the things that we
*  should have learned over the course of this pandemic is how much each decision is a balancing act,
*  a political balancing act, a social balancing act to some degree, like an emotional balancing act,
*  are we in any better of a place in thinking through those trade-offs than we were
*  three years ago? Is it possible that we could respond to a next pandemic in a better way than
*  we did this one? We're in a worse position in some senses and a better position in others.
*  How we respond to the next pandemic or the next novel threat is up to us right now. Yes,
*  there's going to be a new threat. It's going to be probably very different than SARS-CoV-2 and how
*  it looks and how it spreads. But that doesn't mean all the lessons that we learned over the past
*  three and a half years are not applicable and that they won't help. I go back to other countries that
*  prepared after SARS and how well they did with SARS-CoV-2. We have very smart modelers out there.
*  We have very smart technology and I think we just have to get smarter at working with each other.
*  One of the ways I think we do that is we need a COVID-19 commission, just like we had with 9-11,
*  that really digs down into what we got right, but what we got wrong and more importantly why.
*  Having a very honest conversation about this to move forward and that's just something I haven't
*  seen done, which has been disappointing. It's almost hard for me to imagine how that would
*  play out in our current political environment. I mean, it just seems to me we're sort of doomed
*  to be living with an impoverished history here that we're so captive on almost all sides of the
*  spectrum from almost all perspectives. We're so captive to not just partisanship, but certain
*  kinds of wishful thinking and coping mechanisms that we're just not seeing what we went through
*  clearly enough to learn from it. Yes, but also just reckon with it and see clearly that we went
*  through a world historical trauma. We have suffered enormously, especially those who died
*  and those who are sick, but even those of us whose lives were just disrupted in more quotidian ways,
*  we're still quite discombobulated by that experience. It feels to me really quite strange
*  that we're sort of walking like zombies out of that experience into a future without actually
*  processing or seeing clearly what we went through. I guess I'd like to think that a COVID-19
*  commission could give us the basis of a real factual history, but I don't know. It seems so
*  hard to imagine it unfolding, at least in the context of Congress in this country. Probably
*  for me, it would have to come from somewhere else or some other civil society organization.
*  I think you're exactly right. Because it was so politically charged the past three and a half
*  years that I don't know if it belongs in Congress. It may belong at a middle of the road foundation.
*  I think I have less doom and gloom than you have. It takes time to process trauma.
*  And at least us in the public health world, and I'm sure also with reporters, we just haven't had
*  that time to self-reflect and to process. I haven't. And it's going to take time to heal
*  and to understand and to try to hear the other side and try to hear what we got wrong and how
*  we can do better in the future. Well, we always end the show with book recommendations. So,
*  Caitlin, what are three books that you'd recommend on COVID or about anything else?
*  Yeah, I'll give one COVID, but I'm like sick of reading about COVID. So this summer I've started
*  You're part of the problem, Caitlin. I am. But I've started digging into more fun books. But
*  the one COVID one, if I were to recommend it to anyone, is called Lessons from the COVID War,
*  an investigative report. I thought this book was absolutely spot on on the lessons we learned
*  throughout the pandemic. It was written by the 9-11 Commission director, and it has a lot of
*  input from a lot of scientists around the United States. And I really enjoyed that book.
*  The other books I'm reading right now beyond COVID is Open by Andre Agassi. It's about a tennis
*  player, and I never really cared about tennis before, but he is such a good storyteller.
*  I've just been hooked this summer reading his story. So highly recommend that autobiography.
*  And the other one that I just started is Lessons in Chemistry, which is pretty hilarious and light.
*  And so I've appreciated just being able to escape in those two worlds.
*  Caitlin Joglina, thanks so much for coming on the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
