Video Description: If Joe Biden steps aside for the Democratic presidential nomination — still a very big if — the favorite to replace him is Vice President Kamala Harris. In recently leaked post-debate polling from Open Labs (https://puck.news/biden-plunges-in-swing-states-in-leaked-post-debate-poll/) , Harris polled better than Biden in matchups against Trump.


In 2019, Dana Goodyear wrote in The New Yorker (https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/22/kamala-harris-makes-her-case) , “As a Black, female law-and-order Democrat, Harris creates a kind of cognitive dissonance.” The profile Harris inhabited then would be welcome in an election year where disorder is on voters’ minds and the Republicans are nominating a convicted felon. But Harris hasn’t inhabited that political profile for years. And since becoming Biden’s vice president the conventional wisdom on her has shifted: She’s gone from rising star — many thought her “the next Obama” — to political underachiever.


So I’ve had a few questions about Harris. What accounted for the fast fall from grace after she took the vice presidency? What happened to the smart-on-crime prosecutor we once saw? What has the White House done — or not done — to build her profile? And are critics of Harris fair, or is she underrated now?


I’m joined by Elaina Plott Calabro, a staff writer at The Atlantic who traveled with Harris extensively for a major profile (https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/11/kamala-harris-vice-presidency-2024-election-biden-age/675439/)  last year. I left this conversation with a very different theory of who Harris is, what her politics are and what led to the confusions of her vice presidency.

# Is Kamala Harris Underrated?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyvaxlKuOuE)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  If Joe Biden steps aside, which is still a very big if, the favorite to replace him is
*  Vice President Kamala Harris.
*  She is quite literally next in line.
*  There are reasons that are obvious for this and reasons that are a little bit more
*  subtle. Like here's one.
*  She would make the transfer of money a lot easier.
*  A Harris led ticket could use all the money that the Biden Harris campaign has raised.
*  Whereas because of how campaign finance law works, if anyone else is a Democratic
*  nominee, that money has to be transferred to the DNC or to a PAC, which would make
*  coordination a whole lot harder.
*  But there's been this longstanding belief in Democratic circles that Harris is a lot
*  weaker than Joe Biden, that he can win the election and she can't.
*  The big evidence for this used to be that she pulled beneath him.
*  That's no longer true.
*  I was looking at the 538 polling averages and she has a very slightly higher approval
*  rating and a significantly lower disapproval rating.
*  There's a new CNN poll.
*  It found Biden losing to Trump by six points, Harris losing by only two points.
*  Other internal Democratic polling has been leaked, including by a group called OpenLabs.
*  Looks there too, like Harris is now outperforming Biden against Donald Trump.
*  In polls before now, she's performed similarly, sometimes a point or two worse.
*  So far, the conventional wisdom has held that Biden may be weak, but Harris is also
*  too weak. But why?
*  There are ways in which Harris seems perfectly suited for this moment.
*  She's a former prosecutor who would be running against a convicted criminal.
*  She's the administration's best messenger on abortion by far, running in the
*  aftermath of DAWBS.
*  She's a black woman with a tough on crime background, running at a moment when crime
*  and disorder have been big issues in American politics.
*  And unlike Joe Biden, who I think has very little room to improve from here, the
*  American people don't really know Harris.
*  The opportunity for her to make a different impression if she was speaking for herself
*  rather than for the administration is real.
*  Now, that doesn't mean she'd be able to pull that off.
*  That's a hard political job.
*  But she's a lot sharper in interviews and debates than I think people are now
*  prepared for. She's a resume and some skills quite well suited to this moment.
*  It definitely doesn't seem impossible that she could rise to the task.
*  There is a reason she was considered so strong in 2019 and in 2020.
*  Wouldn't you want to see her debate Donald Trump?
*  But that still leaves the question of how she ended up with this reputation in the
*  first place, how she went from this meteoric rise, winning a Senate seat in 2016,
*  being taken seriously as a top tier presidential candidate just four years later,
*  getting tapped in for vice president, to being really quickly after that considered
*  a political underachiever.
*  The reason Joe Biden needs to run again rather than the successor he was building
*  that bridge to.
*  Elena Plot Kalabro is a staff writer at The Atlantic who previously covered
*  politics at The New York Times.
*  And in October, she published a really big, really interesting profile of Harris about
*  what had happened during her vice presidency, how that differed from the reputation
*  she had before. And for that, she spent quite a lot of time with Harris and the people
*  who worked with her. So that's to come on the show to unravel the puzzle, maybe even
*  the paradox of Kamala Harris with me.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NY Times dot com.
*  Elena Plot Kalabro, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  So I want to begin with a clip of Vice President Harris defending Joe Biden right after
*  the first presidential debate in this interview with Anderson Cooper.
*  Listen, people can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is
*  the president of the United States has to be about substance.
*  And the contrast is clear.
*  Look at what happened during the course of the debate.
*  Donald Trump lied over and over and over again, as he is want to do.
*  He would not disavow what happened on January 6th.
*  He would not give a clear answer on whether he would stand by the election results this
*  November. He went back and forth about where he stands on one of the most critical
*  issues of freedom in America, which is the right of women to make decisions about their
*  own body. He has been completely ambiguous and all over the place.
*  About where he stands on that issue, despite the fact that he hand selected three
*  members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the
*  protections of Roe v.
*  Wade. And that's exactly what they did.
*  And just three years ago, we commemorated the two year anniversary of Dobbs, wherein
*  women across our country have been denied emergency health care.
*  All that may be true.
*  All that may be true.
*  But the president of the United States was not able to to put make that case to
*  Donald Trump on the stage tonight.
*  So there's something grim there about Cooper basically saying, great, that was a great
*  debate answer. Why wasn't the president able to say what you just said?
*  I think honestly, a lot of people who have followed the vice president closely the past
*  three years were in some ways surprised by that answer.
*  One of the huge reasons for her struggles and her, in my opinion, lack of popularity
*  among many Americans is that she's a very poor communicator when the parameters are
*  quite wide. And what do I mean by that?
*  I mean, when she's on a stage and she's asked about the American experiment, democracy,
*  the state of it, things like that, she really gets lost in the woods when she talks.
*  But a moment like this, when the parameters are quite narrow, when she needs to.
*  And it's such a cliche with her at this point to say it like this.
*  But making the case against someone or something is where I think her confidence truly
*  shows. And when she is actually communicating in a way that doesn't feel instantly
*  clippable for a Republican ad.
*  I want to get at this idea of her as a poor communicator, because in some ways, what has
*  happened to the reputation of Kamala Harris between, you know, let's call it 2019 and 2020
*  when she's a huge rising star and she's running for president and considered in maybe the
*  top tier of the presidential candidates.
*  Nobody's saying, well, this is going to be a disaster.
*  Kamala Harris is a terrible communicator.
*  And then something happens and the whole conventional wisdom in Washington on Kamala Harris
*  undergoes this devolution to she's not a way above replacement politician, but a way
*  below replacement politician.
*  One of the reasons Joe Biden has to run again, no matter how old he is, is she can't carry
*  the load. Why does that happen?
*  Having spent more time than I'd like to admit, combing through every aspect of her career
*  as a public servant, you have to think about, OK, what was she before she ran for president
*  in the primary? She was a senator from California.
*  She had not been in office long at all before she launched her primary bid.
*  Before that, she was attorney general of California.
*  Before that, she was the DA in San Francisco.
*  Let's think then about the DA, because I think this elucidates the point pretty well.
*  When you are running for DA, you are not necessarily trying to capture the imagination
*  of voters. It's very just sort of metrics driven, dry even.
*  And she ran the campaign that way.
*  She said, my opponent, the incumbent, has a very low conviction rate for felonies.
*  I'm going to raise that conviction rate.
*  And because she was so often the first or always rather the first in the jobs that she
*  held, whether that was because of her gender, being South Asian, having black heritage.
*  A lot of times in the era she was running, you'd want to sort of minimize those facts.
*  And I think in San Francisco in particular, in that DA's race, what she wanted to show
*  voters was that she kind of wanted to blend in like background music in a way.
*  Like, I'm the guy that you currently have, but I'm just a lot more competent.
*  And it's sort of that very kind of systematic, practical appeal that works in an office
*  that's really close to the ground in that way.
*  Nobody is looking to their DA to give soaring and inspiring speeches about democracy, and
*  nor are they looking to be sold on a story of someone's life.
*  I mean, I'm sure most Americans in this country couldn't tell you the origin myth of their
*  local district prosecutor or what have you.
*  And she sort of ran her campaign for attorney general that same way.
*  I remember talking to one of her advisors on that campaign and she said they did in
*  fact urge her, you know, share more about your biography, make your personal story
*  more of an aspect of this campaign.
*  And she was resistant to that idea.
*  But she definitely does it more now.
*  She talks about the friend who was molested when she was growing up and she brings that
*  friend into her home and that's part of why she becomes a prosecutor.
*  So when she does tell her story, what is the story she tells?
*  It's interesting that you brought up that story in particular, because I remember an
*  aide coming to me in the midst of reporting my profile on her saying, I just found out
*  a key reason why she became a prosecutor and I'm going to set up an interview so she can
*  tell you about it.
*  So I thought it was quite telling that this person who had been on her team for a while
*  is only now learning this pretty important facet of her path to her career.
*  So she is inherently resistant to trying to sell herself in such a way.
*  But again, with attorney general, that is not the worst thing ever.
*  Governor, it would have been a different story, of course.
*  She gets into the Senate, runs for president, and what you see sort of happen is that her
*  background and sort of her skill set in being a prosecutor, prosecuting the case against
*  Donald Trump, collides with the moment when the national sentiment toward police and law
*  enforcement in general is quite grim.
*  And you have those around her, like her sister, Maya Harris, who say you kind of drop the
*  prosecutor thing.
*  This is not something that voters want to be reminded of.
*  She wrote a book when she was in California called Smart on Crime, which really, you know,
*  you read it, it sounds more like a tough on crime book.
*  But that was no longer relevant, as her advisors told her, to her interest in the presidential
*  campaign.
*  And so what happened was her communication became so clearly reflective of someone that she
*  herself didn't recognize, if that makes sense.
*  When she is able to kind of step into that mode, she feels comfortable where she feels more like
*  a district attorney again, like you saw in hearings with Brett Kavanaugh or Jeff Sessions,
*  when her star really started to explode.
*  When you and I met, I brought up the incident in Charlottesville, where as you know, there was a
*  rally by white supremacists that left a young woman dead.
*  You will recall that the president who nominated you described the incident by saying, quote,
*  I think there is blame on both sides.
*  So I think this will be a simple question for you.
*  Do you, sir, believe there was blame on both sides?
*  Senator, we did talk and I enjoyed our meeting and to talk about the history of this country.
*  And we talked about that at some length and talked about discrimination.
*  I appreciated your opening statement yesterday where you talked about your experience.
*  One of the principles I've articulated throughout this hearing is the independence of the
*  judiciary.
*  I'm sorry, I'd appreciate it if you'd answer the question.
*  Oh, yeah, I am, Senator.
*  So one of the principles I've talked about throughout this hearing is the independence
*  of the judiciary.
*  And one of the things judges do following the lead of the chief justice and what all the
*  judges do is not stay out of current events, stay out of commenting on current events because
*  risks confusion about what our role is.
*  We are judges who decide cases and controversy.
*  We're not pundits, so we don't comment on current events.
*  We stay out of political controversy.
*  If, with all due respect, I only have limited time.
*  Are you saying that it's too difficult a question or it's a question you can't answer,
*  which is whether you agree with the statement that there was blame on both sides?
*  We can move on.
*  But are you saying you cannot answer that simple, pretty simple question?
*  I think that's the flavor we're starting to see again.
*  But the interim has, I mean, it's just been a struggle because she that's never been
*  how she thinks of politics.
*  You open your profile with a kind of very telling story that I've also heard from others
*  about getting a tour of the art in the vice president's residence.
*  Do you want to talk through that?
*  Yeah.
*  So I went to meet with a vice president at her residence for about an hour and a half.
*  And when I got in there, she gave me a tour of the residence.
*  So like past vice president, she's completely redesigned it, hired someone to
*  come in and help her affect her vision.
*  And she wanted to show me all of the artwork that she'd included.
*  And what I found pretty interesting right off the bat was that as she was describing
*  these pieces, she said nothing about what it made her feel, what attracted her to it.
*  The artistry itself is probably a better way to say it.
*  She would just point to it and say, this is by a Japanese American artist.
*  This is by a gay artist.
*  And sort of took me through an identitarian walkthrough of the art on display in her home.
*  And never said anything else about it.
*  And she ends it with, so you get the idea.
*  So you get what I'm going for here was the meaning of that.
*  And yeah, it was telling.
*  I mean, there was a reason I started my piece with that anecdote.
*  But I also think to me, it's the sort of thing that reflected, I think, her desire at times
*  to say what she thinks the base of the party wants to hear, which is where a lot of her
*  communication fumbles, I think, come from.
*  I think a lot of times that she is very scared of saying something wrong and going counter
*  to the base as opposed to just saying rather forthrightly how she feels about something.
*  You're not the only person who's gotten that exact tour and had that exact reaction to it.
*  And it's why I focus on this.
*  It's obviously a very small thing.
*  But there is this way.
*  Maybe it's because it's not actually her politics.
*  I think it's a really interesting argument you're making here and that I think might
*  be true, right?
*  That she's actually speaking this era of the Democratic Party with an accent, to use that
*  metaphor.
*  That's a nice way to put it.
*  Yeah.
*  That, in fact, the reason the symbolism is a little bit blunt force is it's not her natural
*  politics.
*  She's not just running to be the first.
*  She doesn't come out of that era in Democratic Party politics.
*  She comes out of this era when it made sense in SF to be a kind of smart on crime, tough
*  on crime prosecutor, to brag about your conviction record, to say that the people you're running
*  against don't have enough convictions, right?
*  To say that you have compassion, but you also have steel to you.
*  And that as she tried to refashion herself for an era that did not allow her to make
*  that set of arguments and an era in which there was extraordinary excitement about
*  a black Indian American woman after Obama.
*  I mean, people wanted her to pan out.
*  They wanted Kamala Harris to be the next chapter in the history that seemed to be happening
*  when the party elected Obama in 2008 and 2012.
*  And I think she tried to shape herself into that.
*  And I guess what you're saying here, which is interesting and maybe speaks to why that's
*  sort of an awkward tour she gives people, is that it's an awkward fit, not just for the
*  person on the tour, but maybe also for her.
*  To me, that's absolutely the case.
*  And I'll return again to her presidential primary bid, which is where I think this theme
*  sort of crystallized.
*  I remember talking to aides on that campaign, or former aides, this would have been after
*  the fact, who said that when she started getting advice from people closest to her saying,
*  this is a different moment and the Democratic Party, your background should not be your
*  selling point, that her response was essentially, but I am a prostitute.
*  That's what I've done.
*  That is who I am.
*  So what story do I tell instead?
*  It's not like I had a detour at some point where I went from smart on crime to actually
*  just kidding, change my mind, here's the new book.
*  There wasn't really an authentic pivot for her to make.
*  So when she sort of advised and takes that advice to heart, that who she is is not what
*  that iteration of the party wants.
*  She tries to reshape herself.
*  And that's why, I mean, let's talk about the question of authenticity.
*  That's something that I think is really fraught often with racist and quite often sexist
*  stereotypes, things like that.
*  But voters really did pick up on something about Kamala Harris that just felt inauthentic
*  when she spoke.
*  I think it was David Axelrod in my story who just said voters can pick up on that when
*  it doesn't feel honesty is not even the right word.
*  I think, you know, telling a lie about your record or something, but just
*  misrepresenting who you are or what it is that you really want to be saying.
*  She has reminded me of something that was true about Hillary Clinton, which is both
*  of them struggled with this question of authenticity, struggled to seem like they were themselves
*  giving a big speech.
*  And then when you'd meet them privately, I don't know that I've ever met a politician
*  where I felt there was a bigger gap between the sort of charisma on the stump and the
*  charisma around a table than Kamala Harris.
*  Clinton had that dimension to her too, but you know, Harris is like, she's extremely
*  warm and magnetic and profane, much more so than a lot of politicians who I know.
*  You actually would want to have a beer with her.
*  You'd like want to go to the barbecue or the party she hosted.
*  But you don't see that version of her out in public all that often.
*  And I don't blame her for why, right?
*  I think this is like, there's a long history of seeing this, whereas like Joe Biden or
*  Donald Trump can just go like, let it all hang out.
*  And then they seem authentic.
*  But this feels to me like a place where there is a real, I mean, there is something lurking
*  behind the public persona that if she were able to unleash it, at least in what I've
*  seen, I think would be actually quite compelling.
*  And what I will say is that having traveled to so many events with her and actually seeing
*  her interact with voters one-on-one, you do see that person.
*  And this goes back to something I feel pretty strongly about, which is that when she is on
*  a stage in front of a big audience and is expected to talk about sort of gauzy questions of
*  democracy and things like that, she just doesn't do well.
*  Even broad questions like, what does this administration see as the future of climate
*  change?
*  It's something that I think once she gets in a smaller group and she's able to really
*  level with the person that she's speaking to and has eyes on them, she, I think, becomes
*  a completely different person.
*  She's far more comfortable.
*  And that's what I experienced in the residence.
*  I mean, this was someone who I found to be almost maternal.
*  You know, at one point she says to me, it's not even a question.
*  You're newly married.
*  I said, yes, Madam Vice President.
*  And she said, pay attention to your marriage, your relationships, because life has a way
*  of sweeping you up.
*  And it was just something I had never seen from her on the stage, I think is the important
*  distinction, that aura around her.
*  Where I had seen it was one-on-one with voters.
*  And when I spoke with Hillary Clinton for this story, she said specifically, Kamala
*  Harris is not a performance politician.
*  I didn't take that to be a criticism.
*  She's not a performance politician either.
*  But her point was that she said, you know, when I was running for Senate, I did a lot
*  of these really small roundtables with voters all across New York.
*  The media had no interest in that.
*  And this is a complaint you will hear a lot from Kamala Harris's aides.
*  She is, in fact, out there.
*  Yes, she does travel a lot.
*  I've gone with her for a lot of these stops and is talking to people, interacting with
*  voters.
*  But they're like, nobody's coming with us on Air Force 2.
*  We can't get any of these major outlets to come do it.
*  And so Kamala Harris, she said to me, you know, my career was not about giving lovely
*  speeches.
*  It was about working with my constituents in whatever capacity I was in.
*  And that's great.
*  But on a national stage, there's simply no way that the media can package that fact and
*  sell it for you.
*  Lovely speeches is a large part of the ballgame when you were in the White House.
*  You mentioned that book Smart on Crime.
*  You mentioned it reads from maybe our current perspective is tough on crime.
*  What does she say in that book?
*  How would you describe it?
*  Well, think about her record in California.
*  She was not shy about prosecuting people for marijuana usage.
*  And it's one of the reasons you saw quite the backlash.
*  I don't know if you'll recall, Ezra, the moment when she's asked, I think it was on a podcast,
*  have you ever smoked marijuana?
*  And she starts laughing and says something to the effect of what kind of question is
*  that, you know, I'm Jamaican.
*  And that might have been funny.
*  But what a lot of people I think correctly pointed out is that, well, the thing that
*  you're laughing about is the thing that you were quite eager to move against in your
*  positions of power in California.
*  That today is not something that she's going to want to talk about again.
*  But I remember talking to David Axelrod for my profile.
*  This was last fall.
*  And he said there's such a title shift in a way where there's a vacuum for somebody to
*  step in and say, I am a progressive, but the Democratic Party can have the answer for crime.
*  And he was sort of astonished that she hadn't stepped in to kind of claim that role.
*  This to me is the paradox of her.
*  It might ultimately be the tragedy of her because Harris runs in 2020 at this exact
*  moment when her precise political profile is disastrous with the Democratic Party.
*  Right.
*  It's post Ferguson.
*  It's post Black Lives Matter.
*  George Floyd is yet to come.
*  But we're already in this moment where what you want to be is not a smart on crime Democrat.
*  It's a criminal justice reformer.
*  But when I go back right now, because preparing for the show, I was reading a bunch of older
*  political profiles of Harris and I was reading this one from the New Yorker in 2019.
*  And they describe her then as quote, a black female law and order Democrat.
*  And when you imagine the candidate Democrats would want to run this year,
*  I mean, it's concerned about crime, concerned about disorder at the border, running against
*  a convicted criminal in Donald Trump at the moment that the Supreme Court is saying
*  that the president can functionally do almost anything they want.
*  A black female law and order Democrat is the profile that you would grow in a lab.
*  And it's not clear to me, can she re-inhabit it?
*  Can she find that again?
*  Does she still believe in any of that?
*  But it seems very, rather than Harris in some ways seeming ill-suited for the moment,
*  most of her political history seems perfectly suited for the moment.
*  I agree with that so strongly.
*  And another thing I feel so strongly about is that her perhaps not inhabiting that role that
*  should seem so natural and so intuitive in this moment in particular, I think is a failure of
*  President Biden.
*  I thought a lot about how when they came into office, they really didn't have a vision for her
*  vice presidency.
*  And part of that was by virtue of how she was chosen.
*  She was not selected as a governing partner.
*  People like Jim Clyburn, who has known Biden for quite a long time, is quite close with him,
*  urges him expressly to pick a black woman as vice president.
*  And that's great.
*  But coming into the presidency, the White House, you have to sort of take time to set out,
*  okay, what role do you actually want the vice president to fill as a governing partner?
*  There are some reasons that are understandable for that not happening immediately.
*  One was COVID.
*  They came into office.
*  It was all hands on deck.
*  But another thing that I found pretty fascinating is that the role that vice presidents have
*  typically been asked to fill, and I say typically in the past 20 years or so, 25 years, is a
*  liaison to Capitol Hill, a kind of anchor to Washington for the outsider-ish president.
*  So you think about Dick Cheney for George W. Bush.
*  You think about Joe Biden for Barack Obama.
*  I think most notably, Barack Obama was quite candid that he did not like the task of going
*  on Capitol Hill and trying to negotiate to push his legislative agenda forward.
*  Joe Biden loves that.
*  And so you had sort of this paradox that Kamala Harris comes in as this person who was like
*  10 years old when Joe Biden ran his first campaign for the Senate.
*  There's no world in which it makes sense to try to frame her as the Capitol Hill whisperer
*  of the Biden administration.
*  But in fact, that's what they tried to do at first.
*  And I think it was just because they saw the historical pattern.
*  They didn't know what else to really do with her because they hadn't really put enough
*  thought into it.
*  And she failed quite miserably in that role.
*  Again, as I mentioned, she was in the Senate a rather short time before she launched her
*  primary bid.
*  She had not built up the relational capital with lawmakers to be someone who could come
*  in and really make things happen.
*  And so you saw, which I think was quite embarrassing for her, that early on, Joe Biden said,
*  OK, I'm going to go with you to these meetings, almost like a chaperone to the point that it
*  became just Joe Biden going to meet with someone like Senator Sinema or Senator Manchin to try
*  to get them on board on his voting rights package.
*  So that visit out quite quickly.
*  And I think you were then left with a vice president drifting in the wind.
*  And to me, it was so interesting about how probably Joe Biden's worst answer, one of the
*  worst kind of moments of the debate that we saw, was his inability to speak coherently
*  about abortion.
*  And it is that exact fact that indicates why we even have some sense of what Kamala Harris's
*  profile of her vice presidency has been.
*  In anticipation of the overturning throw, Biden, who does not feel comfortable talking
*  about abortion, certainly not hitting the campaign trail and talking about it, suddenly
*  that was the vacuum for her to fill.
*  And it was by happenstance in many ways, right?
*  So the lack of planning, I think, has sort of brought Kamala Harris to where she is today.
*  The West Wing has never really cared to think strategically about how to present her to
*  the American public.
*  And what I found in my reporting is, unfortunately, one reason was that when you ask Joe Biden's
*  aides, is she ready to step in and be president?
*  They don't want to engage the question because they feel that in doing so, they would legitimize
*  the implication that she might, in fact, need to step in for Joe Biden, which just goes
*  back to sort of what everybody is talking about today, that those around him have sort
*  of gaslit and bullied reporters who dared bring up the fact of his age.
*  And I think that has translated directly to how people have tried to cover the vice president
*  or understand the vice president.
*  But Biden has wanted to serve a second term.
*  I've heard many people say that it was almost a stroke of genius for them to choose a weak vice
*  president because if they'd chosen a stronger vice president, the pressure on him to step
*  aside would have been much greater.
*  But if they had had a serious strategy to bulk up Harris's profile, to make her seem
*  presidential to people, to give her victories, to say, maybe you don't want Joe Biden out
*  there doing a lot of adversarial interviews and YouTube shows and podcasts, but you could
*  send Harris out there.
*  She's a good interviewer.
*  She makes mistakes like everybody, but she's actually quite strong in my view.
*  I've listened to a bunch of her interviews, but they didn't want to do that.
*  I'm not saying this was all a strategy, but in terms of their incentives and Joe Biden's
*  incentives, he didn't want people coming to the conclusion that he'd done a great job
*  in the first term, but he had this excellent vice president.
*  And given that most Americans thought he was too old for a second term, he should step
*  aside.
*  He wanted people to feel that he was the only one who could beat Donald Trump.
*  I think that's right, but what people, I think, latched onto pretty quickly and correctly so,
*  I think, is Joe Biden positioned himself publicly as wanting to be a bridge to the next generation
*  of democratic leadership from the outset of his presidency.
*  So however he felt privately, he was on the record saying that this is not about me, this
*  is about the country, this is about saving democracy, all of the things we would expect
*  a politician to say.
*  But the fact that particularly when it came to that bridge comment, that that was followed
*  up by really not much of a cursory effort to promote a fuller, more successful portrait
*  of Kamala Harris to the American people.
*  I think that dissonance is partially responsible for what we see now.
*  I want to zoom in on the moment he picks Harris.
*  So as I remember the Veep Stakes, you had a couple of people who were really in contention
*  towards the end.
*  Tammy Duckworth, who they really liked, who's a senator, a wounded war hero.
*  Elizabeth Warren was in contention.
*  Karen Bass, who's now the mayor of Los Angeles.
*  Amy Klobuchar was in the mix at different points.
*  I mean, there were a lot of people they were talking to, could have spoken to.
*  He ends up settling on Harris.
*  He ends up settling on Harris even though of everybody in the primary, she dealt him
*  the most vicious blow in a debate and a blow that I think his campaign felt and then was
*  able to argue effectively was unfair, this sort of attack on busing.
*  You know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate
*  her public schools, and she was bused to school every day.
*  And that little girl was me.
*  So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.
*  We have to take it seriously.
*  We have to act swiftly.
*  Which then their campaign got people to ask her, what is your position on busing?
*  And frankly, it wasn't actually that different than Joe Biden's.
*  But so she's able to surmount that.
*  Why does he choose her?
*  When it came down to, and I want to point to the busing, how many again, this was pretty
*  hard for Jill Biden to get past.
*  She, I think far more than Joe Biden himself, had trouble sort of digesting the idea that
*  his running mate would be somebody that she saw as having attacked him so relentlessly
*  and unfairly in the primary season.
*  My understanding is that when it came down to Karen Bass versus Kamala Harris, they simply
*  thought that Kamala Harris would do a better job.
*  And then when she comes in, they do give her certain portfolios.
*  And there's been a lot of debate in Washington among political people I know about why they
*  give her certain portfolios.
*  So they give her immigration, which is a very, very, very difficult portfolio.
*  They give her voting rights, which my understanding is she wanted, but also they did not have
*  the votes to pass the voting rights bills they wanted to pass.
*  They did not have votes to get rid of the filibuster and they did not have the votes
*  to surmount a filibuster.
*  At one point they gave her the AI portfolio, which is very strange.
*  There's been a sense that even outside this question of putting her out there and putting
*  her out in front, that she wasn't being given projects that were actually winnable, right?
*  In the way that Al Gore got reinventing government, which he could be out there on the talk shows
*  talking about and scoring wins on.
*  Joe Biden was a key negotiator on very important bills in Congress.
*  There were a lot of deals that Joe Biden could fairly say that he was the person who in the
*  end got to the finish line with Mitch McConnell, but they were giving her things that everybody
*  knew at the beginning there was not going to be a signing ceremony.
*  Why was that?
*  Immigration, I think, is a pretty fascinating illustration of this whole theme in general.
*  It's telling, right, that you immediately say immigration and don't specify the so-called
*  root causes issue.
*  What does that mean?
*  That means your portfolio is ostensibly trying to grapple with things like impoverished
*  conditions and crime from Central American countries that are actually causing these
*  migrants to flee north to begin with.
*  The way that that assignment came about, and this speaks to, I think, just the lack of
*  broader strategy that the West Wing had when it came to her, as Ron Klain, Joe Biden's
*  former chief of staff, told me, they were in a meeting talking about this very issue.
*  Kamala Harris, as Klain told me, spoke rather forcefully and rather well about her ideas for
*  alleviating some of these root cause elements.
*  Joe Biden was impressed with her ideas.
*  He essentially said, why don't you take that issue?
*  Why don't you take it on?
*  She's kind of silent for a moment.
*  After the meeting, she approaches Klain and says, I'm really happy to be engaged on this,
*  but I was sort of throwing those things out there in the hopes that someone else could
*  take them on and not me, because it is just a completely no-win issue.
*  To the extent that you can, as a governing leader, help alleviate those root causes,
*  that's a 10, 15-year-at-minimum metric.
*  Kamala Harris's vice president is going to fix El Salvador?
*  Yes. Word is out on whether that has happened yet.
*  Ron Klain says, look, I get it, but, and here's the important part,
*  when Joe Biden was vice president, this was the issue he took on for Barack Obama.
*  He didn't even see it as like, oh, I'm saddling her with the thing that I don't want to do or
*  sort of the scraps. He saw it as a great sign of respect that he would take the issue that he had
*  worked on for Barack Obama and feel enough confidence in her that he would want to give
*  it to her as well. So completely divorced from questions like, can she make any meaningful,
*  just optically, a sense of a win on an issue like this, and what does that mean for her profile as
*  a vice president? Things like that were just not coming into the equation at all.
*  And so you have that, and then you have voting rights, which are correct. She did want that.
*  But even from the outset, she knew that a voting rights package was not passing the Senate. It
*  just wasn't. And because she didn't have the relationships on Capitol Hill that would be
*  needed to actually realize the chance of getting it to the president's desk, that was just another
*  thing that even though she felt comfortable speaking about it and the need for it, again,
*  there was no signing ceremony that was ever going to accompany that.
*  On immigration, this is a place where she also did herself no favors. I mentioned in general that I
*  think she's a stronger communicator than is currently her reputation. But here she gave
*  one of her first major interviews to Lester Holt. And it was genuinely a bit of a debacle.
*  Do you have any plans to visit the border?
*  I'm here in Guatemala today. At some point, you know, we are going to the border. We've been to
*  the border. So this whole thing about the border, we've been to the border. We've been to the border.
*  You haven't been to the border.
*  And I haven't been to Europe. And I don't understand the point that you're making.
*  So this, for me, was one of the places we began to feel the sense of her turn in Washington,
*  right? The sense that maybe actually she wasn't quite ready for prime time.
*  What was your sense of what happened there?
*  Okay, I'd like to focus first on the reaction from the White House to that interview. What many aides
*  I spoke to couldn't understand was why when the questions were so easily anticipated, she had
*  failed to the degree that she had. But to me, that's almost less important because yes, the
*  interview itself was quite the debacle. But I think what really allowed it to snowball into something
*  that we are still talking about today, all these years later, is that for many Americans,
*  it was their first introduction to Kamala Harris, just in general. I keep saying again, I know she
*  was not in the Senate a very long time before she launched her primary bid. But I think it's so
*  important in that she did not have really a built in profile with Americans to lean back on and be
*  able to interpret an interview like that and say, everybody messes up sometimes. But I know Kamala
*  Harris because of these other reasons and I have faith in her. The second thing we saw, and again,
*  another reason that it became the debacle it did, is that she pretty much retreated from public view
*  afterward. I think Elizabeth Warren is a great example of a candidate who while on the campaign
*  trail, her team really understood that if she had a bad interview, just blanket the airwaves afterward.
*  Just do more and more and more until people can't even remember what the issue was in the interview
*  from eight days ago or whatever it was. Kamala Harris didn't do that. Now that's not to say that
*  people like Ron Klain didn't encourage her otherwise, but she became really terrified of
*  making another mistake of that magnitude that rather than sort of getting out there and
*  talking and talking and talking until it just seemed like another interview, who even remembers,
*  it became one of the few interviews she even did that entire year and certainly that entire summer.
*  And so it just took on an outsize importance that was probably never in proportion to the mistakes
*  in the interview itself, if that makes sense. I don't remember if it's in your profile,
*  but something Klain says about her is that she bears the weight of embarrassing or subbing up
*  for the administration very heavily. That one of the things that made her more cautious in this
*  period is it's one thing to be running your own campaign and screw up. It's another thing to be
*  out there as a supporting player and screw up and making the person sort of at the top of the ticket
*  or at the top of the White House look bad. And that created a real, I mean, she's always been
*  known as a bit of a cautious politician, but that created a real fear of failure in her.
*  And also, she has some strictures on her as a vice president, right? If she begins going out
*  and doing constant interviews, the White House, which I think has, as I was saying before,
*  let's call it a mixed relationship to what level of prominence she should have,
*  might not have been thrilled about her becoming an omnipresent media figure.
*  So yes, that was my profile where Klain made that point. Harris' aides, though,
*  their frustration was that because she felt that so strongly, and it's a completely valid reaction
*  to have, I'm a supporting player here. I do not want to distract from this administration's agenda
*  by flubbing in interviews and having that become the headline or the thing that's showing up on
*  Saturday Night Live or something like that. What her aides were frustrated by was that
*  knowing that she was feeling that way, that she was becoming interminably more cautious, it seemed,
*  as a result of that, that was the moment they felt when the West Wing really could have stepped in
*  and tried to help promote her. So she was never, by the way, she was never going to go on a media
*  blitz just on her own accord in an effort to fix it herself. That was something that the West Wing,
*  if it was going to happen, that they would have to be the engine behind. And the appetite for that
*  collectively was just never really there. I want to talk about some other things that begin to
*  shape, I think, her public profile in this period. And one relates to that relationship with the West
*  Wing. You begin getting these stories pretty regularly about staff turmoil in the vice
*  president's office, about chaos in the vice president's office, about her churning through
*  her people. You know, you're hearing it in background quotes from administration officials,
*  you're hearing it in these stories and in Politico and the Washington Post. And there was a sense
*  that something was wrong, even in the small part of the White House or the administration, rather,
*  that Vice President Harris was in charge of running. How do you understand those stories?
*  What was wrong? I mean, were they were they picking up on something real? And how big of a
*  deal was it really? I think what the West Wing just based on our reporting saw as wrong was just
*  sort of amorphous. This idea that when she went out in public, you were sort of always at the edge
*  of your seat, not for a good reason, but because you didn't quite know where a sentence might go.
*  And that's how I feel about Joe Biden.
*  And that came to be real. Again, it's sort of a more amorphous thing, but there was not one specific
*  thing where they thought, you know, she's incapable of doing this. It was just a general,
*  this is a headache every time she goes out there. But I will say that when reporters would talk to
*  the West Wing about that, rather than take an opportunity just on paper to constantly
*  reinforce their support of her, they just didn't do that. And when you would insert the age angle
*  in particular, do you have confidence in this person to step in should something happen?
*  They took issue with the implication of the question and spent more time, I think, berating
*  the mere ask rather than using it as an opportunity to elevate their confidence in her.
*  But there was something more being said in these stories, which was that there was turmoil in her
*  office, that she was losing staff, that there was some kind of chaos in her management. There was a
*  kind of suggestion that that had been true maybe in her Senate office too. Was it being managed
*  very badly? Was there a problem between her and her staff? At the outset, there absolutely was.
*  And the internal narrative in her office as to why that was, was that she was really working with
*  a group of people that she didn't really have longstanding relationships with. And I think that
*  so many people had competing ideas of what her vice presidency should be, that a lot of the
*  chaos you saw at the beginning was just clashing ideas and her inability to sort of say, we're
*  going this way or we're going that way. One of the aides that left during that turmoil of the first
*  year, I remember her telling me that the boss that she had worked for on Capitol Hill before
*  she went to work for Kamala Harris as vice president, she said, I worked for a representative who,
*  if everybody was screaming with a million different ideas, this person would just say,
*  we're doing this, we're doing this and you're all getting on board and we're sticking to it.
*  She was not good at doing that is what I'm told. She just didn't have the confidence yet to say,
*  this is what the plan is. Let me ask you about another dimension of this. So you talked earlier
*  about Joe Biden saying he was going to be a bridge to the next generation of Democratic Party leaders.
*  There's always this question though of a bridge to which faction of the party. Now the party is more
*  united, I think, than it was in 2020 when you had the sort of Democratic socialist squad dimension
*  of it. You had the sort of rising Black Lives Matter, post George Floyd, there was overlap here,
*  but you could call it more woke, you could call it more built around identity and ethnicity.
*  You had the moderates, which Joe Biden was a part of, and I think we're seen as maybe
*  still an important force, but a thing that was draining of its power. Obama was held in a little
*  less esteem at that moment, I think, inside at least the commentariat than he is right now.
*  So it's this question of to what Biden was going to build a bridge. He picks Harris after George
*  Floyd's murder. And I think that pick also reflects a sense of what the next iteration of
*  the party was going to be, right? It was not going to be a party that was going to be nominating
*  old white guys to be the nominee. It was going to be a party that was more fully embracing a sort of
*  anti-racism, more fully embracing the politics that felt very dominant in that moment. It always
*  seemed to me that's the reason that Amy Klobuchar didn't do better in the Veep Stakes and a reason
*  that Harris seemed like a sensible pick for them. On the one hand, she wasn't too far away from
*  their politics, but on the other hand, it seemed like she directionally could represent this.
*  And then pretty quickly, that politics loses its energy. A backlash builds. There's increasingly
*  a sense that what Joe Biden is, is more like the future than the past. If you could find somebody
*  like Joe Biden, but younger, that would be a strong candidate. And so one thing that seemed to me to
*  happen in the ripples of Washington, D.C. was that the thing that Biden was building a bridge to
*  seemed at one point to be the politics Harris represented or could lead. And all of a sudden,
*  it wasn't the politics that Harris represented or could lead. And so it almost seemed to many people
*  like they had picked their vice president on a political theory that had just proven wrong,
*  that if they had picked Tammy Duckworth or an Amy Klobuchar, that would have been more in keeping
*  with where people now thought the politics of the future were sitting. Do you think that's true?
*  Going back to something we discussed earlier about why did he pick her? You know, you mentioned her
*  as somebody different from Amy Klobuchar, and certainly that was the persona. She was projecting
*  a quite different persona from Amy Klobuchar. But I think one of the reasons that Joe Biden picked her
*  and that they would click in conversations is they're not altogether that far apart on policy.
*  To me, the true Kamala Harris is someone, a Democrat who is much more pragmatic than
*  the idea of her has become. And I understand why that idea exists. But it makes it all
*  more so that, you know, the party has changed. And as we've been saying, the change is almost
*  designed just to lift her up in sort of what I think is the core of who she is as a politician
*  and the core of her ideological approach to governing.
*  There's a way in which I think the picture you're helping me clarify is that she became a cipher
*  twice. Once when she runs in 2020 and realizes that her entire record, her entire positioning,
*  her beliefs, her experience are ill suited for the political moment. And again, she becomes
*  vice president. And that is always a collapse into being a cipher because you have to be
*  whatever the administration needs you to be. You have to be on board with whatever the president
*  is doing, right? You almost by definition in that job cannot be yourself. You cannot go out and
*  shift the way you're seen. You can't decide on new policies, make big pivots, right? You really very
*  little control of your public persona. And so you have this person who had a very clear political
*  identity, lost it in 2020, wins the vice presidency, but at the cost of losing that
*  identity even more. And now everybody's like, who is Kamala Harris? And the answer is a little bit
*  unclear because it's been a little bit since she was able to carve out a public version of herself
*  that is authentic to whoever she is now.
*  That's again a reason that I think the Lester Hold interview became the catastrophe really
*  that it was. It was never about just the one interview. It was about it inevitably being the
*  entree of sorts of her to the American people that she had never really quite achieved before. There
*  was no backdrop really against which for Americans to judge her in that moment. So I will say that
*  sometimes I've wondered about her. Why is she doing this? I mean, she clearly just found such
*  joy from her days as a prosecutor. And I mean, her whole tenor changes when you're talking with her
*  about that and what she loved about that job that sometimes it's like, why are you going for this
*  as you're just getting further and further away from the more intimate grassroots settings that
*  really seem to bring you joy and professional fulfillment?
*  There's been this feeling among Democrats for some time. You might think Joe Biden is too old
*  for this, but Harris is definitely a weaker candidate. It doesn't look obvious to me at
*  this point after that debate that she is a weaker candidate than Joe Biden. At the very least,
*  she seems to me to have a lot more room to go up. Maybe she has more room to fall too. I guess
*  that's possible though in a CNN poll that came out this morning, Biden was six points behind Trump
*  and Harris was two points behind Trump, but I've seen that go in different directions.
*  But I'm curious if you have a view on this because there was a hardened conventional wisdom that
*  she's a weaker candidate than Biden. But now that seems like a very open question.
*  Well, and the reason it's no longer such an open question is not just because of Biden's failure,
*  but because where we are in the campaign, you know, assuming she'll do a vice presidential debate,
*  she performs best when she is in conversation with someone about something very specific.
*  I don't mean to harp on that over and over, but the trend I would see of her when I was on the
*  road with her is she'd get on stage at say Georgia Tech where she's talking to these college students
*  about climate change and on stage are two professors, two scientists. And when they're
*  asking her questions, those are those edge of the seat moments and not in a good way.
*  But about halfway through when she is in those conversations, she essentially takes the mic
*  and starts directing the conversation herself. She'll start asking, what about your background?
*  What got you interested in this? And it's when she feels that control and that she's more in
*  conversation with somebody instead of just being asked question, her answering asked another
*  question. I think that's when she performs better. And she also starts to actually speak in much more
*  precise terms about whatever agenda item it is that she's on stage, they're trying to sell.
*  And I think that's why on a debate stage, even for what happened the other day,
*  has just always been quite well suited to her. One of the difficulties, I think, if Biden decides
*  not to run, Harris is by far the favorite, right? I don't know if he would actively endorse her or
*  just kind of signal that he thinks she's great, but she's either way the favorite to win any
*  convention, he could actively endorse her and functionally hand her the nomination, hell, he
*  could resign and hand her the presidency. But she'd have to do something very tricky, which is
*  usually when a vice president runs, they have a whole campaign to redefine themselves. Joe Biden
*  had the entire 2020 campaign to show that he was obviously a huge fan of Barack Obama, very proud
*  of his service, but not exactly Barack Obama. You can think of George H.W. Bush, you can think of
*  Al Gore, sometimes it goes well, sometimes it doesn't. But usually they have quite a long time,
*  the whole sort of interminable American presidential cycle, to show people who they are.
*  What Harris would have to do if Biden dropped out is reconstruct or construct this entire
*  political persona beyond just being Joe Biden's vice president, like extremely fast, which I don't
*  think is completely impossible. People be very interested to see what she has to say. They would
*  really tune in for that convention speech, they would really tune in for her interviews,
*  but it would rely on her and the people around her knowing what it is she wanted to say,
*  knowing what it is she thought American politics was about right now, knowing what it is she
*  thought the questions were about. Do you have any sense of what you think that would look like,
*  or if she's up to it? I think it's a big ask in large part because she and her team have been
*  so relentlessly on message, even off the record, that this administration is not about her and what
*  she wants. To the point, again, even off the record, when you say, well, let's just take a gander,
*  what does she want? What would she do as president? The question just feels irrelevant to them because
*  it's not, they say it's not the point. And again, this is even off the record. So I think she'd be
*  coming in with Americans who, one, don't really have a great idea of who she is just as a person,
*  what her origin story is, her biography, anything like that, nor just inherently by virtue of the
*  fact that she's been vice president, would they have a great idea of what she wanted to accomplish
*  as president? My sense, just having gotten to know her, is that she would have a bit of a tough time
*  at first probably breaking out of a we, saying our administration. I mean, those things just become
*  habitual for a vice president, quite obviously. And I think for her to have to suddenly make the
*  transition to here is what I would do, that is an adjustment that I think can't be overlooked in
*  terms of, I mean, there are growing pains involved with that. How about simply the capacity she has
*  to prosecute a case against Donald Trump? I mean, one of the things that has been
*  on my mind about her sort of unusual potential fit for right now is so much of what swirls around
*  Donald Trump is legal as opposed to policy, right? So much of certainly the way Democrats are thinking
*  about Donald Trump in terms of the criminal cases, in terms of the recent series of Supreme Court
*  rulings is about boundaries of legality, about what it means to have a convicted criminal in the
*  White House. Is that a case she is well suited to make? I think it is. And I think my addendum to
*  whether she in this short time could sell Americans on herself and her agenda,
*  that's important, but I almost don't know that she would need to at this point, where we are
*  in this political moment. I think a lot of people in this country, casting a vote for them would be
*  about casting it against Donald Trump, maybe not necessarily for someone. Her strength, I think,
*  would be in prosecuting a case against him such that that becomes her profile, if that makes sense.
*  Getting on a debate stage with Donald Trump, as people saw with her questioning Brett Kavanaugh
*  and just the overwhelming excitement that attended those events would translate well here.
*  I think the difference would be, you know, is she somebody who by virtue of making that case, can
*  she excite people to actually vote for the Democrats versus just staying home? I don't know that it's
*  about her performance could seed voters to Donald Trump. I think it's a good place to end. So then
*  always our final question. What are three books you'd recommend to the audience? So the first book
*  I recommend is called Southerners by Marshall Freedy. It's an anthology, actually, of a lot of
*  the profiles and general essays that Marshall Freedy, who was a reporter for Newsweek and
*  Harper's, New York Review of Books, several places in the mid-century during the civil rights era,
*  he is the kind of writer who you read him and you almost become angry because you just know
*  you will never be that good at a Senate's level. His sentences are, they almost dance off the page
*  and so just the prose is really compelling. But what I love about his approach to political reporting
*  is I think sometimes in the, and maybe this is like the politico-ification of
*  political coverage today, there's a tendency to almost want to treat our elected leaders
*  as sort of omniscient and omnipotent and work from that premise as opposed to this idea that
*  these are people who a lot of just really don't know what they're doing, monkeys fighting for the
*  same crown. And I think Marshall Freedy in taking that latter approach gets at the truth of the
*  characters he's writing about much more effectively and sort of showing them as the sort of slap-dash
*  figures they so often are. So whether you want to read about Lester Maddox, the Huey Long family,
*  it's highly recommend. Okay. My second is The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles, which I would
*  describe as a novel about existential despair if that entices any listeners, but it's about
*  three Americans, three New Yorkers who go to North Africa and are thinking of it as sort of
*  just a tourist jaunt. The couple in there is hoping that it will rekindle their romance and
*  sort of come in and Paul Bowles writes about these themes often, the romantic notions of
*  travelers to quote unquote exotic places. And the book then very darkly chronicles
*  sort of their descent into despair as their ignorance of cultures come to be realized to them.
*  The third I would recommend is The Company She Keeps by Mary McCarthy. This was McCarthy's debut
*  novel. It's not quite exactly an anthology, even though some of the chapters in there were first
*  published in places like Harper's Bazaar. But this book is about Meg Sargent, who just very obviously
*  an autobiographical character of a Catholic girl who post college goes to New York to try to work
*  for a new Republic nation equivalent and try to make something of herself in the city's boho
*  intellectual culture dips into Trotskyism, which gets her fired from her job. And like all books
*  of this era ends with a scene of her in psychoanalysis.
