# The Jewish Left Is Trying to Hold Two Thoughts at Once
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBkGD01-Lxo)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  I don't really know how to start this.
*  Grief moves slowly and war moves quickly.
*  One person said after last week's audio essay, that to so quickly focus on the Israeli army's
*  response lacked a certain humanism.
*  And I understood and felt what they meant.
*  I also want to stay in the grief I have for the Israelis killed and the fear I have for
*  the hostages being held.
*  And I think there would have been wisdom, emotional and geopolitical, if Israel had
*  given itself time to grieve and time to plan before fully committing to a response.
*  But that's not what happened.
*  Israel dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza in just the first week.
*  It tightened the noose around the territory, keeping out food and water and medicine and
*  fuel.
*  A report I saw a few days ago said that Gaza is down to one week of insulin.
*  One week of insulin.
*  Less now.
*  My wife is a type 1 diabetic, dependent on insulin to stay alive.
*  A detail like that carries force for me.
*  What if it was my wife, the person I love most, who couldn't get insulin?
*  More than 5,000 Palestinians have been reported dead, many more injured.
*  There's a part of me that would like to stay in my feelings from right after Hamas' attack,
*  but that is not where this has held.
*  And the decisions being made now and that will be made soon will decide a lot of lives.
*  My approach to this topic is going to be to try to keep the boundaries of what can be
*  said and considered open.
*  To try to add context and to try to hear out a lot of different perspectives.
*  I said this last week, I'm not somebody who believes that I know how to solve this conflict.
*  I'm not somebody who believes this conflict can currently be solved.
*  I think we're at a much more primitive point in it right now.
*  But the building towards somewhere better, I think, requires a lot of different experiences
*  to be heard.
*  So I have plans for shows right now with people who are much further right than me on this.
*  I have plans that will center on Palestinian experiences and voices.
*  But I wanted to begin with a show closer to where I am, which is not a popular or easy
*  place to be at the moment, which is the Jewish left.
*  Many of us on the Jewish left on this felt abandoned and morally appalled at the comments
*  of people who had once been our allies immediately after.
*  What the left came to mean quickly in this conflict, the people who defined it, were
*  people who seemed to give no consideration to the lives of Israelis.
*  We do.
*  In many cases, the point of our involvement here is that we are attached in a deep way
*  to Israel.
*  Meanwhile, the force and ferocity of the Israeli response built.
*  And if you believe, as many of us believe, that there is no answer to this for Israel,
*  for anybody, until Israel can live in security while Palestinians do not live inside a regime
*  of oppression and humiliation and misery and terror, then amidst grief is a fear this is
*  only getting worse.
*  Palestinians mourn their dead and hate their killers just as much and fiercely as Israelis
*  do and the two sides somehow must live next to each other.
*  So what is the plan here?
*  There are ideas that float around and they've become, I think, scarier in recent years.
*  In 2017, Bezalel Smotrich wrote that, quote, any solution must be based on cutting off
*  the ambition to realize the Arab national hope between the Jordan and the Mediterranean.
*  The statement the Arab yearning for national expression in the land of Israel cannot be
*  repressed is incorrect.
*  Kino serves in Netanyahu's cabinet as Minister of Finance.
*  This is a kind of thinking that has been in power in recent years.
*  The thinking that says the repression has not been full enough.
*  It has brought us here.
*  But that does not mean it will weaken now.
*  It may well strengthen.
*  There are those who think a permanent occupation or an act of mass expulsion are the only true
*  answers in this conflict.
*  So I want to have a conversation with some other people coming from a similar perspective,
*  but with a lot more expertise on the core issues here than I have.
*  Spencer Ackerman is a national security reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner, author of the newsletter
*  Forever Wars, author of the great book on post 9-11 politics Reign of Terror.
*  Peter Beinart writes for New York Times Opinion.
*  He's a professor of journalism and political science at City University New York.
*  He's the editor at large of Jewish Currents and author of the substack The Beinart Notebook.
*  And they've both been writing pieces that I think are of deep relevance right now.
*  Spencer has been particularly following up on the symmetries to post 9-11 politics in
*  America and the way military planning happens in that kind of moment.
*  Beinart wrote a great piece thinking about the question before you can ever get to any
*  kind of settlement, you need groups in power on both sides that would want to see a settlement.
*  So if you want nonviolence to take hold, if you want other tactics to work, how are they
*  rewarded?
*  How do you think of feedback loops that can be created to give more power to those who
*  want to see something very different?
*  As always, my email is reclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Peter Beinart, Spencer Ackerman, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Thanks.
*  So Spencer, I want to begin here.
*  What is your sense now of what Hamas was trying to achieve in this attack?
*  So there have been some interesting reports that have come out this week that I think
*  clarify that question, but not in a satisfying way.
*  There was a report out of the Washington Post where a Hamas senior official, sort of on
*  the face of it, meaning to heighten a message of Israeli vulnerability, nevertheless said
*  that they didn't reckon that Israel would respond the way that Israel has, that they
*  thought they would take some hostages and negotiate them for the thousands of Palestinians
*  who were in Israeli military prisons and the status quo ante would prevail.
*  I think if it turns out that indeed Hamas was trying for a more limited sense of concrete
*  achievement for liberating prisoners, that has turned out to be just catastrophically
*  wrong.
*  I've seen some reporting similarly from Hamas on this and I found it truly bizarre.
*  I mean, this was in planning, in scale, a kind of attack Hamas had never launched before.
*  It's a land, sea and air attack.
*  It involves mass killing of Israeli civilians, some things they probably didn't know they
*  would stumble into, like the rave, which led to quite a bit of their body count.
*  So maybe their soldiers or whatever you want to call them took a kind of gruesome initiative
*  in that.
*  But they also spread videos of them killing Israelis on social media.
*  They've been on people's Facebook pages, almost gloating about their death.
*  There were a lot of hostages taken.
*  There are a lot of ways people characterize Hamas, but it would take a kind of genuine
*  madness and true irrationality to me for them to plan an attack of that scale and not believe
*  it would create an overwhelming Israeli response.
*  Now, there's been like a lot of commentary saying, well, they must have known they would
*  get this kind of response.
*  And so they wanted it.
*  They wanted to provoke Israel into this kind of attack.
*  They wanted to disrupt the accords with Saudi Arabia, something like that.
*  And those two narratives now seem in real tension.
*  So I'm curious how you think about that piece of it.
*  So one thing that struck me from the first wave of Hamas statements during the weekend
*  of the seventh after Sinhala Torah was that they didn't mention the Saudi deal.
*  I was writing a piece for the nation precisely about this when it happened and was looking
*  very closely to see the degree to which, if at all, Hamas would mention it and they didn't.
*  They were talking about more material facts closer to home rather than diplomatic facts
*  on the horizon from 30,000 feet above, the freeing of the prisoners, the loosening of
*  the Israeli strangulation of Gaza on down the line.
*  And again, I think there are ways after the fact, I've seen this a lot in the American
*  national security community over the last 12 days, that we often try and reason backward
*  from the actions that a given combatant like Hamas took and presume a greater strategy
*  there, presume that they must have known X, Y and Z would happen.
*  That often is not the way combatants in war operate from a planning stage to an execution
*  stage, from a strategic to an operational to a tactical level.
*  Should that be borne out by further reporting, probably speaks to the way that miscalculation
*  is an underappreciated factor in every wartime combatant.
*  This is something I've seen up close and personally.
*  The ambitions we have, the opportunities we see, the desires that we have when we give
*  into violence on an institutional level blind us, not just in the banal way to the humanity
*  of the people that come into our crosshairs, but to our own recognition of what reality
*  is and what's achievable here.
*  I hesitate to speculate or to put myself into a position of trying to read the minds of
*  Hamas.
*  All I can read are their statements and their actions.
*  And through them, remember all of the times that I have seen optimistic to the point of
*  irrationality statements from American, Israeli, all sorts of other combatants describing the
*  glorious ways their war will go and why it will lead to the achievement of all of these
*  grander objections that then go down in flames.
*  I would just add that although I don't know what Hamas expected, I do think it's important
*  to remember that Hamas does have a multi-decade long history of intentionally targeting and
*  killing civilians.
*  They did it during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s.
*  They did it during the 1990s during the Oslo process.
*  So I don't think anyone should have been surprised that Hamas members would kill civilians.
*  Maybe they hadn't had the opportunity to kill this many, but this is something that Hamas
*  has repeatedly shown that it's willing to do.
*  And let me then build on that because as you say, this has been the most horrific of Hamas's
*  attacks.
*  They've tried many things.
*  I think that everything has, from perspective of pure murder, worked as well as this.
*  What is your sense of how the attack has changed?
*  Let me put it this way, both the politics and the mass psychology in Israel?
*  I think that the agony that Israelis are going through is unfathomable, greater than what
*  Americans experienced after September 11th.
*  Greater just because as a share of the population, it was much higher.
*  Greater because of the deeper level of trauma that Israeli Jews and other Jews carry.
*  And greater because Al-Qaeda was far away from us.
*  I mean, they came to New York and they were mostly in other parts of the world.
*  Gaza and Hamas are on Israel's borders.
*  So that's, I think, the profound reality.
*  And I think there is coexisting with that a deep rage and anger at the Netanyahu government
*  that eventually will probably produce some kind of political earthquake.
*  But what kind of political earthquake?
*  We don't know.
*  And I think an absolute resolute belief among Jewish Israelis, and it's important to remember
*  that 20% of Israel's citizens are Palestinians, but among Jewish Israelis, I think overwhelming
*  consensus that Hamas must be destroyed.
*  Now when you actually try to ask what that means, things become a lot more cloudy and
*  I don't think people have good answers.
*  But that gut level emotional reaction seems nearly consensus.
*  I want to put a pin in that question of what it means to destroy Hamas.
*  But I want to get at something else in psychology.
*  One of the things that has been very present for me in some of the more upsetting commentary
*  right after Hamas's attacks, part of the commentary that couldn't imagine there being any such
*  thing as an Israeli civilian.
*  One thing I noticed in that is a kind of rigid categorization of power in a matchup between
*  Israel and Palestinians in Gaza.
*  Israel is by far the more powerful party and you can see that right now.
*  But you can understand Israeli psychology at all.
*  You can understand, I think, Jewish psychology at all without understanding the fear of genuine
*  eradication at the center of it.
*  How many times Jews have been powerless, how many times Israel has faced in living memory
*  of people who are in power there now, attacks that if they had gone another way, would have
*  wiped Israel off the map.
*  And so I wanted to get you to talk a bit about the way those two, both realities and psychologies
*  interplay, the sort of Israeli strength and Israeli, the genuine felt sense.
*  It is a small place surrounded by people who would try to wipe it out if they could.
*  There's no question that those things are buried very deep for many, many Jews.
*  And then for Israelis exacerbated by the traumas that have taken place in Israel, this happened
*  almost 50 years to the day of the Yom Kippur War, which was an extremely traumatic experience.
*  Many, many Israelis have people who have been lost.
*  And I totally agree with you.
*  One of the things that really disturbed me about some of the commentary on the left was
*  that there was a language of things like decolonization that erased the humanity of Israeli Jews.
*  And it reminded me of, you know, this is something George Orwell wrote a lot about, the way in
*  which certain kind of rhetorical formulations that people become very invested in then become
*  a way of covering over the human realities of what's actually being done in their name.
*  And I felt that way about some of the language of decolonization.
*  Well, this is just what decolonization looks like.
*  You know, if you have to break some eggs to make an omelet, so be it.
*  That is, to me, a kind of monstrous kind of thinking.
*  Very frightening.
*  I also think that this is fear that Israeli Jews has been fanned by a government that
*  has dehumanized Palestinians and made it harder for Israeli Jews to see Palestinians as ordinary
*  people who have ordinary human desires, who mostly just want to live and be able to raise
*  their kids in the same kinds of ways that we all want to do.
*  And I think because there has been so much dehumanization of Palestinians in Israel,
*  it has made it even more difficult to see Palestinians in any other way than through
*  as essentially the next group of people who threaten Jewish existence.
*  I want to ask you then about another side of this, which is how the attacks have changed
*  psychology for Jews living outside Israel and particularly those who have a very complicated
*  or critical relationship with Israel, which I think describes everybody at the table here.
*  There's the period running up to this where the right wing turn in Israeli politics, I
*  think, began to sever a lot of ties people had.
*  I mean, my relationship to Israel had changed quite a bit as the left began to collapse
*  there, as the peace process died, as Netanyahu and very, very, very far right extremist cabinet
*  ministers took and held power.
*  And there was also the attacks and the moment after them.
*  And then there was a, I saw online and in a lot of people, I knew a real rupture between
*  those same Jews, many of them who've worked for peace for a long time and what they were
*  seeing among people they often thought of as their allies.
*  And I've been watching a community I'm part of try to manage these two now very complicated
*  relationships.
*  And I'm curious how you've experienced that, how you've seen it.
*  I genuinely believe that at the heart of Judaism is the metaphor of family.
*  This is what makes it different than Christianity and Islam.
*  Genesis is the story mostly of a family and in the Exodus it becomes a nation and it's
*  imagined as a kind of extended family, B'nai Yisrael, the children of Israel, Israel being
*  the name that Isaac, that Jacob is given, sorry, after he wrestles with the angel.
*  So I believe that very, very deeply.
*  For me, this has awoken that in some really, really, really powerful ways.
*  And I struggle and it's very, very difficult to hold the sense of particular obligation,
*  particular special connection that I feel to Israeli Jews, like Jews all over the world
*  with the fact that I know that so many people in my community are weaponizing that and using
*  that in a way to lobotomize us so that we don't care about what happens to Palestinians.
*  And so we are okay with whatever is done to them because we care only about our own families.
*  And that logic can become horrifying in the days to come.
*  So I have never felt as much of a sense of struggle with my own community and with my
*  own love of a sense of community and trying to hold that and also be desperately afraid
*  of the way in which it's leading some people to act.
*  Let's talk then, Spencer, about what is actually being done.
*  How would you describe what Israel is doing in response, both what the tactics are, what
*  they have announced and shown themselves to be doing since Hamas's attack, and then what
*  the broader strategy is?
*  What have they articulated or what do they appear to be trying to achieve?
*  Tactically, what Israel is producing is collective punishment against 2.3 million Gazans intensifying
*  its strangulation of some of the most densely packed places on earth, calling it as it will.
*  I started seeing reports that Gaza is without painkillers, that doctors are operating on
*  wounded people of whom there are, I believe, more than 10,000 as of this recording without
*  anesthesia.
*  This is Israel's tactics against Gaza, not against Hamas, against Gaza.
*  I want to go to the question of what Israel says it is trying to achieve for a second
*  and how that matches up to what they're doing.
*  The main thing I have heard is that they're trying to destroy Hamas, eradicate Hamas.
*  I think a lot of people have heard this line from Yoav Golan, the defense minister, where
*  he says, we are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.
*  But I think if you just hear that line, you can interpret him as talking about Hamas.
*  What he says right before that is, I've ordered a full siege of the Gaza Strip.
*  No power, no food, no water, no gas.
*  Everything is closed.
*  And if you're just going after Hamas, not allowing food, not allowing water, though
*  they've turned some water back on, according to recent reporting, not allowing gas, that's
*  not a targeted anti-Hamas strategy.
*  That's a strangulation of the Gazan people.
*  Yes.
*  And let's just skip to the day after what Netanyahu describes as a long war.
*  Israel can deal severe blows to human beings and has an unquestioned capability to perhaps
*  kill members of Hamas and perhaps decapitate Hamas' leadership structure as well.
*  There will be something that comes after whatever Israel's operation is.
*  And as long as Israel keeps the conditions of strangulation on Gaza, there will be something
*  that comes after Hamas, whatever its form ends up taking.
*  And when we see Israel flattening buildings, taking these kinds of collective punishment
*  Then it looks to me less like a war against Hamas and more like a calling of Palestinians
*  in Gaza with Hamas as a proximate target.
*  One thing I have heard many people say now, and that includes many Palestinians, but it
*  also now includes some Israelis who have called for this openly, like a member of the Knesset,
*  is that what Israel really wants to do here is what gets called the second Nakba, a second
*  mass expulsion of Palestinians, creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees who don't
*  or cannot come back.
*  And one reason people believe that is that there are those in the Israeli government
*  who seem to want that before this.
*  And so the fear is that Hamas' atrocities become the excuse for something that the far
*  right in Israel could not have achieved before, but now it has a political and military space
*  to try to achieve.
*  So can you first say what a Nakba is, what that word means in this context, and then
*  whether you think that's a reasonable fear?
*  Yes.
*  So Nakba is the Arabic word for catastrophe, and it describes the experience in which more
*  than half of the Palestinian population was expelled or fled in fear during Israel's war
*  of independence between essentially 1947 and 1949.
*  But the point that Palestinians make again and again is that in a certain sense, the
*  Nakba never ended because there have been expulsions that have continued, drips and
*  drabs.
*  There was another large one in 1967.
*  In some ways, it wouldn't even be the second Nakba.
*  You could actually say it would be the third Nakba and smaller scale every year in between
*  in various ways.
*  Most of the people in Gaza, and I don't think this is sufficiently recognized in the mainstream
*  American press sometimes, are not from Gaza.
*  They are the children and grandchildren and some are original refugees who were forced
*  from what is now Israel.
*  And there is this profound collective trauma about the fact that this is happening again.
*  We know from what we've seen in the United States in recent years, the way that things
*  in the deep history of a country, if they're never dealt with, if they're never acknowledged,
*  if there's never a process of reparation and historical justice, they remain there waiting
*  for a moment of trauma to come back.
*  So when Israel said, leave the northern Gaza Strip and go to the southern Gaza Strip, many
*  Palestinians, especially elderly Palestinians, were saying, I will not leave because this
*  is happening again.
*  We know we will not be allowed to return.
*  This is a very, very real threat that exists at this moment.
*  And the American government needs to have as it's one of its central policy goals to
*  ensure that Joe Biden is not judged by history as American president who allowed yet another
*  knock about to take place on his watch.
*  I would add to that before this past weekend, a tremendous amount of effort from the secretary
*  of state, Anthony Blinken and the Biden administration was to create this, what they would call humanitarian
*  corridor that they suggested would be a way of getting Palestinians out of Gaza, into
*  Sinai from the onslaught that Israel plans to put on Gaza.
*  And they had to hear not just from Palestinians, who I'm not sure that they really properly
*  interacted with, but from the regional governments that that was, and this was Blinken's term,
*  a non-starter because everyone in the region, Palestinian and non-Palestinian, recognized
*  the historical reference point of the Nakba.
*  I talked on Sunday, right after this began happening, with a formerly Palestinian American
*  who now lives in Turkey named Samuel Aryan, someone whom the war on terror railroaded
*  out of this country.
*  And I asked him about the intensification that Gaza was about to experience.
*  We were talking in the context of a piece I was doing for the nation about the Americans'
*  efforts to put together a Saudi normalization with Israel in the context of the war.
*  And he said, what else can they do?
*  And I said, well, for instance, they could push you out of Gaza.
*  And he said, that's a fantasy, that's a fantasy of the right, we're not leaving.
*  And I can't stop thinking of these words that he said afterwards, which is that if we have
*  to die, we'll die in our homes.
*  But now a government that purports to speak for the safety and national aspirations of
*  Jews worldwide is inflicting upon another people.
*  I cannot think of a less Jewish thing than to make another person a refugee.
*  So recognizing Peter, this is a very hard question to put to anybody.
*  But something that I think people will think hearing this is, look, it's easy sitting in
*  New York to criticize.
*  But as you said very eloquently earlier, one way this is different than 9-11 is that Israel
*  and Gaza are about each other, the West Bank, that everybody is crammed in together.
*  And it's not just the West Bank, it's the whole world.
*  And it's not just the West Bank, it's the whole world.
*  So what would a moral response be?
*  And not just a moral response, but one that took seriously the Israeli people's need for
*  security?
*  And also, and I think this is not just a fair, but an important question of statecraft, that
*  it can't be costless to slaughter Israeli civilians and take Israeli hostages.
*  I mean, no country on earth would allow that.
*  So first of all, there has to be an effort to bring back these captives.
*  And although this has very, very little purchase, probably in Israel, I think if your number
*  one overriding goal is the safety of those people, Israel would need to consider some
*  kind of prisoner swap with Hamas, perhaps for elderly Palestinian prisoners who represent
*  no actual threat once they leave prison.
*  I agree that the people who masterminded this attack, the people who carried those attacks,
*  those people are war criminals.
*  They should be dealt with.
*  They should be brought to justice.
*  Beyond that, my fear is that Israel is going to go into Gaza on the ground looking for
*  security and safety.
*  And what it's ultimately going to get is less safety and less security than it has today.
*  Doesn't a mass prisoner swap for the hostages create the incentive for Hamas to do this
*  again and again?
*  I mean, as Spencer said earlier, consensus view is one thing Hamas wanted out of this,
*  was a bunch of Israeli civilian hostages because they have done prisoner swaps in the past.
*  And they saw that as a way to do another one here to give them what they wanted on that.
*  Doesn't that just create a reason for them to keep doing it, to make this a successful
*  strategy for them?
*  Absolutely.
*  That is a very real danger of that strategy.
*  But I also fear that what Israel is doing now is going to lead ultimately to Hamas being
*  stronger.
*  And I don't think that's because all those Palestinians who are supporting Hamas believe
*  in the killing of civilians.
*  Some do tragically, but many don't.
*  It's because they have seen no other form of resistance that has gotten them any of
*  Israel has been blockading Gaza for 17 years.
*  When the blockade began, Hamas's rockets were these very, very primitive things.
*  17 years later, their arsenal is much more formidable than it was.
*  And they were able to do this.
*  This is not a good trajectory to be on for the safety of Israelis.
*  Fundamentally, Palestinians are going to resist their oppression because all human beings
*  resist their oppression.
*  There's an interesting piece by Amjad Araki in the London Review of Books, and he writes,
*  Young Palestinians, many of whom were raised under the false promises of the Oslo Accords
*  signed 30 years ago last month, have been taking up arms and joining local militias
*  unaffiliated with the major political parties.
*  On the streets and online, Palestinian activists no longer care to tiptoe around diplomatic
*  language or references to international laws that have failed them.
*  I feel like it's something we've seen before that even if you imagine a world where Israel
*  is quite successful in smashing Hamas, that doesn't necessarily mean the world you get
*  is no extremist violent groups dedicated to killing Israelis.
*  That what you might get is a splintering into somewhat yet more extreme and dangerous groups
*  that have no political arm whatsoever, which Hamas is this weird kind of, it has a political
*  arm, it has a military arm.
*  You've watched this kind of thing happen before, so I'm curious what you make of it.
*  It reminds me a little bit of sort of the pre-ISIS conversation and the post-ISIS conversation.
*  And ISIS has been, you know, back here as a metaphor a lot, but as you mentioned in
*  peace, sort of not being used as a way you might think that metaphor would be used.
*  When the United States invaded Iraq, there was barely any al-Qaeda presence there.
*  That quickly changed and it became home to the most violent, nihilistic, and ambitious
*  affiliate of al-Qaeda.
*  And then when the United States in 2006, 7, 8 believed that it had dealt a fatal blow to
*  that organization, that along with the Syrian civil war next door combined to create an
*  enemy far greater, far more loathsome and terrifying than the one that the United States
*  went into Iraq to stop.
*  We have seen this again and again and again in conditions of occupation, apartheid, strangulation,
*  whereby as these conditions persist, they don't empower the levelist heads among us.
*  They create despair and despair will have a reaction.
*  Despair will emerge in ways that we who do not experience that despair will find barbaric,
*  probably correctly so in many cases, and more importantly won't anticipate.
*  Only when you deal at the root with addressing the fundamental conditions of that despair
*  can this dynamic change at all.
*  And to expect this to be an exception is to be blind to a history that we have seen unfold,
*  not just in our lifetimes, but across 75 years of Israeli history and American sponsorship.
*  People act as if this conflict began with Hamas.
*  Palestinians were fighting against Israel and Zionism, including by killing civilians,
*  for instance, in the hijackings of the 1970s, the 1972 Munich Olympics.
*  That was not Hamas.
*  Hamas didn't exist.
*  That wasn't Islamist.
*  Those were largely, a lot of them were leftist Palestinian organizations.
*  So anyone who thinks you are going to end Palestinian attacks on civilians,
*  even if you could get rid of Hamas, unless you deal with the root of the violence of oppression,
*  it seems to me is kidding themselves.
*  Something you often hear said is why isn't there a nonviolent Palestinian movement?
*  Why can't this be more like the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa?
*  Why can't it be more like the Gandhian independence movement in India?
*  And you wrote a great piece for the Times,
*  kind of thinking through particularly the South African comparison.
*  So how do you contrast that?
*  And what is your answer to why the path of violence has been
*  chosen and the path of nonviolence seems so now dormant?
*  Well, the African National Congress was not nonviolent.
*  In the early 1960s, they actually adopted armed struggle.
*  And yet they worked pretty hard to not go after civilians.
*  That was a moral red line, rightly.
*  And the argument that I made in my piece, of course, there are many,
*  many differences between these two situations, is to understand how the ANC was able to maintain
*  that moral code in which at one point they took responsibility and virtually apologized
*  after some of their cadres, their commandos had killed civilians,
*  was that their moral strategy was working.
*  They saw that by the 1980s, an anti-apartheid movement had emerged across the world,
*  including in the United States, led by the black community in the United States in particular,
*  that had gotten to impose sanctions that had led to divestment efforts.
*  And it produced a virtuous cycle that made it easier for them to maintain their moral core.
*  Now, Hamas has never had the same moral core that the ANC had, to be clear.
*  But there are many Palestinians who have spoken in the language of human rights
*  and international law and coexistence and opposed violence against civilians and called for boycotts
*  and called for sanctions and tried to go to the International Criminal Court and tried to go to
*  the United Nations. Tragically, in my view, unlike what we were able to do in America in the 1980s,
*  which was to strengthen and empower those people, those people have been shut down,
*  not just defeated, but often criminalized. I'm not saying that everyone needs to sign up to every
*  aspect of the boycott, divestment, sanction movement. But if there is no form of ethical
*  or nonviolent Palestinian resistance that you support, then you were just telling Palestinians
*  they should accept their oppression in silence, you are going to empower Hamas.
*  And not just accept their oppression in silence, disappear from the face of the earth.
*  Every single day, Palestinians experience violence. That was true before October 7th.
*  It is true certainly in the wake of it. What happened to a Palestinian nonviolent effort?
*  Well, part of it is Israel killed those people. Israel put their leaders in jail. I'm so old that
*  I remember, I guess back in the mid-2000s when people talked about the importance of releasing
*  Marwan Barghouti from prison on the idea that he was a way out of the PLO and Hamas in a different
*  way. Do you want to say who he is? A Palestinian leader who tried to forge a different path,
*  who emerged from conditions of violent resistance, but was trying to move toward a different form of
*  national struggle. And this also is an important point here. The United States as a matter of
*  policy suppressed that. The United States rejected Palestinian aspirations at the United Nations,
*  vetoed resolutions. Peter probably knows more than I do how many states in the United States
*  it is forbidden to have any involvement with boycott, divestment and sanctions,
*  where there are penalties for state interaction with those movements and those efforts.
*  More fundamentally, continued to fund and arm Israel and provided diplomatic support
*  while it suppressed legitimate Palestinian national aspirations. I find it a little
*  frustrating, certainly not as frustrating as a Palestinian would, but frustrating to hear from
*  people who have no intention of honoring and bringing about Palestinian national aspirations,
*  that they just don't do it the right way. The fact of the matter is people deserve freedom because
*  they are people. And that, I think, speaks to a reality that we as Americans tend not to acknowledge.
*  Peter Van Doren And my son Spencer is that in the same period, there's this very sharp break
*  around the role America is trying to play. Barack Obama didn't get a lot done here, but one thing he
*  did try to do, more so than any president since Carter, was challenge Israel on the settlements.
*  And I would say he had a showdown with Netanyahu on that and he lost.
*  Peter Van Doren Not only did he lose, I remember in 2010 when Joe Biden went as an envoy to secure
*  the first steps toward a return to the peace process, and Netanyahu's response was to announce
*  more settlement construction. Peter Van Doren A very direct snub. I mean, that was very, very
*  calculated. Peter Van Doren And it was hard not to think about that as Netanyahu and Biden embraced.
*  Forgive me for being the war on terror guy who constantly goes back to the war on terror,
*  but among the things that happened during that period was the war on terror, in which the position
*  of the United States, certainly beginning in September of 2001, was that Israel was fighting
*  in microcosm the circumstance that the United States was fighting. And accordingly, there was
*  no appetite to prompt Israel to return to any kind of negotiating posture when the prevailing view
*  in Washington, and certainly embraced by the Israelis because of how well it suited them,
*  was that the Palestinians were no different functionally from Al Qaeda. And that was a false
*  equivalence that many in American politics and media were not particularly inclined to question.
*  And as those conditions continued, Israel built its wall around the West Bank, which was a term
*  people policed very heavily, so as not to call it a wall. And I think it's very obvious that it was
*  and remains a wall that the United States reached the thing that we constantly talk about
*  in this day and age, not reaching which is normalization. Normalization of the persistent
*  immiseration of the Palestinian people, normalization of the sense that I think Peter
*  has discussed quite eloquently of, and Tarek Bacony cited as well, a certain equilibrium
*  that we saw on October 7th where it leads. That if you would simply find a way to ignore Palestinian
*  national aspirations and the basic facts of Palestinian material life, that the region would
*  simply move on, that Israel would find normalization from the Gulf States and eventually Saudi Arabia.
*  And whatever else it is that Hamas might have sought to achieve unrealistically through its
*  attacks beginning on October 7th, that equilibrium has indeed been shattered. And the United States,
*  were it to recognize itself as a central actor that it in fact is in this conflict,
*  would come to a deep reckoning of the way in which it enabled this circumstance to take root
*  and adjust course accordingly. I've been very struck watching Biden. A lot of what he has said
*  actually is opposed to things that have come out elsewhere in his administration, I felt has been
*  pretty on point. But the degree of immediate locking arms with Israel and Netanyahu, knowing
*  him a bit and knowing his history on these issues, knowing his fury after what happened with Netanyahu
*  in the Obama administration, I've wondered a little bit about his longer term play that something was
*  happening in Israeli American politics is that Israel is becoming right wing coded. It was
*  becoming something that Democrats had more complicated feelings on, Netanyahu had embraced
*  Trump very fulsomely. Joe Biden is a guy who likes to imagine himself like one of the great diplomatic
*  presidents of all time, as a Senate Foreign Relations chair, he likes doing his shuttle
*  diplomacy. And he seems to me to be trying to rebuild a role for America as a broker,
*  possibly at the cost of its capability of bringing together other players in the region,
*  but trying to rebuild its influence in Israel, hopefully with on his part, some end game.
*  But that has struck me as a possible way of reading
*  just a level of intense support and kind of political capital. He's invested in this
*  immediately. The people who form the highest echelons of the Biden administration were the
*  people who formed the second highest echelons of the Obama administration. And particularly
*  amongst his Middle East people, their takeaway from the experience is that Obama's instincts
*  throughout the Middle East failed and were a mess. That toward the end of the Obama administration,
*  after the Iran deal, there was a strain that I think it's fair to say the Biden administration
*  has run with is the centrality of its foreign policy toward the Middle East. And that is,
*  embrace the old autocrats as hard as you can, embrace the petro states as hard as you can,
*  recognize that nothing you will want to see accomplished in the rest of the world will
*  happen unless you unwind things like the way that Biden called Saudi Arabia a pariah state.
*  It took the better part of a year for that to unwind. And a central aspect of that experience
*  was seeing the ways in which efforts by Obama to impose the barest outlines of political
*  settlement for a two state solution on Israel came to nothing but tears, needless antagonism
*  and struggle and the acceleration of that, what you call right wing codedness. Biden wants none
*  of that smoke. Absolutely none of it. I think it is fair to question after October 7th, the degree
*  to which that strategy lies in ruins to simply look past as so much of the world had looked past
*  Israeli apartheid and the conditions of Palestinian deprivation and consider that a footnote to a
*  glorious history in which the United States has this seamless interoperable network. This is often
*  how they describe it from a security perspective in which it is the security guarantor of the
*  Middle East and relations in the region with a rising China remain commercial and transactional.
*  And that will secure the American position in the Middle East for generations to come. It doesn't
*  look like that's really working out. And we should also just say, we have not seen the end of the way
*  this war looks. Every day I wake up scared and checking the news feeds to see if a second front
*  has opened up in Southern Lebanon. That's a real possibility here. The United States has two aircraft
*  carrier strike groups quite possibly to assist in an assault should Hezbollah decide to enter the war
*  in force, at which point you really do have an expanded regional war that the United States is
*  indirectly. And I don't know if the United States has really thought through the degree to which it
*  itself is very close to being a combatant in this conflict. I'm curious what you read in what the
*  United States wants here. I think the most generous interpretation is that Biden believes that if he
*  hugs Netanyahu and he wins credibility among Israelis, he may have the leverage to behind the
*  scenes restrain what Israel does. So it's not totally apocalyptic. It doesn't spur the regional
*  war or the overthrow of the Jordanian regime or the overthrow of Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank,
*  that he can do that behind the scenes, that he kind of reasons that Obama didn't have credibility
*  in Israel, partly because of who he was, but partly because of public confrontation. So he's
*  going to do the opposite. But I think history will not be kind to the Biden administration's
*  way of approaching with this. They just didn't have any stomach for any political fight in
*  Washington to do anything for the Palestinians and essentially acted as if that could just be
*  managed as they go went off to fight their new cold war with China and then to deal with Russia.
*  They contributed to this feeling among Palestinians that they were being more and more marginalized,
*  that they were more and more hopeless. That contributed, that empowered Hamas to take this
*  action. So part of the problem is they have accepted a political reality in Washington
*  that essentially says you can't have a fight with Israel. But by accepting that political reality,
*  they have also strengthened that political reality. If a Democratic president had tried
*  to do something different, given what we see among polling shifts, among Democrats out there in our
*  country and actually lead, he could have potentially changed the politics. Instead, what Joe Biden has
*  done is he's essentially strengthened a kind of consensus in Washington that many grassroots
*  Democrats don't support. And by doing so, I think he contributed to this explosion.
*  But do you think it changes now? I mean, do you think there is something to the idea that if Biden
*  is able to win back credibility for sort of Democratic administration in Israel at a point
*  of weakness for Netanyahu, when the US government at this point was doing a lot of deals and working
*  with the Gulf States? I mean, the idea that the equilibrium, you can just forget about the
*  Palestinian problem has been shattered is true in America, too, right? That's true for the Biden
*  administration, too. I do not want to suggest that like all this ends in a happy ending. I basically
*  couldn't believe anything further from the truth. But I do wonder if there is not a opening here,
*  if things do not go too far off the rails in the immediate near term, to try to begin the work that
*  was being done before of, you know, are there not deals that can be made? Are there not people who
*  can be empowered? Is there not some legacy other than the continuing dissolution of this?
*  I think it would be very difficult with this Israeli government, given how radical it is.
*  And I fear that the Biden administration, if it manages to somehow avert a regional catastrophe,
*  will kind of go back and say, okay, things are now okay now. The best case scenario might be
*  in the short term that there is some Israeli election that produces some kind of political
*  earthquake. Now, that political earthquake could lead Israel even further to the right. We have no
*  idea really what it would mean. But things have been deeply destabilized. And in the best case
*  scenario, perhaps you might, especially because of the forces that were leading against this judicial
*  overhaul, that maybe there could be some new political leadership in Israel that Biden could
*  work with and do something that no American government and no Israeli government has ever
*  done, which is restrain settlement growth, for instance. We've never done that. Israel has never
*  done that, even during the peace process. That would be, I think, the best case scenario. It
*  wouldn't even bring us close to some kind of resolution, but it might at least create some
*  kind of hope for Palestinians that they're not just looking into despair as far as the eye can see.
*  One thing that was in the PC Road, Peter, is a kind of idea that I've been thinking about since then
*  of the tactics that generate a response, generate a kind of success, then empower the people behind
*  them. And you get into these cycles, right? Hardliners have a tendency to empower hardliners.
*  Hamas throws rockets at Israel and gets some concessions. Hamas kidnaps an Israeli soldier
*  and actually does get a prisoner swap. And that makes Hamas look stronger. Netanyahu's government
*  is able to kind of wall off the Palestinians and build an iron dome and fortify the wall. And
*  attacks are going down. And that makes them look stronger. Or similarly, there's an attack. And
*  now you need the hard right. You need the more military-oriented leaders, because of course,
*  you have to avenge the attack. And see, right, that in the case of South Africa,
*  that ethical resistance elicited international support, and international support made ethical
*  resistance easier to sustain. And in Israel today, the dynamic is almost exactly the opposite.
*  So I guess this raises this kind of deep question for me, which is I've long ago given up on the
*  idea that there is some kind of fantasy deal making to imagine here, right? Like that I can kind of in
*  my head imagine the land swaps and the right of return dynamics and all the things that would get
*  to a deal that I think the thing you're getting at in that piece, which is really quite powerful,
*  is that until there are different empowered actors, there can be no deal. Like you have to
*  change the political economy of the whole thing. You have to change who has strength.
*  And I'm curious how you think that gets done. We're so far away from it. But I do think that
*  one thing would be really important is 20% of Israel's citizens are Palestinians. They are a
*  really important group of people because although they're severely discriminated against, they're
*  the only Palestinians who actually have the ability to act politically, to vote. The problem
*  in Israeli politics, one major problem, is that there is no genuine joint Jewish and Palestinian
*  party. The parties are essentially all based on tribe, on various different kinds of tribes.
*  And so you don't have a party that even models the vision of the kind of politics that I would
*  ultimately like to see. And if there was, if that such a party could emerge and speak to Israelis
*  and Palestinians, because it would be composed of Israelis and Palestinians and say, the way we behave
*  in this party, coming together around a vision of humanity and equality under the law and liberal
*  democracy and fighting for it together as Jews and Palestinians inside Israel, I think that could
*  resonate around the whole world and show a model of what might be possible. We desperately need
*  models of what's possible now for people not to lose all hope.
*  I agree that it looks as far away as it's ever looked. But at the same time, I remember that
*  when the United States imposes conditions on its allies and foreign clients, quite a great deal of
*  it doesn't seem possible could in fact become possible. If the United States is, as the Biden
*  administration has done thus far, simply express solidarity with Israel, give it accelerated
*  ammunition shipments, then we won't have any of those incentives created. We won't have any
*  actors who could break this dynamic empowered. We won't have movements and constituencies for
*  Palestinian liberation taken seriously and sat across a negotiating table from Israel.
*  I don't pretend that my perspective holds much in the way of a constituency in Israel right now,
*  so I want to speak with some humbleness. But the thing is, what's possible is very often
*  different from what's necessary. And only when people of conscience hold true to what's necessary
*  can we start to expand the limits of what is possible until finally a way
*  pointing out of this horrific reality can come to pass. And that's something that
*  is not something that Israel would be granting Palestinians. It would be something Israel would
*  be performing for the survival of its own people, the people who we have, particularly
*  in the Jewish community in Israel and around the world, been agonizing over the fate of.
*  I want to make sure some of the competing Israeli narratives are felt here. And one of the very
*  dominant ones has been that there were efforts towards peace, there were many, many peace
*  processes. And obviously the narratives of what happened at places like Camp David and in this
*  or that negotiation are highly contested. I'm not going to try to untangle them here.
*  But it fundamentally to many Israelis didn't work. There wasn't enough of a negotiating partner.
*  Intifada's got launched. There were still rockets coming over. There were suicide bombings.
*  And then it seemed to me, and this was a very depressing thing to watch happen,
*  that a new consensus emerged. We're done with that. The far right in Israel is highly empowered.
*  We're going to cordon off Gaza, cordon off the West Bank, have a blockade on Gaza, build the
*  Iron Dome, build the wall, have intelligence operations, mow the lawn, by which it was a very
*  bloodless way of saying launch repeated attacks, try to degrade the capabilities of Hamas in
*  particular and other terrorist groups. And that within that, there are demands placed if this is
*  going to change on the Palestinians too. I mean, and particularly now that Israel has just suffered
*  this attack. And so I'm curious how you think about that side of it as well. And in particular,
*  what builds trust for Israelis? Right. And that's why I, like Spencer,
*  am so afraid of the idea of mass ethnic cleansing, because I think if you've written off the
*  possibility of giving people equality within the country in which they live, which is essentially
*  Israel, because they live under Israeli control in various ways, and you have given up on the idea
*  of partition and says that no longer possible. And you've given up on this idea of what the
*  Palestinian writer Tarek Bacone calls the kind of violent equilibrium in which you can manage this.
*  Then what are you left with? But the idea of trying to get those people out of there.
*  I would say, first of all, it is very important for Israeli Jews and people around the world to
*  know that there are Palestinians who have condemned these attacks, who have said that it is fundamentally
*  antithetical to them to take civilian life of any group. Iman Odeh, for instance, is just about
*  one of the most important Palestinian political leaders in Israel, has said that, unequivocally,
*  Adala, an organization of Palestinian Israelis, there have been people who have said that. I think
*  it's really important that we don't lose their voices in this. On the question of what happened
*  during all these negotiations, both Palestinians and Israeli Jews believe that the other side was
*  not acting in good faith. And if you really go through all of the details, I think what you come
*  to view at the end of the day is that they had two different conceptions of what this partition
*  would look like. They could never be bridged. But since Netanyahu came back to power in 2009,
*  we have not had an Israeli government that has been interested in a Palestinian state on any terms.
*  Even if you say that Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas deserve blame for what happened in 2000,
*  2001, 2007, 2008, and I think there is blame to go around, the problem with blaming the Palestinians
*  since 2009 is there has been no Israeli partner to even test their willingness to accept the idea of
*  a Palestinian state near the 1967 lines in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. So let me begin to bring
*  this to a close and not with sort of imaginings of a deal that isn't going to happen, but with a
*  sort of more direct question, which is, I agree with your point, Peter, that with this Israeli
*  government, it's very hard to imagine that kind of change. Who are figures, political leaders,
*  thinkers, people with a constituency of some sort on both sides of the conflict, who you all have
*  seen, heard from, and are the kind of people you wish would begin to hold more power? Are there
*  people who are for you, folks charting a pathway forward that has some glimmers of something
*  different? I think Ayman Oda is someone who does not command a substantial constituency in Israel,
*  and we shouldn't underestimate the left's nearly 20-year marginalization in Israel. But as Peter
*  pointed out earlier, is someone whose politics represents something outside of the zero-sum
*  nature of what Israeli politics and that we're seeing with the Netanyahu government
*  represents. And like Peter says, we don't know the direction of a government that may take shape
*  in response to fury at Netanyahu that Israelis have expressed for the last
*  nearly two weeks over this. But that fury is not necessarily a left-wing fury. That fury very often
*  has to do with the ways in which Netanyahu's gamble did not yield security. And the question is going
*  to be what Israelis take away from that lesson. Was the failure in security simply a failure of
*  sufficiently militarizing Israel toward the south and away from the West Bank? Or was it a more
*  fundamental failure in which the policy of keeping Hamas strong and funded in order to never have to
*  divest Israel of the West Bank was the fundamental failure here? Peter, do you have any other people
*  who spring to mind in that? Yes, I think I mentioned in passing this group, which is in English,
*  called Standing Together, led by Saleh Abed and Lonely Green and many others. It's an organization
*  of Israeli and Palestinian citizens who under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances,
*  especially now where they're literally facing state repression, have tried to offer a vision
*  of Israeli Jews and Palestinians standing together for mutual safety, mutual equality,
*  and coexistence. And those people give me hope. Are there any politicians in Israel that you
*  find? And here I mean actually Jewish politicians. The collapse of the Israeli left has been so
*  stark from when I started being involved in this issue in my 20s or in my teens. Does anybody feel
*  to you like they have any hope of reviving something? The problem is in this, I think,
*  in this idea of the Jewish left. We would not talk in the United States about the white left or the
*  Christian left. Inherent in being in the left is you don't stand for tribe. And the problem in
*  Israeli politics is there is not a robust politics that essentially sees itself as neither Jewish nor
*  Palestinian. There is a Jewish member of the Knesset in the Hadash party, which is a mostly
*  Palestinian party. That man, Ofer Kasif, was just basically banned from the Knesset for 45 days
*  for public statements he made, just to give you a sense of how difficult it is to occupy that.
*  But those are the people that I look to. And then always our final question. What are a few books
*  you'd recommend to the audience? And Spencer, why don't I start with you? Sure. So three books,
*  and I appreciate the question, Ezra. First, I would recommend reading The Hundred Years War on
*  Palestine by the historian Rashid Khalidi. That is a Palestinian, a very accessible Palestinian
*  history as Preci to the conflict beginning in the, you know, beginning of the 20th century to the
*  early 21st. A shattering book that people really ought to read is The Oral History of the Palestinian
*  Nakba that's edited by Nahla Abdo and Noor Massalha. Reading the history from the people who
*  experienced the Nakba around 1948 and periods both before and after is for those who know
*  Jewish history shattering in its familiarity and reading as well the accounts of people
*  who survived the Nakba, who talk about how these were their neighbors, people that they loved,
*  their children played with, who they had all sorts of social relationships with for a long
*  period of time. Turn on them and force them away is a shattering thing to remember and to hear.
*  And then finally, I would recommend Benny Morris and my former Guardian colleague,
*  Ian Black's book, Israel's Secret Wars, which is a history of the rise of the Israeli intelligence
*  services and their role in statecraft in Israel. Also has some simply incredible stories that are
*  amazing to believe are true. Peter? Because this has been a conversation among Jews,
*  and I know you're going to have Palestinian guests, I'm going to mention three books by
*  Palestinians, not because there are not so many books by Israeli Jews that I love, but just because
*  since Palestinians have often had, as Edward Said said, this not had this permission to narrate,
*  I think it's really important in this moment that their voices be elevated. The first is Edward
*  Said's kind of classic book, The Question of Palestine in 1979, which really lays out the
*  Palestinian experience. And what I love about that book and find so moving about it is it's a very,
*  very profound critique of Zionism. And yet Said is such a humanist that he's also able to describe
*  in that book to understand why Zionism was so appealing to so many Jews and why many Jews found
*  it liberating, even as he found it to be oppressive and Palestinians did. The second is Roger Shahada's
*  memoir, Strangers in the House. Spencer mentioned the Nakba. This is the story of growing up in a
*  family of people who were expelled. And it gives you a kind of an intimate glimpse into that
*  refugee experience, which is so central to the Palestinian experience. And yet I feel like
*  so often is missing from the American discourse about Israel-Palestine. And the third is,
*  we've mentioned Tarek Bacony before, Tarek Bacony's book Hamas Contained. It's a book about Hamas,
*  which has no illusions, which is very, very critical in parts, but describes the history of Hamas as a
*  political organization, that one can understand certain decisions it's made in response to certain
*  incentives. And if there is to be a better future for Israelis and Palestinians than the one that
*  Hamas envisions, part of that will require understanding Hamas better so that Jews and
*  Palestinians together can create better alternatives.
*  Spencer Ackman, Peter Beinart, thank you very much.
