# How China Went From Economic Superstar to Faltering Giant
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trTI8NNqe10)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So I think it's hard to overstate how dramatically the narrative on China swung in the past couple
*  of years. You go back to 2020 and 2021, and honestly even before that, and I've said this
*  before, the dominant emotion in the American political dialogue about China is envy. And
*  that is most true among the people who are counted as most anti-China. Take Donald Trump.
*  He would go on and on about how China was winning, how it was beating us at everything.
*  But this was pretty broad and it was based on something real. Its manufacturing prowess
*  had become stellar. It had gone from making very simple things to very complex things,
*  things that we no longer were able to reliably make. It was embarking on big ambitious projects
*  like Made in China 2025 and the Belt and Road Initiative. It had weathered the pandemic without
*  the mass death we saw in the West. It was able to build infrastructure and housing and transit
*  at speeds unimaginable to us now here. And what Trump said, Biden, you know, he's put into
*  practice. It isn't just that he kept things like the Trump tariffs. It's that if you look at the
*  Biden administration's economic policy, a lot of it is about rebuilding our capacity to compete
*  with China on what it can already make. Things like solar panels. And a lot more of it is about
*  trying to make sure we stay ahead of China on the technologies where we can make them now and they
*  cannot. And so that was the status quo, let's call it six months ago, eight months ago.
*  And then came the rest of 2022 and early 2023. And this entire story is flipped. China's property
*  sector melted down. Its zero COVID policy strangled the economy and led to nationwide protests.
*  Foreign investors were getting cold feet. China had allied itself tightly with Russia. Xi Jinping
*  was consolidating power in a way that worried basically, I think, everybody. Economic growth
*  was slowing. Thing after thing after thing was coming home there to roost in a way that made a
*  lot of people feel like the long time predictions of why an autocracy like China cannot sustain the
*  kind of growth and competence it had had until then were all coming true. China went from being
*  viewed as this model worth emulating to something of a disaster story, at least a cautionary tale.
*  You all know, because I've said it a bunch of times now, that I think trying to stay
*  abreast and trying to understand China is about the most important political question of the age.
*  And for those of us trying, one of the things you anticipate every year is this letter that Dan
*  Wong writes. And Dan Wong, he's a technology analyst at Gavical Dragonomics who've been in
*  China for these years. He's a visiting scholar now at the Yale Law School Psi Center. And one of the
*  things he does in these letters is he's able to weave together a sense of China's technological
*  capabilities, what they are making and how they are making it and what capacities they are building
*  through that process and its culture and its geographic differences in these really interesting
*  ways to give a felt sense of what it is like to have been there. That's hard to get from the
*  outside. And in 2019 and 2020 and 2021, it was really hard to read those letters without feeling
*  envy for what China was building and what being in China then was like. And then in the most recent
*  letter, things took this very sharp turn. So I wanted to have Wong on the show to talk about
*  what it has been like in China over this period, and particularly to talk about what's become
*  the core vector of competition between the two countries, which is technology and how we make
*  it and how we create it. As always, my email, Ezra Klein-Shoe at nytimes.com.
*  Dan Wong, welcome to the show. Ezra, thanks for having me on.
*  So I read your 2020 letter from China, your 2021 letter from China, and I read them as really the
*  most convincing cases I'd seen for what China was getting right, at least up until that point.
*  So let's rewind the clock a year or two. You're living there, you're a technology analyst there.
*  What was your read of China prior to 2022? To set the stage a little bit, I think 2020 and 2021
*  were quite good years to be in China, as you pointed out, Ezra, that in the very early stages
*  of the pandemic, it was actually quite a fun time to be in China, in part because the government
*  controlled the virus in a really good way. Now, I've been living in China since 2017.
*  For the last three years, I've more or less been stuck in China due to zero COVID. And over 2020,
*  I saw this enormous effort that the Chinese government made to control the spread of the
*  virus when it was more or less out of control everywhere else. Everywhere else outside of East
*  Asia, there were a lot of people getting infected and also a lot of people dying. And so I think
*  2020 and 2021 were quite nice times to be in China. Seemed like quite a lot of things were going right,
*  not just with a pandemic control, but also with various economic, political management issues that
*  the Beijing government was really trying to pull off. So you'd align in your 2020 letter that I
*  think captures as well, where you wrote, This year made me believe that China is the country with the
*  most can-do spirit in the world. Every segment of society mobilized to contain the pandemic.
*  One manufacturer expressed astonishment to me at how slowly Western counterparts moved. US companies
*  had to ask whether making masks aligned with the company's core competence. Chinese companies
*  simply decided that making money is their core competence and therefore they should be making
*  masks. So tell me a bit about that. That was a strange moment of global reversal. We had this
*  virus that came out of China. There's obviously questions about where it came from, but hold those
*  to the side for a second. But pretty quickly, it seems China has not just internally a very strong
*  response, but they become sort of the world's manufacturing shop for what other countries need
*  to respond. And they're able to do that very, very quickly. So tell me a bit about your sense of both
*  the competencies that revealed at that time and also what that did for China's sense of itself
*  and its role on the world stage. Yeah, one of the most important points I'd always like to make is
*  that Chinese are really good at making money. And, you know, they are always going to be
*  looking for opportunities to figure out whether they can make a buck here, make a buck there. And
*  in the early months of COVID, the Chinese manufacturers were thinking, well, you know,
*  this is actually a really good time to try to make masks, try to make things like rubbing alcohol,
*  and every other sort of personal protective equipment. And we had all of these pretty
*  funny headlines, I thought, of companies like BYD is actually China's largest electric vehicle maker,
*  also makes quite a lot of batteries. And in 2020, one of the major lines was that BYD was getting
*  into the business of making masks simply because it was a nice, profitable thing to do. And so one of
*  the things that I felt quite strongly in 2020, as you said, is that China has very much a can-do spirit,
*  that there was this very good embrace between a highly competent government that rallied quite a
*  lot to control the spread of the virus with some of the world's best business people, and embrace a
*  marriage that has been in place, I would say, for the last few centuries, where you have a lot of
*  mandarins who are supposedly very well trained in poetry and classical Chinese, locked in a
*  very fertile embrace with some of the world's best business people. And here is where you had
*  an instance of a strong state working very well together with strong entrepreneurs to tackle a
*  big problem in 2020. But one thing that then happens alongside this is that the Chinese
*  government feeling some strength, feeling that it is exhibiting competence, it has the support of the
*  people, becomes in important ways more assertive at home. And one thing that was a major focus of
*  your analysis in 2021 was the set of regulatory crackdowns Beijing launched in that summer,
*  particularly around tech companies and even full sectors of the technology industry.
*  And in America, if you're reading the coverage, because we have a certain attitude towards the
*  government heavily regulating companies, this was taken as authoritarianism, kind of a crackdown.
*  But you at least then had a more contrarian theory of what those crackdowns were meant to be,
*  an idea of how the Chinese government was trying to guide Chinese society and economic growth.
*  Tell me what they were and how you saw them then.
*  Yeah, well, the first thing to note is that I have absolutely no disagreement with the portrayal that
*  China's actions were highly authoritarian, that the Chinese government more or less decapitated
*  the online education sector, made it much more difficult for entire sectors to function like the
*  video game industry. It has more or less driven cryptocurrency mining out of the country, that
*  there are still some cryptocurrency activity in China, but at least a lot of the mining was gone.
*  And it punished particular companies, especially Ant Financial was the big one in 2021,
*  as well as Didi for various transgressions against either law or against various political
*  objectives. So there is no doubt that what the Chinese government did is highly authoritarian,
*  that it acts with this brutality and ferocity that everyone would be completely unused to in the West.
*  And I think you're right that I was thinking about a particular vision by the Communist Party that
*  it was trying to achieve with respect to cracking down on various private initiatives of which
*  the tech companies, the tech platforms were the biggest victim. And in particular, what I thought
*  was going on in 2021 was that the Chinese Communist Party has decided that they don't very much like
*  capitalism with American characteristics. Or maybe you can say this is just some variant of
*  Anglo-Saxon capitalism, that they were much more skeptical of a mode of growth in which over the
*  last 20 years, let's say that in the US growth has been driven very significantly by Silicon Valley
*  on the one coast, represented by consumer internet, as well as software businesses,
*  and by Wall Street on the other coast, represented by, let's say, a lot of financial initiatives.
*  And I think the Communist Party has taken the look at where that has gotten the US over the
*  last 20 years. And you can also say, again, rope in the UK here, which is a lot of their growth has
*  been driven by the city in London, represented by the financial industry. And the party has said,
*  well, there are different types of capitalisms that we'd like to pursue. And that it has looked
*  a little bit closer at, I would say, something like German industrialization and said, we would
*  quite like to be a little bit more like Germany. And Germany, I think, in their view, is going to be
*  represented by something like a lot of medium-large manufacturing firms that are really,
*  really good at pursuing some sort of niche technology in which they are totally world
*  dominant that is embedded in a very well-regulated market system where you have a very large
*  manufacturing workforce. That in Germany, the manufacturing share of GDP has steadily declined
*  over the last few decades, but not as drastically as in the US or the UK, where manufacturing,
*  last I checked in the US, is about 10% of the value added share of GDP in the economy.
*  And so I think the Chinese government is much more keen to say that, well, a lot of these
*  physics PhDs really ought to be doing something like physics rather than going to work for a hedge
*  fund. And they are, to some extent, closing off these exciting, dazzling, glamorous opportunities
*  in consumer internet or in finance and really trying to encourage the country's best and
*  brightest to go work in something like semiconductors or meteorology or chemical engineering instead.
*  So this was a view that the Chinese government had a point of view on what kind of technological
*  growth it wanted. And it connects to something that's in your writing, which is that maybe the
*  most important resource in an advanced economy is talent. And there is a public interest in where
*  talent goes. You have a line in an older essay where you say that you wish in America it hadn't
*  become a joke that you would go into plastics. And instead, young, ambitious graduates wanted to go
*  to Goldman Sachs or Facebook, that you should really want to go into plastics, that there should be
*  social value excitement around advanced materials manufacturing, say. And that in your view, that was
*  what China was trying to create. So tell me a bit about that idea of the flow of talent and both the
*  critique you were making of the US and what you thought was happening in Beijing.
*  Yeah. Well, it is, I think, a bit of a shame that plastics became a punchline. And the movie that
*  I'm referencing is something called The Graduate, which was released when the manufacturing workforce
*  in the US was still really substantial. But somehow that the word plastics became a punchline even then
*  when a fresh college grad represented by Dustin Hoffman was considering where to go next. And I
*  think of talent, as you say, as probably the most important thing there can be in an economy.
*  That the economy really is simply made up of people and the knowledge that they have, and that
*  we are able to think of our industrial civilization as something represented by big buildings,
*  big bridges, big train tracks, at least in Asia. I'm not sure if the US has really good train
*  tracks anymore, but as all these artifacts of an industrial civilization. And I think what we should
*  do is to refocus our attention much more on the knowledge in people's heads rather than in these
*  artifacts of technology that we have been able to create. He wrote then that the Chinese state has
*  long placed greater value on resilience over efficiency, which has dragged down its performance
*  on metrics that economists care about, like return on equity. And that in your view, that is as often
*  an indictment of the economic profession. Tell me in this context we're talking about, about this
*  tension between resilience and efficiency. So one of the big successes I think that China has had
*  over the last 25 years is to employ a lot of people and get them to build a lot of the basics
*  of an industrial civilization. That over the last 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic,
*  when China was a broken country where a lot of things had already been torn up, either by the
*  Japanese invasion or by the enormous civil war afterwards, that they didn't really start with
*  much. And they still didn't really start with much up until the 1980s at the start of reform and
*  opening. And one of the things that is pretty important to appreciate about the Chinese economy
*  is that every year they've had a lot of expansions in the workforce all the way up until about 2015
*  when the workforce started to shrink, that they needed to employ a lot of people and give them
*  stuff to do. And the Chinese government has therefore been much more focused on just creating
*  goods, building cities, building bridges, building roads, even if a lot of these roads go to nowhere,
*  even if a lot of these cities were empty at the beginning, simply to have a lot of the
*  basics of an industrial civilization in place. And so one of the problems that this creates
*  are things like lower returns on profits, lower returns on equity, that one of China's major
*  problems has been significant over capacity in all of these things that I mentioned. And that is
*  one of the most significant pathologies that has animated the Chinese Communist Party, which they
*  build first and then ask questions later. So it's one way of thinking about this difference
*  to go back to an Obama era program, this loan program that backed Solyndra, which was kind of
*  a disaster in terms of returns on equity and embarrassed people in the Obama administration.
*  But also backed and through a lifeline at that time to Tesla, which was a small struggling
*  electric car company is now obviously a behemoth. I would say it's fair to say that here, the
*  incentives of government are such that they are so afraid of Solyndra's, they would prefer to not
*  have them at the cost of not supporting a Tesla. And what you're saying is that the trade-off in
*  China is the opposite, that they are willing to accept many, many, many, many Solyndras.
*  If that means they get some Teslas.
*  Yes, that's right. I think that the Chinese, again, I would call this a pathology is to
*  just try things out and to build. And even if a lot of these investments really don't work out
*  and drag on returns on equity, that they really like it if a Tesla emerges out of a bad program.
*  Now, I really like the example you bring up of Solyndra, because Solyndra was a failure
*  was a failed solar startup. And one of what I think is the most emblematic successes of Chinese
*  industrial policy is in the solar industry. And I think the solar industry is absolutely fascinating
*  for many reasons. But in the context of what you're thinking about, Ezra, I think that the
*  important thing to mention about solar is that China just went all in on trying to figure out
*  solar and more or less succeeded. But its success has been much more of a public policy success
*  than a success for investors, which again is something that hurts return on equity.
*  So when I think about the solar industry, I think about most of all, a decision taken by the State
*  Council, which is the executive agency of the central government in Beijing, to declare solar
*  a strategic emerging industry, an SEI in 2010. What happened after the Chinese government
*  designated solar to be a super important industry was that the subsidies were enormous, and they
*  flowed in, that the Chinese government subsidized a lot of the aspects of solar production, as well
*  as consumption, that made a lot of different entrepreneurs who previously knew absolutely
*  nothing about solar to jump in because there were so many subsidies out there. And I think what you
*  see basically in 2023 is that the solar industry has broadly been a major public policy success
*  in China, that China controls about 80% of the value chain in solar, everything from the tooling
*  and the materials to produce solar photovoltaics, as well as the actual production of the modules
*  and cells. It is an industry absolutely dominated by Chinese companies, and so that is good for the
*  Chinese government from a not just a pride perspective, but also from a strategic perspective.
*  I think that has been good for the climate movement, where the breathtaking drops in solar costs has
*  fallen something like 97% over the last few decades. So that has also been really good for consumers.
*  And one thing that has not been all that good for has been the capitalists, which are both
*  running the solar facilities that are actually selling the solar panels, as well as their investors.
*  Because something that the Chinese government did was that it induced so many companies to jump into
*  the space, companies that are mostly making commoditized products, that there is not huge
*  difference between all of these different solar photovoltaic makers to jump in here and start
*  competing with each other to make what is a pretty commoditized product where no one is making a lot
*  of profits. And so this is a Chinese industrial policy success, but this is very much a success
*  with Chinese characteristics in which investors and corporates don't make that much money,
*  but the government and the consumers can be pretty happy. And to flip that analysis, it is certainly
*  now being treated as an American policy failure. That if you look at the Inflation Reduction Act,
*  I talked to the Biden administration about this exact question a number of times now.
*  They are on the one hand, all of their climate goals require an incredibly rapid buildup in
*  solar energy and solar deployment. And on the other hand, they don't want our entire energy
*  infrastructure to be dependent on Chinese manufacturing. And so they are trying on the
*  one hand to accelerate solar and on the other hand to onshore the solar manufacturing chain.
*  And something you've pointed out in the past is that this is a little bit of a weird position
*  for us to be in because not only America, but substantially America made a lot of the major
*  technological discoveries in solar. And we, along with Germany and others, did a lot of the subsidies
*  in recent years to encourage the purchasing of solar. And yet we lost the entire manufacturing
*  chain of something that we substantially invented. And this goes to a point of a Foreign
*  Affairs article you wrote not long ago about the ways in which we miss how China has out-competed
*  us on certain dimensions, but also has moved up the value chain, has actually developed kinds of
*  knowledge that we thought were not that valuable, but that turned out to be incredibly valuable.
*  Now we are desperate to restore. So do you want to talk about that a little bit from the perspective
*  of the American policy failure? Sure. So I think that it hasn't been for a lack of trying that
*  American policy hasn't nurtured enough of a solar industry. That I think it was under President
*  Obama in around 2012 that the US government had already recognized that Chinese were making
*  very efficient solar panels and that President Obama decided to impose tariffs, tariffs that
*  ultimately President Trump also extended again in something like 2017. There have been several
*  rounds of allegations by the US government that the solar supply chain, namely polysilicon
*  production, implicates forced labor in the Xinjiang region where a lot of Uighurs are in
*  detention camps, in part that these detention camps are possibly helping with the production
*  of polysilicon, which is a charge that Beijing denies. But the US government has levied various
*  regulatory instruments, something that includes tariffs, which is a traditional instrument,
*  as well as these blocking orders that make it much more difficult for Chinese companies to sell solar
*  to the US without a lot of documentation trying to prove that they don't have forced labor,
*  that the US government has imposed a lot of these novel regulatory instruments really to try to
*  constrain China's growth in the manufacture of solar PV. And for the most part, I think that has
*  made not a dent in China's ability to actually maintain its dominance in solar. And so solar,
*  I think, is emblematic of Chinese success, not only because it demonstrates that the Chinese
*  government is much more interested in the interests of consumers, as well as strategic advantage and
*  less interested in whether investors are able to make a profit in these new technologies. It is also
*  an example where China was able to more or less piggyback off of the successes made by the US,
*  as well as Germany, in investing a great deal in a lot of the basic science in creating this industry.
*  A lot of the science R&D, a lot of the basic research in solar technologies was made by the
*  US government, as well as in Europe, to establish the basic scalability of the solar PVs. And what
*  happened was that China, after waiting, I think not totally intentionally, but was in a good moment
*  to wait for the science to be mature and then focus on scaling. And so it built a lot of the
*  manufacturing capabilities. China doesn't have still a really excellent world-class scientific
*  capabilities yet, but China does have world-class manufacturing capabilities. It waited until a lot
*  of the science was mature and then just focused on scaling up the technology. And so I think solar is
*  emblematic of China's ability to focus much more on using manufacturing to just outcompete the US
*  after the science is mature. And I fear that it is going to happen in different industries if the US
*  doesn't think much more about building out the labor force to have a very good manufacturing
*  ecosystem to be able to scale up the next solar technology.
*  So many of the strengths we're talking about here for China remain so today, but I've kept us in your
*  analyses in 2020 and 2021 because they capture China at a certain point of time when their strengths
*  become very, very visible. And there is a tendency to extrapolate out from the past that China is
*  a very, very different tone. And I think that tone tracks a broader shift in the narrative
*  and estimations of what China is and where it's going. So tell me about what changed in 2022.
*  Tell me about how your view in 2022 was different by the end of it than your view had been at the
*  end of 2021. Yes, absolutely. So I think the starting point for thinking about China in 2022
*  has to be three major events. The first was that the enforcement of zero COVID went a little bit
*  too far and immiserated a lot of people in China due to lockdowns until they were completely and
*  abruptly abandoned in December, which I also lived through. The second big event to do with China has
*  to be the greater centralization of power under top leader Xi Jinping in the aftermath of the 20th
*  Party Congress in October, when Xi Jinping more or less routed any sense that he had an opposition
*  within the party, that this validated his tenure for a third term as general secretary of the Chinese
*  Communist Party. And I think more or less makes it very likely that he will have a fourth term
*  once this is up so that this more or less guarantees that he will have about 20 years to be the top
*  leader in China. And then the third most important thing to happen in China was a declaration in
*  February, about three weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, that Beijing had a limitless friendship
*  with Russia, which knows no forbidden zones. And so this really embraced an imperial power right
*  before that imperial power launched a major war in Europe. And so I think this has to be the
*  starting point of what we're thinking about in 2022. And my lens here is that this shows very
*  much that the Communist Party has been interested in growth for a very long time, that it remains
*  still fairly interested in economic growth, that it retains quite a lot of economic pragmatism.
*  But I think one of the things that we really have to adjust is to think of this country as a little
*  bit less of a technocracy that slips occasionally into Marxist doctrine and Marxist faults,
*  and that this has to be viewed on balance much more as an autocracy that is occasionally interested
*  in economic pragmatism, but which is an autocracy that is much more committed to these ideological
*  goals where growth is important, but it is a more of a secondary concern. One of to me the profound
*  lessons of life, of getting older, is recognizing myself and other people that whatever our strengths
*  are, that's also where you're going to find our most terrible weaknesses. And this is true,
*  I think, for countries too. And something I appreciate about your analysis here is that
*  the 2022 look is really about the same dynamics of China as the 2021 and 2020 letters, but it's about
*  how they can turn. And you're right, what I did not sufficiently appreciate is that a government
*  that would so casually decapitate the online education sector would also have the will to
*  visit catastrophe upon whole cities. So tell me a bit about that. We didn't talk exactly about what
*  they did in the online education sector, so maybe you can say that quickly, but tell me about how you
*  understand that state as having unleashed itself, moved from having the power to maybe make decisions
*  the American government wouldn't make to making decisions that the American government should never
*  make. The Communist Party imposed, I think it's not unfair to say, communism on the online education
*  sector, declaring that online education platforms cannot make profit in China. And so that along
*  with the bundle of tech regulations we were talking about earlier, so things like video game
*  regulation, cryptocurrency regulation was part of the bundle of the moves in 2021 that I thought
*  that this is a signal that they are much more interested in being more like Germany than being
*  like the United States. I think this demonstrates that China has a problem sometimes of too much
*  state capacity, that it is utterly possible to fail when one succeeds. And so that the Chinese
*  government is able to do a little bit too much. So in 2020 and 2021, this was a broadly successful
*  strategy of keeping debts low in China due to COVID because it was able to block transmission
*  of everything up until the Delta variant. But it is able to take these things a little bit too far
*  and impose whole lockdowns on places like Shanghai, where for about two months, 25 million people were
*  not really able to step outside of their apartment doorways or at best travel outside their apartment
*  compounds, which is made up of kind of a garden that a lot of people are able to walk through.
*  And so I think that these moves demonstrate that China's problem is sometimes to just have a little
*  bit too much state capacity, a little bit too much of an engineering mindset to control various
*  problems. Sometimes that's good. And I'm sure you're familiar with this term, Ezra, of supply-side
*  progressivism. I've heard of it, yes. Where China is a very good supply-side economy, where it is
*  just really intent on building a lot and doing a lot. But I think the flip side of this term,
*  where it is not so progressive anymore, is that it is just a little bit too intent to control
*  too many things that perhaps it is just really not a successful strategy to continue pursuing.
*  You keep saying here a little bit too much, but I found the letter, the description,
*  which mirrors other reports from this period, pretty chilling. I mean, huge cities were put
*  into extended lockdown. People died because they couldn't get medical care. You talk about
*  food becoming the obsession of almost everybody and people going without food so their children
*  can eat because the logistics chains couldn't handle feeding that many people when people
*  couldn't go out and purchase food. I mean, I think it's certainly connect this to the detention and
*  surveillance of the Uyghurs and possibly to the surveillance state being built all across
*  China on top of very advanced technologies like AI. So I think the other side of looking at this
*  is that it's not potentially an excess. It's that the danger of having a state this powerful
*  is that eventually somebody is going to want to use it. And the tendency, the seductiveness
*  of being able to control society when you think you can do it, eventually that will come to define
*  how the government operates. So that's the question I guess I have about this. Do you think that this
*  marks, the fear many of us have is that this marks a real turning point in China where you move from
*  this sort of technocratic government that seemed quite pragmatic to something under Xi that is very
*  different and that will continue to be very different. How do you see that?
*  I think it is the construction of, let's say, a splendid instrument of just a very powerful weapon
*  that they are sometimes able to use for quite good means. I would still say that control of
*  zero COVID made China really, really good in 2020 and 2021 until it met the Omicron variant when it
*  wasn't able to course correct and made people food insecure in Shanghai, which is kind of an
*  unbelievable proposition when the entire city was locked down, that the system improved quite
*  quickly afterwards. But there were a few days to a week when a lot of people in Shanghai were feeling
*  quite food insecure. And on the other side of good controls during a pandemic are what I think are
*  quite a few episodes in Chinese history that show that too much state capacity may not be a very
*  good thing. I'm thinking of a decision in the Ming dynasty a few centuries ago when one of the
*  emperors said, we have these really marvelous treasure fleets sailing out to Africa that are
*  impressing people around the world, that are able to bring giraffes back to the emperor in Beijing
*  for the emperor's pleasure, that these things are pretty cool, but we don't really like that there
*  is so much coastal development. And so they shut down this entire program of building out the
*  treasure fleets. Now this decision may be good, it may be bad, may be reasonable, it may be not,
*  but I think this is just not really something that any other government in Europe at the time
*  would have been able to do. That the Chinese government is a little bit too intent on using
*  things like too many of these engineering approaches to enforce something really devastating,
*  even more recently to something I'm thinking of the one child policy, which was started in the
*  late 70s, early 80s, when the government decided, well, we have too many people, so our solution is
*  to stop births, which resulted in millions of sterilizations, which resulted in babies,
*  mostly female babies being dropped off on the side of roads because they thought that China's
*  population was big. And a real tragedy of that was that China's population fertility was already
*  declining, but what it didn't need to do was to visit this trauma on so many millions of families,
*  especially women, to pursue these types of tendencies. And so I think this is just a
*  problem of too much state capacity that perhaps for human flourishing of various sorts, it is a
*  little bit better not to be able to have so much capability here to be able to do what the state
*  wants, especially if the state is an avowed Marxist-Leninist power that has some revisionist
*  tendencies around the world that it is continuously able to pursue so many big projects that perhaps
*  this is not the very best thing for human flourishing, either in China or globally.
*  So something you focus on is the psychological effect on the population broadly, but particularly
*  on the young. And I feel like it's a dark mirror of your initial argument, the thing we were talking
*  about earlier about the can-do spirit of China a few years ago. You write that the Communist Party
*  has, quote, managed to pull off the impossible, blowing away China's enormous stock of human capital.
*  So tell me what you mean by that. So over the last three years, I've been more or less stuck in China,
*  aside from one trip out in October 2022 when I visited the US. And one of the things
*  that China declared in 2022 was that it was going to make it much more difficult for people to travel
*  outside the country than for Chinese nationals to travel outside the country for ostensibly
*  COVID pandemic control measures. It didn't want people going on holiday to France and then, you
*  know, bringing the virus back with them. And so one of the things it did was that it restricted
*  a lot of passports from being renewed or issued, and that it declared that people who needed to go
*  abroad really had to furnish a work reason or a score reason to be able to go out. And among my
*  younger Chinese friends in Shanghai as well as in Yunnan, this was one of the biggest pieces of news
*  for a lot of them because they really felt they had become enormously stuck. And so when I traveled
*  out of China in October 2022, one of the things I had to do was to pass through the exit control
*  immigration line in China. And one of the people I passed was a young lady who was weeping in line
*  at customs control, I presume because she was denied the ability to get on her flight overseas.
*  And this is one of these issues that created a lot of distress amongst young Chinese on top of
*  the other big thing that stressed out a lot of people in a more latent, long burning way
*  when a lot of his any perceived opposition to him in the party was demoted or retired,
*  that a lot of young people have felt that the tightening trend that they've lived through over
*  the last decade in which they're seeing less room for free expression, that they're seeing less room
*  for cultural creativity, that they perceive this tightening course that asks them to turn their backs
*  on a lot of the Western societies that many educated Chinese have some exposure to,
*  that this wasn't a lot of fun, and that a lot of young Chinese, not just entrepreneurs in affected
*  industries like video games or cryptocurrency or online education, that they have felt that this is
*  a society which gives them much less freedom to pursue the things that they are interested in.
*  There's another group you focus on in the letter aside from the young of China, which is foreign
*  business, which is a community that you know well and study and in a way are part of. And you talk
*  about the Chinese government losing quite a bit of their trust. There is much more effort now among
*  particularly major American firms that have used China as a manufacturing base to diversify. And
*  I know Apple's trying hard to figure out how it can be diversified into Vietnam and India and other
*  places. Tell me a bit about how the last year shifted the attitude of foreign business community
*  to China, given their importance in China's rise. Yeah, so I think that foreign businesses in China,
*  even the hyper-embedded American companies that have been there for several decades,
*  are starting to sour a little bit on China's production capabilities. That 2020 and 2021,
*  that China remained a really great place to produce, that it was able to keep its factories
*  open and really accelerate production when no one else can. But again, these three events that I
*  mentioned in 2022, first, zero COVID, second, the centralization of power under Xi Jinping,
*  which may not necessarily be such a big concern to businesses, but does heighten geopolitical
*  tensions with the US. And then third, this embrace of Russia right before Russia launched its war,
*  that these are things that are making foreign businesses pretty uncomfortable. And I think that
*  foreign businesses are seeing China as kind of a three-headed chimera. One head represents the
*  China of old, which showers, which is kind of savvy. Another head represents something like Japan,
*  which is a large market, but probably won't deliver booming growth in the future. And then one third,
*  something like Russia, in which case these companies may have to leave in a hurry, especially given
*  mostly American sanctions, especially if Beijing makes any moves on Taiwan. And so China is now
*  becoming a little bit more difficult of a place to actually do business. It is not necessarily the
*  most reliable place to manufacture products anymore. And so companies have become much more
*  interested in offloading a lot of their export-bound production out of China. So a lot of production in
*  China is for foreign markets. So producing in China for the American consumer, and a lot of
*  companies are much more interested in moving that component of the business over to places like
*  Vietnam and India. And not necessarily moving everything out because the Chinese market is
*  still enormous and will still drive some growth for a lot of different companies, but moving a
*  lot of their export-bound production to other countries because China looks a little more risky
*  of a place to do business from now on. You wrote something here based on your conversations with
*  foreign executives working in China that I found very intriguing. You said that
*  for executives, a posting to China used to pave the way to the highest corporate ranks.
*  That's starting to feel less the case. China is now so different of a market, given data controls
*  and the political complexities, that a posting there is now being viewed as often a quagmire,
*  as an essential rung on the corporate ladder. Tell me about that.
*  There were a lot of American executives who became CEO after spending a couple of years,
*  standard length of something like two to five years, running the China operations,
*  because that was such a booming market that everybody really needed to have some exposure
*  to because that could have represented a lot of growth in the future. But one of the things that
*  China has done under Xi Jinping is to reject a lot of, at least one can say, liberal values,
*  that these globalist values that are more present in the US as well as in Europe, that the rest of
*  the world will nicely converge onto American, European, Western standards of business. Xi
*  Jinping is not interested in letting Chinese entrepreneurs be part of this globalist class
*  that Xi Jinping has told Chinese scientists that they must be patriots first, that they must do
*  national service in service of a lot of China's strategic goals. He has been fairly explicit on
*  that, in that it is trying to create Chinese major brands instead of global major brands.
*  And so I think a lot of companies are taking a look at that situation and saying, well, this is
*  kind of a different market that it used to be the case that China would factor into a lot of global
*  growth. And that remains the case for a lot of different types of companies, a lot of consumer
*  companies, a lot of healthcare companies, and still some technology companies view China as a
*  major growth story. But that is starting to feel a little bit less the case after China seems pretty
*  intent on taking a direction that is a little bit closer to Russia's and a little bit further away
*  from America's.
*  So I went to China, I think more than a decade ago now, and it was on this very weird reporters
*  trip kind of junket. And even then, in the meetings we had, the fear, the belief was that there was a
*  real estate bubble, that you would hear about these ghost cities full of big apartment buildings and
*  nobody seemed to live in. The government had flooded a lot of money into the sector. It was
*  accounting for quite a bit of Chinese economic growth, despite not seeming like it was using
*  money all that productively. And then year after year after year, you wouldn't have that pop,
*  right? You would keep reading, you'd check into this on Bloomberg, people would still be worried
*  about it, but there'd be some turbulence and then China would stabilize the market and they would
*  get through it for another year. And then over the last year, it has melted down. Tell me a bit
*  about what happened in the Chinese real estate sector.
*  Well, first of all, Ezra, I want to hear a little bit more about this weird trip that you had
*  on this press junket about 10 years ago. What was that like for you to go visit China? I'm curious.
*  I'm not sure my reflections at this point are that interesting because they're very out of date.
*  We had a lot of meetings with officials, with economists, with some business people.
*  The main impression I had then was that everybody seemed to believe that if economic growth fell
*  under 8% a year, that Chinese society, the sort of political stability of it would crack up.
*  And so the party's pragmatism on economics came from this overwhelming view that
*  you really had to maintain a very high level of growth to hold the system stable.
*  And what has been interesting to me in the past couple of years has been a clear end of that view.
*  She and others coming to the perspective that they can hold Chinese society stable
*  even if growth begins to fall and even if it begins to slow and even if they go negative.
*  And that I think actually speaks to the real estate thing here, which as I understand it,
*  and you know this better than me, they made a decision to try to pop the bubble and get to
*  the other side of this. And it didn't really work. But that decision, I mean, thinking back to the
*  trip I had, also bespeaks a sort of political economic confidence that they didn't have even
*  as recently as then. Yes. So I think one of the major things that she has done over the last 10
*  years was that he has continuously, at least for the last five years, to talk down the importance
*  of economic growth. That economic growth, GDP growth, was one of the main ways previously that
*  local party secretaries could get promoted up to higher and higher rankings in the central committee.
*  And she has said, well, you know, maybe GDP growth isn't our most important task. And I think this
*  is something that a lot of people in the West can appreciate that, you know, other things matter as
*  well. And for him, you know, it is things like rural revitalization, it is to end poverty, it is
*  to focus a lot more on the environment. And I think these things can be pretty positive things.
*  But I think it did prompt a little bit of a rash decision to try to pop their own real estate bubble.
*  Here I'm thinking of a lot of the work done by my economics colleagues in which the Chinese
*  government decided that it had a possibly looming financial crisis in the property sector.
*  And that it was pretty intent on trying to deflate this crisis. But subsequently, what they did was
*  they triggered a totally different financial crisis in China, in which construction as well
*  as sales have collapsed. And so, you know, I think this shows that the Chinese government does have
*  a pretty good read, I think, of a lot of its problems. It doesn't always have the political
*  will to tackle these things. And that's true everywhere. But sometimes it's will to tackle
*  things create entirely different sets of problems that were not necessary in the first place. Again,
*  an example of excess state capacity where it is possible to fail when it succeeds.
*  You've also seen in that area, as well as in COVID, a willingness to entertain hard reversals.
*  So for quite a long time on COVID, they have zero COVID, they maintain zero COVID long after it is
*  plausible to do so given Omicron. And then basically all at once, they move to a let COVID
*  rip strategy. Health becomes the responsibility of the individual, not the responsibility of the
*  collective. You note that if you look at the preparation given to hospitals, to the manufacturing
*  sector, to the ability to have fever medications in stores, there was really no coordination of
*  this unbelievably sharp shift in policy. And in the real estate area, they've jumped back into
*  trying to subsidize the sector again to try to stabilize it. So one thing that has been striking
*  is as much as I think the reputation fairly of Xi is that he's much more ideological than some of
*  his recent predecessors and much more self confident and is trying to purge dissent from around him.
*  There certainly was evidence as the year came to a close and going into 2023, that he will
*  take a signal and shift his policies based on it.
*  Yes, I agree that Xi is patient, that he has some pragmatism, that he is capable of tactical
*  maneuver. And he has adjusted several things in the past, for example, under criticism of the Belt
*  and Road Initiative, they made some tweaks there that after entrepreneurs complained in something
*  like 2018 of not getting enough love and attention from the government that he was able to, you know,
*  convene some meetings and try to reassure them. The problem, I think, is that these tactical
*  adjustments are not being missed for the grander strategic goals that he has. One of his signature
*  slogans of the last two years during the hubristic year of 2021 was something called
*  common prosperity. You know, so during the reform and opening era, which allowed a lot of Chinese
*  to get rich, Deng Xiaoping said, it is okay for some people to get rich first, and then later on
*  that these people will have to pull up their fellow citizens and have prosperity for all,
*  common prosperity. Xi has decided that China has become rich enough and that it is a little bit
*  more intent to do common prosperity. The problem is that these types of terms really freak out a
*  lot of China's entrepreneurial class in which this is coded as socialism, that this is back to the
*  bad old days. And so, you know, I think the Chinese government is able to say the sweetest words of
*  encouragement to entrepreneurs, that it is to speak about the economy and the importance of
*  economic growth in totally loving and tender terms. But, you know, this is only after it has
*  strangled a lot of businesses and delivered a comprehensive beating to the Chinese economy.
*  And so, you know, here's where I wonder how many times will entrepreneurs, foreign businesses,
*  as well as young Chinese, really be able to be receptive to these messages that a top leader who
*  continuously has to say that the Communist Party is really in favor of entrepreneurs,
*  if they have to constantly say it, then I think the message hasn't really been sticking, perhaps,
*  for good reason. So one reassessment this has triggered for as they moved a little bit away
*  from such a single-minded focus on growth is there's always been, I think, a suspicion within
*  the American conversation about the Chinese economy, about whether some amount of what looks
*  like success is actually illusion, that it's property bubbles, it's the state throwing around
*  huge amounts of subsidies to firms that, yes, they can do well when they're that supported,
*  but if you took all that out, they wouldn't be able to, and that's a real problem. What has happened
*  in the real estate market, I think, has gotten to this point a little bit. And this does bleed into
*  a doubt about some of the industrial policies that I think are understood as their success and that
*  you very much see as their path up the value chain. So the economist and commentator Noah
*  Smith had an interesting argument about this in his newsletter where he said that Chinese industrial
*  policy, in his view, has largely been a failure, that you look at its AI industry, it's far behind
*  the US, its efforts to build an internal semiconductor industry have been a failure. We come back to
*  semiconductors, that its aviation sector has gotten a lot of money but can't compete really at all with
*  Airbus or Boeing, it hasn't managed to produce a top car brand. There are studies suggesting that
*  if you look at the firms that got Chinese subsidies, that their productivity is negatively
*  correlated with getting those subsidies. So how do you think about the skepticism that maybe actually
*  this economic model isn't working out and that as this sort of tide goes out on some of the
*  subsidies and some of the shine and some of the foreign business excitement, we're going to see
*  actually a lot of hollowness there? Yeah, well I think I would have no pushback to any of the
*  particular pieces of views either collected by Noah or the economic research that shows that
*  Chinese firms are less productive after they have the subsidies. But I think that my picture of just
*  the landscape as a whole, I would say that it is at worst a mixed record of success in China,
*  that there have been two areas that have been I would say pretty obvious failures by China to
*  catch up to the leading edge in global technologies and that is first advanced semiconductors where
*  China doesn't really have much of a position, as well as in the wide-body aircraft in which
*  China's answer to Airbus and Boeing, Comac is really behind schedule and the most important
*  components, namely the jet engines, are still being manufactured in the US in the collaboration
*  with General Electric. And so these are pretty obvious points of failure, but I think if one had
*  to take a look at the entire forest, ignore a couple of these broken patches of dead trees,
*  but I would say that there are a lot of triumphs as well. China is now leading the world in terms
*  of renewable technologies, especially in solar as well as in batteries, and I think that they have
*  a pretty good chance at capturing the hydrogen market as well, that China last year exported a
*  greater number of cars than Germany did, which is kind of a stunning statistic. Now a lot of that is
*  Tesla's facility making cars in Shanghai, but I think it is a pretty successful effort by China
*  in that if you take a look at a broader mass of manufactured goods, something like, I don't know,
*  a hydraulic pump or things like basic manufacturing equipment that don't grace by the headlines of
*  fine papers like the New York Times, well China is pretty sophisticated in a lot of these different
*  components, and one statistic that I like to cite is that the original iPhone when it first came out
*  had about 5% of its value added actually produced in China, and that was pretty much the value of
*  the labor of workers in Shenzhen assembling components, mostly from Germany, Japan, Taiwan,
*  South Korea, and the U.S., and the figure for the iPhone X in 2018 is something closer to 25%
*  because a lot of the Chinese companies are able to make the sophisticated components inside the
*  iPhone. And so I think that China has broadly risen from a pretty low base of technological
*  achievement, and I think a lot of that is still set to continue. That's where I used to work in
*  Silicon Valley, the saying that we have there is that knowledge travels at the speed of beer,
*  beer or coffee, picture or poison. People tend to talk about these sort of things,
*  people tend to move between firms, knowledge tends to travel. China has accomplished a great
*  deal in the past. A lot of technological growth in the West has probably slowed down, in part
*  because it's increasingly difficult to keep pushing forward the technological frontier.
*  This is what a lot of people have acknowledged in the U.S., perhaps even that Moore's Law in
*  semiconductors is really on its last legs, and therefore I expect that China will be able to
*  figure out a lot of these technological deficiencies because these are, I think,
*  still mostly engineering challenges that it's within a very large industrial powers ability to
*  solve. So that gets to what has, I think, begun to really shift in worrying ways, the U.S.-China
*  relationship. One thing that I really hear when I talk to the Biden administration is a sense that
*  manufacturing dependence, not just manufacturing dependence, but profit dependence, U.S. economic
*  interwovenness with China has become for them much more significant national security vulnerability.
*  And so there's a real sense now that we need to change our policies to keep ourselves out of a
*  situation where if China, say, invades Taiwan, we don't have the economic interdependence and
*  manufacturing resilience to have the response that we want to have. And I think semiconductors,
*  in particular, are a place where you really see this. I think the most aggressive thing
*  the Biden administration has done, which in my view goes way beyond anything the Trump
*  administration did, although I'd be curious for your thoughts on that, has been to directly
*  say we are going to try to restrict China's ability to move forward technologically on
*  semiconductors simply because we don't want them to be in a position of parity with us.
*  And semiconductors, for reasons maybe you can explain, I think, feel to a lot of people like
*  they're going to be the energy of the 21st century and the way that a lot of geopolitics was oil and
*  gas over the past half century. Perhaps a lot of geopolitics will be semiconductors over the next
*  half century. So you've studied this industry quite directly. Can you talk a bit about first
*  why semiconductors have become so central in the US-China relationship and antagonisms?
*  And second, what has actually happened there in the policy and the responses to it?
*  Yeah. So I think semiconductors are a focal point for the US for two broad reasons.
*  First, chips are in everything these days. Chips are in electric vehicles, they're in basic
*  vehicles, internal combustion vehicles, they are in pretty much everything. And if you buy all this
*  hype around 5G, which mostly I don't, but if you buy the hype on 5G, that there's going to be chips
*  in the traffic lights, chips in my pen, chips in my coffee, that chips are going to be everything,
*  that this is going to be a super important industry. And then the other fact is that the US
*  has been a major producer of semiconductors up until the last few decades, that a lot of the
*  semiconductor production has migrated to, especially Taiwan, as well as South Korea,
*  and some parts of Southeast Asia, and some parts of China as well. That the US government, I think,
*  has really realized that it used to be totally dominant in semiconductor technologies, which is
*  really important, but that it is still super dominant, I think, in a lot of types of
*  semiconductor production tools, that if you take a look at the semiconductor production equipment,
*  a lot of that is still American. So these are names like Lam Research and KLA Tencore and
*  Applied Materials that are making the actual tools for semiconductors. All the software tools are
*  made by American, this is called EDA software makers, that this is still kind of a US monopoly
*  on the tools. And China is really gunning after this industry, that China has been thinking about
*  semiconductors for quite a long time, that China has announced in plans like Made in China 2025,
*  that it is very keen to have a big chunk of the semiconductor industry market share, please.
*  And the US government is a little bit less excited that one of the few crown jewels left in its
*  technology sector, namely semiconductor production equipment, and still some types of semiconductor
*  manufacturing that really oughtn't go to China, just as a lot of other things already have.
*  And so I think the US government has reacted to constrain China's ability to manufacture a lot of
*  advanced types of semiconductors by asserting its ability to control things like the semiconductor
*  production equipment, as well as the EDA software tools to design chips to China. And that has
*  brought down a lot of Chinese capabilities in advanced chip design. But here is where I also
*  have two broad concerns with the US approach. And here is where I have, you know, let's say two
*  questions about the approach. The first is that I think that on net, a lot of US actions have
*  accelerated China's ability to produce advanced semiconductors over the longer run, that a lot of
*  Chinese companies previously were uninterested in buying obviously inferior Chinese chips, that
*  they were much more interested in buying the best products on the market, which were overwhelmingly
*  American. And after mostly the Trump administration has designated a lot of China's technology
*  champions to, you know, various sanctions lists, that after these companies are unable to buy
*  American chips, well, they really have no choice but to buy Chinese instead. That has given them
*  an enormous push. And so something I wonder is whether the Biden administration has really
*  gamed out the future where a lot of its actions to block Chinese from advanced chips might have
*  actually accelerated the Chinese ability to figure out advanced chips, because previously Beijing did
*  not have a lot of companies on its side. And now they definitely do. The other question I would have
*  about the US approach is to pick at this question of, you know, trying to decouple the two economies
*  on US terms, that the US government is, I think, undeniably still in a pretty strong position
*  in terms of semiconductor production equipment to deny a lot of Chinese companies the ability to
*  advance, that a lot of them are really hobbled after US actions. But, you know, over the longer
*  run, if it is the case that China has the ability to figure out a lot of technologies, first of all,
*  China is making the bulk of mature semiconductors, you know, all the things that are going into
*  washing machines rather than the iPhone, China is able to do. That if the shoe were ever on the other
*  foot, you know, would China, you know, be willing to return the favor and deny a lot of the more
*  basic chips to the US when it's in need? Not to say a lot of these other types of goods that the US
*  no longer mostly makes on its own. That it was, I think, a pretty good thing that in the worst days
*  of COVID, when China was able to produce a lot of the PPE more effectively and more efficiently than
*  American producers could in, you know, the earlier days of 2020, that the Chinese government has been
*  able to sell a lot of goods, that the Chinese government has tolerated a lot of sales of essential
*  goods to the US over all sorts of times, that if someday that the Chinese government loses its
*  restraint, I think it is more likely because of, you know, all the provocations that the US government
*  has delivered, rather than because it has, you know, judged that it would like to close itself off
*  from global markets. And so I wonder if this is actually hurting the US also in the longer run for
*  this reason. I think those prospects are very scary and very plausible. And maybe two things
*  I would add just as thinking about this. So one is that you were suggesting that the US doesn't want
*  an area of technological and economic strength to offshore to China, which I think is probably true,
*  but I don't get the sense that's really what this is about. I get the sense that this is now considered
*  a profound national security question. And the weird thing about semiconductors in particular
*  is that their production of the advanced ones is very, very, very localized. And quite a lot of it
*  is localized to Taiwan, the absolute flashpoint of US-China tensions. I've seen numbers like
*  something like 90% of the most advanced chips are coming out of Taiwan. So talk a bit about that,
*  because I do think there's also a fear on the US side that if China invades Taiwan, their leverage
*  will be the chips to try to keep everybody else out of whatever it is they're doing. Also, of
*  course, the chips are something that keeps America and others on Taiwan's side. This has become to me
*  a very underplayed dimension of the Taiwan flashpoint in the way that Ukraine's wheat
*  did not matter to America the way Taiwan's chips do. Sure. And so this is, again, one of these
*  longer-term questions that I think are unanswerable. But I wonder how much these
*  things are really being gamed out in quite a big way. That it is certainly the case that US export
*  controls can hobble a lot of China's most advanced technology companies. But over the longer run,
*  does this decelerate or accelerate China's ability to manufacture more advanced chips?
*  I expect that it will accelerate, but I could be wrong on that. But how well do we really
*  understand these questions? And if we are really intent on delivering a lot of insults to China's
*  technology sector, is that more likely to protect Taiwan or is that more likely to endanger Taiwan?
*  And this is, again, one of these things that I think are not terribly well thought out. And I
*  suspect that these things really were not terribly well thought out because initially when the US
*  government was doing a lot of these actions, it was President Trump in charge of the process.
*  And I suspect that they did not do the most careful sort of planning and thinking about
*  the long term under President Trump. And more or less, the Biden administration has continued
*  a lot of these different policies, especially to control China's access to the most advanced chips.
*  And here is where, again, I would think about a little bit about what America's technology
*  obsession is and whether China's makes a little bit more sense. And so if I want to create the
*  best case for whether technology controls are good, I think a lot of that has to rest on the
*  proposition that a lot of the competition in the future is going to come down to things like
*  advanced semiconductors between China and the US, as well as a follow on technology, artificial
*  intelligence, and AI. And so far, at least, I'm not totally sold on the case that really the only
*  thing that matters between competition between these two countries is the ability to produce
*  the most advanced chips and the ability to do the hardest AI. I think that, God forbid, that if these
*  two countries were ever aggressively openly hostile against each other, that many other things matter
*  as well. That logistics capacity matters, that production of many more basic things matter,
*  that broad manufacturing workforce matters, that it does not really come down to the most
*  glamorous technologies at the moment. And here, again, is where I would think that if China is
*  able to make a lot of these different types of technologies, it doesn't matter so much that it
*  is unable to make the chips that are necessary for, let's say, mining all the Bitcoin right now,
*  which China doesn't really like anyway, that maybe the US should be focused on a more holistic view
*  instead. Well, where we are going here feels tragic to me. I mean, I'm not saying there are
*  good arguments for it. I'm not even saying we don't necessarily need to go there. I find my own
*  confidence in my judgments in this area is pretty low. But to go back to some of the examples we've
*  talked about here, you have in the very, very recent past and ongoing into the present,
*  real obvious examples of places where fairly good relations have allowed for a lot of
*  advances in problems we really care about. So it really was helpful to us that we could get so much
*  protective equipment and other kinds of important goods from China during the depths of the pandemic.
*  And a world in which China is that much less likely to let people know about a new pandemic
*  or a new virus coming up in its borders, I don't think that looks good from that perspective either.
*  But it's hard to believe that China would be more likely to admit to something to the US now than it
*  was a couple years ago. We've talked about renewables where the incredible advances and
*  drops in price on solar, on batteries to some degree on wind, come from Chinese manufacturing
*  advances. And that has been to the extent we can be in any way, I think, optimistic about our climate
*  path that has a lot to do with this sort of alley-oop between American science and American subsidies
*  and Chinese manufacturing and Chinese subsidies. And people know this. I mean, if you ask the Biden
*  administration, they will admit to all this. And maybe it's good that we're going to have enough
*  competition that's going to accelerate our manufacturing and maybe our science. I mean,
*  you can run other ways of thinking about this. But it does seem to me that there are real tangible
*  examples of places where fairly good relations have been good across a lot of dimensions. China
*  did not politically liberalize in the way many people hoped. But I think that when everybody goes
*  back now in America and thinks it's such an obvious mistake that we welcome China to the global system
*  and they don't weigh on the other side, say, the drop in renewable pricing, they're making a mistake.
*  And then you have the balloon recently, which it's very hard to know what to make of that. And it
*  might have just been like an honest technical error in terms of like our constant spying on
*  each other, but it comes in this sort of moment of heightened tensions and cancels an important
*  visit. It just feels to me as somebody who doesn't watch this relationship as closely as you do,
*  but watches it somewhat closely that almost all now of the political incentives on both sides are
*  on escalation and decoupling. And it's very easy to imagine ways that could go either wrong in a
*  flash, right? Wrong through misjudgments or miscalculations or a spiral of retaliation,
*  or also just wrong because ways that we might have been able to cooperate on issues of importance
*  sort of in the background or just integrate on economic questions and share science and
*  manufacturing costs and whatever are just those opportunities are going to be missed now.
*  Yes, gosh, wouldn't it be great if we were all getting along, Ezra? But I'm afraid that's the
*  logic of the 90s. And, you know, maybe you should get on track with 2023. I certainly find it very
*  strange, all sorts of these crazy incidents, let's say about the balloon, that, you know,
*  I think it could be a defensible position to shoot down the first, let's say allegedly spy balloon,
*  that surveillance balloon, but, you know, to blow out of the sky and incinerate, you know, the
*  probably hobbyist balloon of the bottle cap balloon society, you know, that seems just a
*  little bit weird to me. Now, I think, you know, maybe a more general point on all of this, Ezra,
*  is that I think that in a while, the US and China have become much more tense with each other,
*  not just about, you know, sharing things like pandemic news with each other, not just, you know,
*  working together to address climate issues that, you know, perhaps one other tragedy that, you know,
*  adds another layer of sadness to this entire story is that I think that this competition is making
*  each country internally worse versions of the other that, you know, I brought up in the US that
*  the US government is, you know, pretty intent on constraining sales of American companies to China
*  for, I think, you know, perhaps not the very best reasons, but also that it is, you know, doing
*  things like, you know, prosecuting a lot of scientists of mostly Chinese heritage because
*  of, you know, various pretty small research malfeasance issues related to non-disclosure that
*  DOJ's China initiatives that were ongoing throughout the Trump administration, that this was,
*  you know, not the very best thing for the US government to do to, you know, drive out a lot
*  of scientists and place them under prosecution. That I think it is, you know, a little bit of a
*  shame that the US government is not doing more to try to welcome Chinese students and to try to
*  welcome Chinese entrepreneurs and workers and make itself much more of an attractive society.
*  And instead, the rhetoric is, you know, not always very friendly towards people in Chinese people who
*  may well, you know, want to keenly emigrate to the US. And of course, in China, I understand that
*  there is much greater, you know, disciplining of private sector firms in order to try to pursue
*  a lot of goals that are in line with national government goals, that a lot of these reasons to
*  be suspicious of the West are, you know, in part driven by the sense that the United States is now
*  an implacably hostile power that, you know, wants something between the gradual impoverishment of
*  China to perhaps the, you know, total expulsion of the Communist Party in Chinese society, that they
*  are reacting quite strongly to that and that they are making life more difficult for whole segments
*  of the population as well, that this competition is making both of these countries not on their
*  very best form. I think it's a good place to end. So, as our final question, what are three books
*  that have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience? Well, that's right. It's been,
*  you know, a little bit of a bleak note to end on, but, you know, perhaps, you know, things to think
*  about are the longer term. I read a very good book last year called The Jesuits by a German historian
*  called Marcus Friedrich, who studied the Society of Jesus, which is a quite successful organization
*  that has had, you know, quite a lot of success in establishing itself as a, you know, center of
*  scholarship and having influence in church affairs. You know, a second longer term book that I like is
*  something called Last and First Men, which is a British novel written in the about the 1930s
*  by a Hegelian professor called Olaf Stapledon, who imagined, you know, what the human race would
*  look like, you know, millions of years from now. And so you would have these casual throwaway lines
*  like, you know, 60,000 years later, you know, this is what the 17th iteration of the human race did.
*  And I find that to be a very mind expanding book. The third book I'll recommend is a set of essays
*  by Freeman Dyson called Disturbing the Universe, which talks about, you know, his experiences in
*  trying to do space travel on what I think is a pretty mad idea to get to the moons of Jupiter
*  by exploding nuclear bombs behind a space vessel. Also his, you know, times in the civil rights
*  movement and doing all sorts of crazy things in terms of big science. And so these are, you know,
*  three books that are a stretch across long stretches of time as well as space.
*  Dan Wong, thank you very much.
*  Thank you very much, Ezra.
