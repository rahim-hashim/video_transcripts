# Marilynne Robinson on Biblical Beauty, Human Evil and the Idea of Israel
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIt7Sq_tUa8)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Marilynne Robinson is one of the great living novelists.
*  Her book Gilead won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2005.
*  It is easily among my favorite novels.
*  If you have not read it, you really should.
*  But she has all these other beautiful books.
*  Housekeeping, Lila, Jack, many, many more.
*  Robinson's work has this quality of glowing.
*  There's a holiness to it.
*  And she's been tightening that link in recent years.
*  Her books of essays, her works of nonfiction have been circling her Christianity and her
*  and particularly her readings in relationship to older theologians like John Calvin.
*  But her latest book goes directly to the source.
*  It is called Reading Genesis.
*  And it is exactly that.
*  It is Robinson's deep reading of the biblical book of Genesis.
*  And I'll admit that I wasn't sure what to expect of it.
*  Genesis, if you have read it, is a very strange text.
*  The story of creation of in the beginning and the story of Adam and Eve, of Noah and
*  the flood, and then the story of this wandering family, its lineages, its hardships, its
*  crimes against others, against itself, its despairs, its marriages, its children, its
*  deaths.
*  There's a lot in Genesis to turn you off religion.
*  It does not have the quality for me when I read it that Robinson's work does.
*  It does not always glow.
*  It does not always give off this holiness.
*  And when I read it, particularly when I was young, it was hard for me to look past all
*  the horror in it.
*  So my experience of reading, reading Genesis was unexpected.
*  I mean, I was interested.
*  I was intrigued.
*  I love Robinson's work.
*  And I always feel I should have a deeper literary relationship with the text of the Torah and
*  the Bible, given how central they are in our culture and in my tradition.
*  But as the book went on, and remember, this is the book, Genesis, where God changes Jacob's
*  name to Israel, where the promise of Israel, the nation is made.
*  My experience of it changed.
*  I came to feel more, more challenged, more moved, more sad.
*  We talk about the vengeful Old Testament God.
*  That's not what Robinson reads into the text.
*  She reads and is convincing in this reading.
*  A strange and scrutable forgiveness, a mercy, a grace.
*  Strangeness is, I think, a big word here.
*  There is a refusal in Genesis that she pulls out to apply, past a certain point, easy,
*  retributive moral logic.
*  It would be a mistake to read her book as a commentary on what is happening in Israel
*  right now.
*  But it's also impossible to read her book without reflecting on it.
*  I've tried to hold both those things as true in this conversation.
*  This was not meant to be a conversation about Israel and Gaza.
*  It was meant as a break.
*  It was meant as a moment of beauty in a string of difficult episodes of the show, episodes
*  that have left me exhausted and that I know have done the same to some of you.
*  This episode is that.
*  There is a lot of beauty in it.
*  But the text is what it is.
*  It's also a moment in which to reflect on the religious question that Israel poses, that
*  it is birthed from, and the cosmic distance between that question and this reality.
*  As always, my email, azarclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Marilyn Robinson, welcome to the show.
*  Great to be here.
*  Thank you.
*  You have a gorgeous passage about the creation section of Genesis.
*  And you write, this world is suited to human enjoyment.
*  You quote Genesis here saying, out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
*  that is pleasant to the sight.
*  I'd like to talk a little bit perhaps about the role beauty plays in this book.
*  Well, I'm sort of influenced, I know, by traditional theology that has seen beauty as, in many
*  instances, God's signature in effect.
*  I think that we have desensitized ourselves to beauty quite considerably.
*  The idea that beauty is a harmonizing, interpretive presence in being, and that we very seldom
*  refer to in anything like that light.
*  Beauty, as for example, a physicist might use the word, a beautiful formula, a beautiful
*  theory, that's only used in those special quarters.
*  The idea that God created things out of an aesthetic delight in them means that our consciousness
*  and also the perspicacity that's given to us through beauty as a mode of understanding,
*  that's something that needs to be recovered.
*  A lot of traditional thought doesn't make sense to people because it assumes the importance
*  of the beautiful.
*  One of, I think, the hallmarks of almost all theology, but particularly close readings
*  of biblical text, is the idea that the words come in the order they do for a reason.
*  So what do you make of beauty coming before the utility of nature, right?
*  The sort of utility humans get from nature.
*  Trees make oxygen.
*  Trees make food.
*  Trees offer shelter.
*  None of that is mentioned first.
*  And also coming so early in the text.
*  Well, God does not need food.
*  God does not need shelter.
*  God does not participate in the satisfaction of these kinds of demands that the world makes
*  on the rest of us.
*  But God can participate in beauty, even in the creation of the tabernacle in Exodus.
*  The assumption is that beauty is meaningful to God and it's something that he conceives,
*  that he wishes to see, that he celebrates the fact of people being able to make real
*  in the world and so on.
*  God knows beauty and God enjoys beauty.
*  And he plants the world full of it.
*  We live in his Eden, in a sense.
*  This is something that I've been reflecting on more over the past couple of years.
*  As you say, traditional theology understood beauty as a kind of alignment with God.
*  It's one reason I think so many of the great structures of beauty, cathedrals and mosques,
*  are religious.
*  So many of the great paintings are religious.
*  And I would go even a little bit further than you did in that comment.
*  Now it seems like a lot of artistic culture actively mistrusts beauty.
*  Art is meant to discomfort you.
*  It should be something you grapple with, struggle with.
*  And I don't want to take anything away.
*  That can be profoundly important as well.
*  But I do think there's something lost to beauty.
*  I think we consider it a little bit to our detriment, almost superficial or cheap or
*  possibly misleading.
*  And that there's something in secularization that is at the root of that, that we've sort
*  of rejected this more religious conception of beauty and maybe rejected more than we
*  intended to.
*  I think that's true.
*  I think that very often tendencies in culture like secularism, somehow or other they internalize
*  the criticisms that are made of them.
*  I'm very pro-secularism myself.
*  I mean, I very much like the fact that there is a general world in which everyone might
*  feel comfortable and so on.
*  At the same time, there's nothing about that that should forbid beauty.
*  It's only the fact that when secularism began to appear, people said it was the opposite
*  of beautiful.
*  People say, okay, and they embrace that.
*  They make it true.
*  If you understand the capacity for elegance or beauty in any situation or any construction,
*  it's there.
*  And I think we have impoverished life because we've been told that that's what would happen
*  and therefore we have in effect made it happen.
*  It does feel to me that you have a deeply Christian relationship to beauty and that
*  That has inflected your novels, which I find and I think are widely found to be not just
*  uncommonly beautiful, but a commonly attentive to the existence of beauty.
*  Gilead, I think, is very much this way.
*  It's very much a constant reminder to see what is around you.
*  You'll write about something like laundry as you do in your book Housekeeping and say
*  about this line of laundry that it began to, quote, flutter and tremble and to glare with
*  the light and that the throws of the thing were as gleeful and strong as if a spirit
*  were dancing in its seraments.
*  Is that how you experience of them?
*  How conscious is this rendering of beauty for you when you're doing your work?
*  Well, I would hate to write something that I thought was entirely divorced from the concept
*  of beauty.
*  I think that it's a disciplining of consideration for me as well as one that kind of alerts
*  me to what it is that I'm remembering out of experience that I enjoy in the particular
*  way of beauty.
*  I think of it as something that a mind at peace in any degree and a mind that's schooled
*  toward good attention sees beauty all the time.
*  Do you actually see laundry that way?
*  And if so, how?
*  Or when you sit down to write a book, are you just imagining what it would be like to
*  see laundry the way you wish you could see it?
*  Well, you know, a lot of the early parts of housekeeping are actually drawn on childhood
*  memory.
*  The whole book has a lot of that in it for practical reasons, but I used to watch, you
*  know, like my grandmother or my aunts doing something domestic like hanging laundry in
*  it.
*  It had that, you know, they were very powerful figures to me and what they did was sort of
*  supercharged with it sort of as if it were more than simply drying clothes.
*  It was some mystery that they pursued and that they would in time teach to me and so
*  on.
*  And, you know, I mean, when I think of those words and close my eyes, I see my grandmother
*  hanging clothes on a line.
*  Can I ask about that idea of a mind schooled towards good attention?
*  What do you mean by that?
*  You know, when I was in high school, I had a teacher who said to our class, you will
*  have to live with your mind every day of your life.
*  So make sure you have a mind that you want to live with.
*  And what she was an English teacher, you know, that was exactly what she was talking about.
*  Find things that are beautiful, expose yourself to them at length, give them preferential
*  attention.
*  I don't think anybody ever told me anything that had a bigger impact on my life.
*  But anybody understands the aesthetics of anything, you know, music, visual art, so
*  on.
*  It becomes a kind of sensitivity that spreads through experience in general.
*  I think that people that do science or engineering, they are schooled to see what is elegant in
*  a design or whether it's a design in nature or a design in a laboratory and so on, you
*  know.
*  We are creatures of education, basically.
*  We educate ourselves continuously, badly or well.
*  And John Ames has been attentive to these things.
*  Many people are.
*  This reminds me of my favorite line from you, which is a line from John Ames in Gilead,
*  he's the main character in that book.
*  But there's also my favorite line written by anybody.
*  I actually thought of getting this, I'm going to admit to you, tattooed on me.
*  I have not actually done that.
*  But you wrote there that this is an interesting planet.
*  It deserves all the attention you can give it.
*  And that relationship of attention and beauty, I remember once I did a silent meditation
*  retreat and when I left after, you know, a little bit less than a week, I realized I
*  was unsafe to drive because I was so overwhelmed by just the beauty of the world around me.
*  I couldn't filter it out, right?
*  And this was just normally the normal streets of Oakland, things I pass all the time or
*  did back then and didn't think about at all.
*  And the quality of my attention decides whether I'm going to walk down the street and be taken
*  aback by just everything that is around me or walk down the street and notice absolutely
*  nothing that is around me.
*  So I want to hold on this idea of schooling your attention a bit.
*  I mean, within some traditions that are say Buddhist or others, that would be understood
*  as things like meditation.
*  What is it in your tradition?
*  My tradition would say basically, in its classic forms, that every experience, every moment
*  is a question being posed to you by God.
*  What is wanted out of this moment?
*  Calvin, whom I love and other people disparage without reading, says that whenever another
*  human being confronts you, in effect, you're being confronted by God himself.
*  And the question is not what is your interest in this situation, but what is God's interest?
*  What does he want out of it?
*  And I think that idea that reality is essentially challenging you continuously.
*  What do you understand?
*  What do you see?
*  What do you understand as being required of you?
*  So on.
*  It's a great alertness, you know?
*  And the idea that basically it is God that is posing the question very much exalts all
*  kinds of experience.
*  That's what I would say to the extent that I can speak for my culture.
*  But you know, the early tradition in America of people like Emerson and Thoreau and so
*  on, I think very much reflect the same sensitivity to the idea that we're not just drifting through
*  the world, but the world is actually making itself transparent to us, making us interact
*  with it, you know, in a way that has every kind of implication.
*  I think that's an important part of my own habits of attention.
*  I'd like to move forward in the text a bit to a part that is harder to read is beautiful.
*  A lot is made in biblical criticism, in religious studies of the resonances between the flood
*  story in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the flood story in Genesis.
*  You spend some time on the differences here and the similarities.
*  Can you talk through both how the two stories echo and differ and also what you make of
*  the difference or role it plays in your reading of Genesis?
*  I mean, I think of the flood narrative as old sages, you know, who said, given the fact
*  that Babylonia is swept away by floods at intervals, you know, that people are indiscriminately
*  destroyed and wealth and structures, everything that we have is destroyed.
*  Why would this happen?
*  And so they take as a thought problem the idea of a flood that destroys the world, that
*  destroys the living world.
*  You have in Genesis the adoption of the philosophical question.
*  If all human beings were destroyed, why would they be destroyed?
*  What would be the consequence of their destruction?
*  Noah is rescued because supposedly, I mean, the language is he was righteous in his generation,
*  but we don't know quite what that means.
*  In any case, we know that immediately when he is under a landing, he's no longer terribly
*  righteous.
*  But in the flood story of Genesis, God in the first place says that he will destroy the
*  world because people are only evil in their thoughts from their youth.
*  And then in the way of a forgiving father, he says, I can't destroy them because they're
*  only evil in their thoughts from their youth.
*  In other words, the incorrigible is still loved.
*  It becomes another interpretation of God's coexistence with human evil, that he understands
*  it as being intrinsic in us, infuriated by it or disgusted by it or whatever the anthropomorphic
*  word would be.
*  But at the end of it, he says, this is who they are.
*  This is what they are.
*  He still loves them.
*  He doesn't want to destroy them.
*  So he begins creation over again.
*  You mentioned there is something that happens right after that story, which is Noah back
*  on dry land does not seem terribly righteous.
*  Do you want to talk a bit about that moment and what you make of God's very different
*  reaction, having just been so angry at humanity that he wiped almost all of it out?
*  Now the sole human left in that period or one of the sole humans left in that period,
*  the progenitor of all that will come after is unrighteous, it's fair to say.
*  And God does not act in that way again.
*  How do you understand what has changed and what happened there?
*  Well, God has reconciled himself to the fact that people do things that, you know, the
*  word evil is a strong word, but nevertheless, the resolution that God comes to the reconciliation
*  in the narrative of the flood is that people are what they are.
*  You know, even Noah, who might only have been relatively righteous in the world where everybody
*  was truly awful, even he falls away and, and, uh,
*  Can you say what he does?
*  Oh, well, he gets drunk, you know, and, and, uh, he, uh, is angry at his son for apparently
*  discovering him when he is uncovered in his drunken stupor and curses somebody else more
*  or less at random.
*  The thing that follows from the flood and from the blessings that fall on human beings
*  after the flood, be fruitful and multiply.
*  They come around to the fact that God's great vision of blessedness is many people.
*  You know, what does he promise Abraham?
*  What does he promise Hagar?
*  There will be multitudes of descendants for you.
*  Look at the stars.
*  They will be numerous as the stars.
*  And so the countervailing force in these narratives is yes, on the one hand, people do things
*  that are appalling.
*  And on the other hand, God enormously values the multitudes of people.
*  One reading that you have of what happens as creatures begin to oppose him is restraint.
*  And you say this a number of times that this God is a God now of restraint after the flood,
*  whether that is parable or history.
*  There is this new relationship where things that you might think would be punishable go
*  unpunished.
*  Could you talk a bit about that idea of these places you see restraint and why you understand
*  that as restraint as opposed to indifference?
*  Yes.
*  Well, I mean, I'm of course influenced by the law.
*  You know, I'm influenced by Exodus.
*  In other words, as if the restraint of God, then the next ratcheting is the laws of Moses
*  in which people are given law that presumably should define their behavior and so on.
*  The fact of law actually frees people or respects their freedom because God does not impose
*  the necessity of behaving in a certain way.
*  He gives the information that this is what you ought to do and then you react to it freely
*  by accepting or rejecting it.
*  So in that sense, I see the laws of Moses as another instance of the restraint of God.
*  And I'm speaking of the major ones of Ten Commandments and so on.
*  But one of the difficult things about reading Genesis specifically is that you begin with
*  a God who is making everything happen, who is intensely causal, creating rest and light
*  and animals and every other living and nonliving thing, who is creating floods that wipe out
*  virtually everything there is, who is wiping out Sodom and Gomorrah.
*  And then as you move to the story of the Hebrews, you have a lot of terrible things happen that
*  go unpunished.
*  You have these betrayals, you have these massacres, you have these ways in which people mistreat
*  each other.
*  And it begins to pose a problem that I think most of us face in life, which is why would,
*  how would a just God permit any of this?
*  Meanwhile it is happening among the very people he is in communication with.
*  Tell me a bit about how you read the relationship the God of Genesis has to the evil done by
*  his chosen people.
*  I don't think that the idea of chosen people ever means that they are exempt from human
*  failure or sin or misfortune.
*  God knows.
*  I mean, the end of Genesis is the beginning of the enslavement in Egypt.
*  I think they're chosen in the sense that people that are extremely fit and resilient are chosen,
*  not in the sense of people who are morally impeccable or anything else.
*  Their role is to be representative of humankind.
*  They're chosen in that sense.
*  So they have the faults of humankind and God's dealing with them therefore generalizes to
*  his dealings with the world at large.
*  But I do see a ratcheting down.
*  I do see God as negotiating with people because the ultimate demonstration of his power is
*  that he seems actually to have made a creature that is outside his control in very essential
*  ways or very approximately out of his control, presumably not ultimately.
*  In a certain sense, the freer human beings are, the greater God is because he's able
*  to make creatures that actually oppose him.
*  I mean, I think that's one of the things that the whole text beginning and end tries to
*  pose on our thinking is that God loves people and he does so faithfully and he does so through
*  all kinds of turmoil and shock and disappointment, all of which are in their very outrageous
*  ways proof of the fact that he loves us so well that he even allows us our autonomy.
*  And specifically in Genesis, he loves, attaches himself, develops a relationship with very
*  ordinary people.
*  I mean, in Gilgamesh, in the Greek myths, these are about heroes.
*  These are about characters who feel larger than life.
*  But when you look at the characters of Genesis, Abraham is basically a shepherd, Hagar is
*  a servant, Jacob, these are ordinary people.
*  They do good and they do bad.
*  Often they just don't do all that much of anything at all.
*  They kind of struggle to get their kid married off and then have some internal family drama
*  and then that's sort of the end of them.
*  What do you make of the ordinariness of the people who end up being the crucial lineage
*  of Genesis?
*  Well, first of all, I would say it's universalism.
*  We have no right to assume that anyone who exists is of less value to God than anybody
*  else.
*  And this is a very extraordinary and very uncharacteristic of any period or literature,
*  let alone ancient literature.
*  The other thing is, of course, that people who are powerful, like Moses when he's a
*  prince in Egypt, they think that they are efficacious.
*  They think that they are determining history and so on.
*  And in fact, Moses has to be, in effect, made a shepherd before he assumes the actual role
*  of acting out the power of God rather than his own power in history and the world.
*  One of the central ideas in your reading of Genesis is that it is a book about forgiveness.
*  You write toward the end of your book, quote, the book of Genesis is framed by two stories
*  of remarkable forgiveness of Cain by the Lord and of his ten brothers by Joseph.
*  Could you first describe those stories?
*  What does Cain do and what do the ten brothers of Joseph do?
*  And then how the forgiveness operates in both?
*  Well, in the case of Cain and Abel, Cain and Abel both make sacrifices to God.
*  Cain's is accepted, Cain's is not.
*  No explanation of that.
*  But Cain is sick with jealousy that he has not pleased God and Abel has.
*  So he takes him out into a field, which means premeditation, and he kills him.
*  God knows that he's killed Abel, of course.
*  His brother's blood cries out to him from the earth.
*  Cain says something that is really not very well translated or translatable, perhaps.
*  He says, my crime is greater than I can bear.
*  But he can also be understood as saying my punishment is greater than I can bear.
*  So from the point of view of God, hearing him say this, was he saying, I can't bear
*  the fact that I killed Abel or that I can't bear the fact that I'm being cast out, maybe
*  both simultaneously.
*  But these are things where, again, God could feel compassion for someone afflicted by what
*  is, first of all, disappointed love, because he wanted to give something to God that God
*  did not accept.
*  Of course, God tells him to do it better next time.
*  And then also the fact that he has killed his brother.
*  In any case, Cain goes away from his father and mother, but he builds a city and he has
*  a son and he names the city for the son and all sorts of creative people, people to whom
*  are attributed musical instruments and working with bronze and so on, are supposed to have
*  come from Cain's city, which suggests Cain, in the way of people that are supposedly cast
*  out or punished, he seems to have gone on to have quite a life.
*  In the case of Joseph, Joseph is the son of Rachel, the wife that Jacob loves especially
*  and that he really intended to marry when, in fact, he was given her sister in marriage
*  and so on.
*  She does not bear children easily.
*  She has one son who is very much favored by his father.
*  And the older brothers are so jealous of him that they take the opportunity to throw him
*  into a pit.
*  They decide that they'll sell him rather than kill him.
*  So he goes into Egypt and it's just characteristic of Joseph that he does things incredibly well
*  and he's very successful and he takes on the role of running the household of Potiphar,
*  the first Egyptian that he's enslaved by and then he runs the household of Pharaoh and
*  takes Egypt and the whole region through a terrible famine by storing up grain because
*  he knows from a dream that there will be a famine and then selling it back to the people
*  when the famine actually comes.
*  But his brothers have to come, leave Cain and come to Egypt to ask for food from this
*  bank of food that Joseph has amassed there.
*  And there he is, very Egyptian, speaking Egyptian, eating apart from the Hebrews because Egyptians
*  only eat with Hebrews and all the rest.
*  He's like the disguised avenger at the end of Odysseus, where Odysseus comes back and
*  finds people in his wife's house who have been suitors for her, who have been hangers
*  on and all the rest of it.
*  And so he sort of insinuates himself into the household and then he massacres everybody.
*  You have Joseph in basically the same situation.
*  He's not recognized.
*  He's completely powerful.
*  And his brothers expect him to be vengeful in the way that Odysseus is.
*  And Joseph instead pardons them.
*  He says, you intended this for evil, but God intended it for good.
*  And I've been able to save many lives coming here, which is true.
*  And so he pardons them and seems to pardon them very earnestly.
*  And those are the two framing gestures of forgiveness.
*  One thing you say as you're thinking about the Joseph story is that you understand this
*  is a gift given to him in a way, the ability to forgive, that it is a kind of triumph of
*  particular hero's journey to be in a position to punish, in a position where perhaps punishment
*  would be expected, even merited, but then also be able to feel grace.
*  You talk about what he offers is not a pardon, but grace.
*  Can you talk a bit about that difference?
*  Well, he embraces them as brothers.
*  He weeps on their shoulders.
*  He is not saying, I have taken account of your crimes against me and I'm going to forgive
*  you anyway or give you amnesty anyway.
*  He is saying, that never happened.
*  What I interpreted as injury does not count as injury because it enabled me to save your
*  lives actually.
*  I mean, it's a very, very beautiful image of grace that I think of having no parallel
*  in ancient literature.
*  To be able to look beyond the offense rather than to forgive the offense, I think is the
*  difference between grace and simple forgiveness.
*  From what we're saying here, Joseph sounds in a way like a simple hero.
*  That isn't quite what he is in the book and very much not how you portray him in this
*  period when he has risen to this position of immense power, where he has seen the coming
*  of the famine, he is prepared for the coming of the famine, and he is doling out food during
*  the famine.
*  He is also, in Genesis' telling and in your telling, somewhat responsible for the spread
*  of slavery in Egypt, slavery under which the Jewish people will then exist in labor.
*  Can you talk a bit about that?
*  Well, you know, it's part of the very special genius of the Bible.
*  It sees no one as simple and it absorbs into itself information that complicates the movement
*  of history.
*  It's extraordinary in that sense that when you consider who was writing this and who
*  it was written for, it would be the easiest thing in the world to make Joseph the simple,
*  straightforward hero.
*  But in fact, in a way that is incredibly psychologically shrewd, it sees him as super-serviceable.
*  He's too willing to enrich the pharaoh as he had been, too willing to enrich Potiphar,
*  too willing to serve the jailer as an even better jailer.
*  It's a recognizable human type in a certain sense, the too good soldier.
*  You make much of something that comes later in the books, in Deuteronomy, that says,
*  thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian because thou was the stranger in his land.
*  Later you write that the Egyptian has grievances too and that one of the lessons of the Bible
*  is that it is never so simple.
*  I'm curious to have you talk a little bit more about that, about the emergent picture
*  of culpability, of justice, of justice versus mercy.
*  We have to talk about the Old Testament God as a vengeful God, as sort of eye for an eye
*  God.
*  That isn't how you see them.
*  Why?
*  Well, I think one of the things that runs along continuously with the biblical narrative
*  is that it's clear to us.
*  I mean, you know, a formula like an eye for an eye is very straightforward, very evenly
*  applied apparently.
*  At the same time that what Moses is saying is you can only take an eye for an eye.
*  There can only be an equivalence.
*  If someone breaks your arm, that doesn't give you the right to kill them.
*  So I mean, the idea of this lex talionis, as they call it, the law of equivalence, is
*  that it acknowledges the possibility that revenge of a certain kind can be necessary
*  in a social situation or a personal situation, but it cannot exceed exacting a harm that
*  is equivalent to the harm that is done.
*  So even though it sounds harsh to us, and maybe it's not, maybe we're not living by
*  that standard, I sometimes think we're a very punitive society.
*  But nevertheless, revenge is a very simple concept that people master readily.
*  And they think somebody does something to me and I'm going to, I will be your retribution.
*  I will be your justice, you know, that sort of thing where he's talking about some kind
*  of reaction that vastly exceeds any specific provocation.
*  It tends to be a tendency of the sort of unexamined human mind.
*  But we have that sort of running as a theme in our minds.
*  Am I right there that you're quoting Donald Trump?
*  You're so right.
*  I just wanted to draw that out, what you're saying.
*  It's shocking to hear.
*  I mean, he's definitely pre-Moses in terms of his acuity as an interpreter of law and
*  justice.
*  Yes, I shall be your vengeance is not one of his more subtle comments.
*  So true.
*  In any case, people read the Old Testament and they want to see revenge and they see,
*  you know, that's what they see.
*  Even though very characteristically, this is not what is there to be seen.
*  We are a fallen species.
*  In any case, we have incorporated words like vengeance and so on into the text that don't
*  really belong there.
*  Because that comes out of medieval French and it doesn't translate well a word in Hebrew
*  that should mean judgment, which means that either you are vindicated or you are found
*  a fault.
*  It doesn't mean that vengeance in the sense that we use the word, that you irritated me
*  and I'm going to whack your family, that sort of thing, you know.
*  Same with the word jealous is an inappropriate word in its context.
*  And the Jewish Publication Society says passionate where we say jealous and I think that it's
*  an infinitely more sensible translation.
*  So part of the idea of the harshness of God is a consequence of the ways that traditional
*  translation have supplied language that is not good language in terms of the text.
*  And this is virtually never what the text is actually telling you.
*  This to me was central to your reading of Genesis and it was a way I had never read
*  it read, which is at least after the flood, you in some ways read Genesis as almost a
*  history of punishments not meted out, at least not meted out by God.
*  And I mean, you can go through the offenses of Cain against Abel, of Joseph's brothers
*  against Joseph, of the killing of his whole town after the rape of a Hebrew woman, of
*  one murder and beating and affront after another.
*  And here's this God who's been established early in the text as capable of enormous punishment,
*  enormous power.
*  And that God keeps for the most part standing by and then things that you would not expect
*  emerge out of that, you know, again, to go back to your word, restraint.
*  You write at some point that we are instead to learn that mercy is nearer than justice
*  to godliness and that mercy can release an abundance far exceeding whatever might come
*  of attempting to impose justice.
*  Tell me a bit about that reading.
*  Well, I was speaking there specifically about the fact that God does not carry out vengeance
*  against Cain and that he feeds into this great stream of emerging humanity with his son and
*  his town and all the rest of it.
*  And that there are people that are wonderful and people that are problematical in all this
*  stream of population.
*  But if you extinguish one of them, there is nothing in the text that implies that you
*  have not also extinguished wonderful descendants that they would have had if they had lived.
*  And so the creative presence of human beings is cherished in the fact of their all being
*  allowed to live and propagate because we have no idea of what will emerge in human
*  terms as a consequence of these lives being allowed to go on and prosper.
*  The way forgiveness, the way mercy, the way grace operates in Genesis in your reading
*  is also backed by omnipotence.
*  God has a plan that is working out in ways we cannot understand, but that God can understand.
*  And so God's ability to see his aims realized without punishing Cain or Jacob or whomever
*  is still there.
*  When you ask for the jump, not you personally, but religion, to human lives, we don't get
*  that guarantee.
*  If someone wrongs us, we don't know that there is a plan.
*  And for all we know, our plan requires retribution or requires punishment within a society.
*  And obviously rules and laws will become very important in Exodus and Deuteronomy.
*  But within a society, forgiveness is a powerful ideal, but also, you know, somebody keeps
*  stealing or setting buildings on fire.
*  You're going to want to do something about that, even if you are personally merciful.
*  Why do you think about that difference?
*  What lesson do you take of forgiveness for human beings, given that we do not necessarily
*  have a plan?
*  We have to operate here in the sad temporal present.
*  That's a very serious question.
*  I think that the bias in human society is so punitive that indiscriminate forgiveness
*  bring us to a more approximate relationship to justice than our habits of punishment do.
*  Every once in a while I read about people, you know, 19-year-olds that go to prison because
*  it's the third time they've stolen a candy bar, sort of things, you know, that are just
*  horrible to think of from a biblical point of view.
*  We dispose of people that might be problematic.
*  I think that's true.
*  However, the process of justice might or might not work.
*  And sometimes social safety requires that people be imprisoned.
*  I doubt it ever requires that they be killed.
*  But in many, many cases, I think that if we showed mercy, showed grace, we would do less
*  harm than we do by brutalizing people in effect, you know, taking away.
*  I've been in prisons a few times to do readings and things like that, you know, and they're
*  a bunch of 19-year-old guys.
*  And they're in there for X number of years.
*  And how are they ever going to learn how to live in the world if the only experience they
*  have even from late childhood in effect is incarceration?
*  I mean, things like this where punishment is so destructive that if it can possibly
*  be supplanted, we would probably be a saner, healthier society.
*  Most of the virtues that exist throughout the books of the Torah, of the Bible, I think
*  are things we talk about today, at least mercy and grace and forgiveness and things like
*  that.
*  Humility.
*  The one that is very, very, very, very, very important in Genesis, particularly that I
*  think we do not talk about very much in contemporary, at least American culture is hospitality.
*  It comes up with Abraham, how you treat the stranger, right?
*  It comes up with Sodom and Gomorrah.
*  It comes up repeatedly as almost a central bar that characters have to clear for godliness,
*  for worthiness.
*  Can you talk a bit about how you understand hospitality in Genesis and also what you think
*  has happened to it as an idea or ideal now?
*  Well, you know, people who were strangers, people who were traveling, they were very
*  vulnerable to robbery or abuse or anything.
*  You know, when people say, we'll sleep outside and then Lot or Abraham says, no, no, come
*  into my house.
*  You know, this is a very basic sort of attempt to establish their safety.
*  I think that under most circumstances, people that were strangers were people in hard times.
*  And one of the things that I think is very moving about the laws is that these festivals,
*  which are sacrifices, which are whatever they are, nevertheless, the stranger has to be
*  included along with the Levite and the widow and so on.
*  This sort of refusal to draw a line and say, these are our people and these are not, you
*  know, the refusal to deny responsibility for the well-being of some waifu just shows up.
*  The same is shown in Moses' laws about people being able to glean in the fields or in the
*  great harbors.
*  Putting aside this kind of national identity that's so powerful, a motive and an idea
*  for Moses, there is this fact that we live in a world that is not alien, that is not
*  exclusive finally, that we want to see fed and sheltered.
*  I found reading the last third of your book a surprisingly emotional and intense experience.
*  Because what is Genesis about?
*  Well, one thing it is about is both the birth of the lineage and the divine promise that
*  will result in Israel.
*  Jacob, after wrestling with God, with the angel, depending on how you read that story,
*  is renamed Israel.
*  There is the promise of multiplicity, the promise of a great nation.
*  That nation to some degree exists now and this is, I assume, not the condition when
*  you were writing the book, but in the moment I am reading it, is engaged in this profoundly
*  destructive war, was attacked terribly, has killed many multiples in its counterattack.
*  Having sat so much now in this book about, that is in part about Israel and then watching
*  the modern incarnation of that promise in this moment, what have you been thinking?
*  I've been thinking in a certain sense that what is made known to us in everything that
*  emerges in Genesis and the law and the prophets has surpassed its original intended audience.
*  Israel now I think of as being a nation of the mind.
*  Without prejudice to the modern incarnation of Israel, I think it always probably has
*  its primary reality as the idea that was in a sense negotiated between God and Moses.
*  The idea of land that cannot be alienated, festivals that always fed the widows and the
*  orphans, the openness of the fields to gleaning by anyone who needed to eat, leaving them
*  open to the winds every seven years for wild animals to wander through and all the rest of it.
*  This is a very beautiful dream that would have very powerful implications for any society
*  that took it seriously.
*  When Moses gathers up these people who have been sort of eliminated culturally and takes
*  them with him into the wilderness and recreates them as a civilization, he's doing sort of
*  what Plato does in the Republic.
*  He's creating an ideal culture that with very ancient features like debt forgiveness and
*  so on, very strict limits on enslavement for example, that various things like that that
*  are enormously enlightened by the standards of that period or any period unfortunately.
*  But in any case, he's creating the idea of a country as Plato was in his Republic.
*  We know from reading on beyond the books of Moses that people had enormous difficulty
*  realizing anything that looked like anything that Moses would have wished.
*  And maybe at the moment that society is not historic Israel, but I don't feel that I've
*  been all in a position to judge.
*  I would not ask you to judge or to appear here as an expert on the conflict.
*  I'll speak for myself, which is as a Jewish person, I struggle a lot with what it means
*  to think of Israel as a Jewish state.
*  And of course to think of it as which Jewish state, what kind of Judaism.
*  I've always identified with what gets called diasporadic Judaism, exilic Judaism, the Judaism
*  of the wanderer of the stranger.
*  I wonder about what it means, what having a state does to people, what having that much
*  to protect does to you.
*  And a lot of these books that we're talking about are about wandering and about expulsion
*  and about displacement.
*  But it was striking to me because I think forgiveness is so often associated with the
*  with what comes later, that you understood Genesis, which is, you know, again, the book
*  where the beginning of the idea of Israel emerges, you understood it to be a book about
*  forgiveness.
*  That's not how I've ever understood it, which is partially why I found this a little shocking
*  and challenging to read.
*  But you write towards the end that in every instance where it arises, forgiveness is rewarded
*  by consequences that could not have been foreseen or imagined.
*  The application of this doctrine is straightforward.
*  And that did lead me to think, if you understand there's a connection between this book and
*  that state, what one should say about that if it makes it look more tragic, right?
*  That this is an unseen lesson.
*  If it makes it just natural that this is, you know, retribution and you see that often
*  and God does not exactly judge, at least in the moment, there's certainly plenty of bloodshed.
*  How one is to think about what you say is a straightforward application of at least
*  godly forgiveness in Genesis and the complete inability to have any such thing in the region
*  of the world that now bears its name.
*  Yes, well, Israel, historically, I mean, in modern history is such a radical statement
*  of the question of how to respond to injury.
*  It overwhelms the terms of the question, the modern history of it.
*  I'm speaking, of course, of the Holocaust.
*  I mean, I think it would be better for the ultimate safety of Israel and the ultimate
*  identity of Israel as itself if it had not taken such an extreme vengeful posture.
*  And I think that that's consistent with the text.
*  I think it's consistent with much experience, although, you know, the whole thing is very
*  sad.
*  I mean, I absolutely love Genesis.
*  I'm writing now about Exodus, which I absolutely love.
*  You know, I mean, these ideas of justice and society and so on are very movingly beautiful
*  to me.
*  I'm certainly pained to think that they are not influencing modern inheritors.
*  Can I ask you about Exodus?
*  Sure.
*  There is a part of that book that has always almost troubled me more than anything else
*  in the Torah.
*  I find the Exodus story in many ways extraordinarily beautiful.
*  I think there's probably no story in the Bible and the Torah that has done as much good as
*  the Exodus story that has been as inspiring as it.
*  And yet the repeated hardening of the Pharaoh's heart by God, this being a place where God
*  does intervene, at least textually, after plagues.
*  So a plague will happen and at least across some of them, it will seem that the Pharaoh
*  is ready to let the Hebrew people go and then God will intervene to harden his heart and
*  he does not.
*  What do you make of that?
*  Well, it's a curious thing.
*  I haven't gotten to that part writing, but I will say that in that odd way that things
*  work in scripture, Pharaoh is actually exonerated by the fact that God does not give that decision
*  to him.
*  It is God that hardens Pharaoh's heart.
*  It's not Pharaoh that hardens Pharaoh's heart.
*  And I mean, that is simply another instance of that very surprising tendency scripture
*  always has to obscure blame, to deflect condemnation in a certain sense.
*  The whole passage is very problematical.
*  But it's also true that at the beginning of Exodus, you have Moses appearing like the
*  young revolutionary leader who has this overview of things and his habits of command, you know,
*  is going to rescue his people that he actually identifies with.
*  And no, he ends up running off and becoming a shepherd.
*  You know, he's denounced by a Hebrew for killing an Egyptian, which is so typical.
*  I mean, so how things happen.
*  Can you spend a moment on that part of the story?
*  Because this part is in Genesis and your book reminded me of it and it is very interesting.
*  Moses does kill this Egyptian who is abusing a Hebrew and then seems reasonable to think
*  he will get credit for it and instead and you know, what the text includes, given that
*  does not include all that much is important.
*  He's, as you put it, taunted for it by Hebrews.
*  Can you talk through that moment and what you make of it?
*  Well, it's the one human voice that arises out of the 400 dark years of enslavement is
*  this Hebrew saying, are you going to kill us?
*  Are you going to kill the Egyptian?
*  Who made you ruler over us?
*  You know, this wonderful voice that is like not what you expect, that is not going to
*  say, oh, savior, you know, you've come to get us out of trouble, you know.
*  From that point on, the liberation of Israel is the work of God and it's quite stark, you
*  know, it involves plagues and all the rest of it.
*  But it also means that Hebrews don't do anything themselves that would put them into the category
*  of armed insurrection or anything.
*  Basically, they walk away.
*  That again is a very striking thing because, you know, you know exactly what the possibilities
*  are because the Pharaoh is so frightened of them, clearly afraid that they will take
*  arms, you know, and they won't, they don't.
*  And the rescue of them is accomplished by God, partly by his making it clear that Pharaoh
*  is not a God himself, which would be assumed that he was a divinized figure.
*  But anyway, it's rather than have a story of heroic violence that you would have in
*  a sort of Spartacus revolution, you have Moses coming to Pharaoh over and over again
*  for permission.
*  Isn't that amazing?
*  Really?
*  Okay, take your cattle, you can take your cattle, you know.
*  You would think that Moses would feel that history was at his back, that he could in
*  fact tell the Pharaoh that he's leaving rather than ask if he can leave, you know.
*  It's just an extraordinary, atypical narrative of its kind in the way that it obscures questions
*  of blame, relieves questions of sort of vindictive violence coming at the end of enslavement.
*  It's very striking.
*  These books are, in a way that you get it so well, they are so strange.
*  I mean, you brought this up earlier, but the good that could have been done for the Hebrews,
*  for the characters of them, with a couple of redactions here and there.
*  Maybe don't mention the part at Shemech where the town is told to circumcise itself to prepare
*  for the marriage, and then on the third day after the circumcision, everybody's slaughtered
*  or all the men are slaughtered at least, and their wives are taken and their livestock
*  are taken.
*  There's so much that could have been left out, that strange moment between Moses and
*  the killing of the Egyptian, or if the killing of the Egyptian is not like the Hebrew taunting
*  him over it.
*  One way of thinking about the Bible is that it's all these different people writing.
*  And that may or may not be true.
*  I don't pretend to know, but even there, it's like no editor coming one after the other
*  would have made the choices this set of books make.
*  There's a deep inscrutability to it, the sort of endless merging of the quotidian and the
*  holy and things that make the people who are meant to be followed here look terrible.
*  And I'm curious what you make of it.
*  I believe you believe there were human hands in its creation, but how do you, as somebody
*  who does construct books and edit them, how do you understand those human hands as having
*  made any decisions?
*  One might use the word inspiration, I suppose.
*  I mean, they go back to their own texts all the time.
*  It's a very self-referential literature.
*  And they seem to get the point.
*  They seem to be able to carry forward the things about it that are most striking, the
*  things that are most different from other Mediterranean literatures, classical literatures.
*  They see the moral genius of the text, which is very counterintuitive in most cases.
*  And they can extend that.
*  They can do new variations on it.
*  I have a very, very high estimate of human beings, which answers a lot of questions for
*  me.
*  I think that the writers and sustainers of this tradition were not only brilliant, but
*  also devoted.
*  They were faithful to the text.
*  And the impulse to change it, the impulse to edit uncomfortable things out of it, they
*  were too devout, really, I think, to fall into that temptation.
*  Did experiencing Genesis at this level of depth change you at all?
*  You're a religious person.
*  You were before you entered this project.
*  But this is a real, both within the Jewish tradition and the Christian tradition, deeply
*  engaging with these books is, I think, considered one of the most important forms of spiritual
*  practice.
*  How were you changed?
*  You know, I began with a high, very high but quite undifferentiated admiration for the
*  text.
*  I didn't quite know what I was responding to, except I love the way it reappears in
*  the Psalms and Job and so many places.
*  But I've always been very disturbed by something that a lot of Christians do, which is talk
*  about the God of the Old Testament as being different from the God of the New Testament.
*  This makes no sense at all because Jesus is very inclined to say that God is his Father
*  and also, under certain circumstances, to say that he himself is God.
*  Very monotheistically, of course.
*  But in any case, the split in the two texts encourages misreading of the Old Testament
*  because you're supposed to find vengeance.
*  You know, I mean, people say, oh, Jesus said, love your neighbor.
*  Well, yes, he did, and so did Leviticus.
*  I mean, so often Jesus is quoting the Old Testament and we'd have a much richer sense
*  of what Jesus is teaching if we looked at what he's quoting.
*  And it makes no sense to separate them, as if to say that they're proceeding from opposite
*  stances, opposite theologies.
*  You know, I don't want to sound like I'm encroaching on Judaism or anything like that,
*  but from a Christian point of view, it's only destructive to say that love your enemy
*  is an idea that is exclusive to Jesus when, in fact, in the text, you know, it's perfectly
*  clear where he's quoting from.
*  I mean, I think it's a loss to both traditions to act as if they are opposed.
*  I think that's a good place to come to an end.
*  So then let me ask what is always our final question, which is what are three books you
*  would recommend to the audience?
*  Oh, I'm a scandal.
*  You know, I don't keep up with contemporary writing because I have this parallel life
*  of being interested in Shakespeare and so on.
*  I spend a good deal of time for a while looking at the Acts and Monuments of the Martyrs,
*  which is a neglected major source for Shakespeare's plays.
*  I'm very interested in the 14th century, which was terrible because it had wars and famine
*  and plague and so on, but which produced a great deal of very beautiful writing.
*  One of my favorite books is Piers Plowman, William Langland, coming out of the 14th century.
*  I just finished reading the Theology of Germanica, which is an anonymous work, 14th century written
*  in German, which is a really a very strong alternative interpretation of Christianity
*  in effect, you know.
*  It was very influential in the in the Reformation in Germany.
*  And, you know, I read that kind of thing and other people think, why do I read that kind
*  of thing?
*  But it absolutely utterly fascinates me.
*  It's great happiness to me that I have time and resources to do that kind of reading.
*  I love that.
*  Marilyn Robinson, thank you very much.
*  It's a pleasure, great pleasure.
