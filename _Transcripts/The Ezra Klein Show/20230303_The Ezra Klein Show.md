# The Art of Noticing – and Appreciating – Our Dizzying World
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoKFDWz25sU)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is The Ezra Klein Show.
*  Something I've noticed is when I do episodes that are deep in the arts or the humanities,
*  I feel the need to really put my shoulder into selling them.
*  If it's a show on Ukraine or the Republican Party, the topic sells itself.
*  But poetry, does poetry sell itself?
*  But I want to try to avoid that kind of intro here, because this is a lovely episode,
*  in part because it's not a linear argument that is easy to describe.
*  And that is, I think, the point of it, too.
*  The great poetry is not a linear argument.
*  It's an effort to get beyond that way of thinking about the world,
*  to open yourself up to the deficiencies of it,
*  an effort I'm trying to make more and more of myself these days.
*  So my guest today is Jane Hirshfield. She's a poet.
*  She's the author of many collections of poetry, including her most recent,
*  Ledger, which is probably the book of poetry I've gifted to others most often.
*  She's also the author of two very beautiful books of essays on poetry and how it works in the poetic mind.
*  And if you are intimidated by poetry, I really recommend these.
*  Nine Gates, Entering the Mind of Poetry and Ten Windows, How Great Poems Transform the World.
*  As always, my email, eserclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Jane Hirshfield, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you. It's wonderful to be here.
*  One thing that has shifted in your poetry in recent years is that it has turned to the climate crisis.
*  You said in an interview that during the years when you were writing Ledger, which is the newer collection,
*  the crisis of the biosphere went from something imagined as future to something current, arrived.
*  How did that shift in your sense of it change your poetry?
*  Well, the shift changed me.
*  I had felt a sense of urgency, forgive me for revealing my age,
*  but since 1970, when I went to the very first Earth Day,
*  it's not as though everything we were living through now was not knowable then.
*  You know, Carter had solar panels on the White House roof.
*  Imagine if we had paid attention 50 years ago.
*  But with the California fires and drought, with the Christmas tsunami,
*  which is the one thing which I suppose was not a manmade event, but recalibrated the manmade ones,
*  made me think about the ethical difference between what we have caused and the, forgive this word,
*  ordinary catastrophes of the natural world.
*  It simply became, I had been writing about climate for a long time.
*  I had been writing about the imperiled natural world for a long time.
*  But it became urgent when it became clear it was no longer future.
*  It was here.
*  Could you read for me the poem Let Them Not Say, which is one of the poems that opens up Ledger?
*  Yes.
*  Let them not say.
*  Let them not say we did not see it.
*  We saw.
*  Let them not say we did not hear it.
*  We heard.
*  Let them not say they did not taste it.
*  We ate.
*  We trembled.
*  Let them not say it was not spoken, not written.
*  We spoke.
*  We witnessed with voices and hands.
*  Let them not say they did nothing.
*  We did not enough.
*  Let them say as they must say something.
*  A kerosene beauty.
*  It burned.
*  Let them say we warmed ourselves by it, read by its light, praised, and it burned.
*  There's a striking moment in that poem to me around a kerosene beauty.
*  Yes.
*  And I read that as you acknowledging that a lot of what we've invented, a lot of what
*  we've done, a lot of the damage we've done has a beauty to it, a wonder to it.
*  Air travel is beautiful.
*  Electric light is beautiful.
*  Trains are beautiful.
*  Tell me about the act, the decision, the intuition to acknowledge that beauty in a
*  poem motivated by this kind of fear of the future's judgment.
*  Well, I think that is key to what makes a poem be a poem is that it is not an advertisement.
*  It is not a piece of propaganda.
*  It is not a screed.
*  It is something which tries to see the wholeness of things from every angle and every side
*  in order to see more clearly, truly, to feel more deeply, widely, and perhaps tenderly.
*  And I'm so glad that that line struck you because it is a key line.
*  And it is perfectly true.
*  It also holds, besides holding the beauty of everything we have made and the instrumentality
*  of everything we have made, I have spent years reading by kerosene lamps.
*  And I always feel, if I'm going to speak of these things, that the poem should hold some
*  acknowledgement of the fact that I, too, am creating the problem.
*  I drive a car.
*  I fly in airplanes.
*  I have electric lights.
*  And my own complicity in what we are doing must be acknowledged.
*  No good poem is ever going to be accusatory.
*  A bad poem might be.
*  But a good poem will not do only that.
*  And what this poem was trying to do, I think, was trying to find because when I begin my
*  poems, I don't know what they're going to say.
*  I know the first few words that start them.
*  And then I find out what I'm going to say.
*  I knew that I myself am amongst all of us who are making this future, which will look
*  back on us and see what we have done and whether we have done not enough or not.
*  What do you mean when you say that when you begin a poem, you don't know what you're going
*  to say?
*  The only thing I knew when I started this poem was the opening words of it.
*  Let them not say.
*  Those words came into my mind.
*  And then the next words came into my mind.
*  We did not see it.
*  And then the next words came into my mind.
*  We saw.
*  I had some sense that during that time, this was written in 2014, writing into the crisis
*  of the biosphere was much on my mind.
*  So that was in my unconscious.
*  But consciously, when I write a poem, I listen.
*  I almost never have a preconceived idea of what I'm trying to do or how I'm trying to
*  do it.
*  I have something that troubles me, that fractures me, that requires a different kind of thought
*  and feeling in order to be worked through.
*  And out of that sense, some words will come.
*  I think a poem is a collaboration of conscious and unconscious minds, the way a dream is.
*  Tell me about something you said a moment ago, which is that a good poem is never accusatory.
*  Mm.
*  So for me, there might be somebody else who would have a different definition of a good
*  poem, and they are entitled to their own taste and their own preferences.
*  But for me, if a poem points a finger and shakes it at another person, it is a narrowing
*  of understanding.
*  You can do that without poetry.
*  You don't need a poem to say, jacuz and point your finger.
*  But poems are for me always an attempt to see from more than one point of view, in more
*  than one way, to enlist the collaboration of tongue, heart, mind, body, everything I
*  have ever experienced, and to try to write into an awareness which is larger than the
*  everyday walking around forms of thought.
*  You know, I can have walking around in the everyday, I can have a flash of anger towards
*  certain decisions which are made in the halls of power, but that's not poetry.
*  Poetry is almost the opposite of that.
*  Poetry is the attempt to understand fully what is real, what is present, what is imaginable,
*  what is feelable, and how can I loosen the grip of what I already know to find some new
*  changed relationship, to find something I didn't know until the poem was written and
*  finished and then I know something new and I have been changed.
*  So the thing about a simple accusation, what's different before and after that?
*  Nothing.
*  You knew how you felt before and you knew how you felt after and there's been no transformation.
*  But for me poems are vessels of transformation.
*  They are, you know, the glass crucible that a chemical reaction takes place in and what
*  comes out at the end is a different thing than what went in at the beginning.
*  One of the things that has attracted me to reading a lot more poetry in the last couple
*  of years and years in particular is, I want to call it a fascination, but I think I mean
*  a yearning to have a more poetic mind and I don't mean in that artistic or beautiful,
*  but I mean something more along the lines of what you're saying, which is an openness,
*  that sort of openness to transformation.
*  So I'm curious here not so much about the artifact of the poem, but the relationship
*  between that state you're in, that receiving state, where you describe almost channeling
*  something and the production of the thing.
*  We could say what a poem does or doesn't do, but I'm interested in how you attain that
*  state where you can do that.
*  Yeah, so for me it is recognizably a different condition of being than the person who goes
*  out and buys groceries.
*  Now when I was young there was a quicker oscillation between the two and maybe when I was going
*  out to buy groceries I would more often be hit by a poem right that moment and stop and
*  write it down.
*  But in recent decades I need to find my way to a more vulnerable and permeable state of
*  being where I can hear the voice which is otherwise drowned out by what Gregory Bateson
*  used to call purposive consciousness.
*  And you know, purposive consciousness is very useful to our species, but it is not
*  the entirety of how we know the world or how we navigate the world or even how we change
*  the world.
*  My experience is I must be quiet, I must feel protected, so protected time and space.
*  I can't write a poem if part of my mind is thinking, oh at 10.30 I need to leave to go
*  see the dentist because I need to be able to fall into the condition of listening and
*  dreaming through words and sounds and music and images that arise and magnetize themselves
*  into being.
*  And you can't be watching the clock and do that and you can't be expecting the phone
*  to ring and you certainly can't be checking for emails.
*  And so this sense of a sort of monastery of consciousness, a sequestration, a rowboat
*  in the middle of the lake, everybody will have their own image for this.
*  But I think only when I feel that I can deepen my relationship to what I hear and see and
*  feel and allow to come through me, that's when the discoveries are made.
*  And writing is an act of discovery.
*  I want to ask you then to read, I think what may be my favorite poem of yours, which is
*  from your book Beauty called My Skeleton.
*  Hmm.
*  My Skeleton.
*  My skeleton, who once ached with your own growing larger, are now each year imperceptibly
*  smaller, lighter, absorbed by your own concentration.
*  When I danced, you danced.
*  When you broke, I.
*  And so it was, lying down, walking, climbing the tiring stairs, your jaws, my bread.
*  Someday you, what is left of you, will be flensed of this marriage.
*  Angular wrist bones, arthritis, cracked harp of rib cage, blunt of heel, opened bowl of
*  the skull, twin platters of pelvis.
*  Each of you will leave me behind, at last serene.
*  What did I know of your days, your nights?
*  I who held you all my life inside my hands and thought they were empty.
*  You who held me all your life in your hands as a new mother holds her own unblanketed
*  child, not thinking at all.
*  One thing I appreciate about this poem, which is true for a lot of your poems, is that it
*  brings a very close awareness to something that is always close to us and we are very
*  rarely aware of.
*  And I'm curious, because this is something you do often, how that process works for you.
*  So thank you first for noticing that, because I do think that for me, one large element
*  that goes into this life of poem making is a matter of noticing what is ordinarily unnoticed,
*  both for me personally and also for poetry's work in the world.
*  Other things can look at what's in the spotlight.
*  Other things like to look at what's out at the periphery and find out what can be learned
*  from that.
*  So here we are, always walking around inside what will someday become our skeleton, at
*  least momentarily.
*  And I began to think about it.
*  And I began to think about it.
*  There has been an increasing awareness of science in my poems for quite a long time
*  now.
*  And some of the things in here that might slip by without noticing are just scientifically
*  true.
*  So that a skeleton each year grows imperceptibly smaller, lighter, absorbed by your own concentration.
*  That happens.
*  First, the skeleton grows and grows stronger and then in increased age, we all know older
*  people get smaller and this is by a process of the bone being absorbed.
*  And so this fact, which I'd probably been carrying around for many years before I wrote
*  the poem, suddenly stepped forward and began the speaking of it.
*  And then once I had the idea of, oh, what is my relationship to my skeleton?
*  Why haven't I noticed it much?
*  Why haven't I given it its full credit and gratitude for all the work it's doing for
*  me all my time?
*  And of course, we will go our separate ways at some point.
*  And what of that?
*  And the process of thinking this through, of saying this through, of thinking, you know,
*  your jaws, my bread, also became during the writing of the poem an investigation which
*  carries on through a lot of the poems.
*  The opening section of this book, The Beauty, that came out in 2015, it starts with a run
*  of poems whose title is all My Something or Other.
*  And taken as a whole, I realized after I had written them, they are all investigating where
*  does the self begin and end?
*  You know, this question of is a skeleton, is my skeleton me?
*  Am I it?
*  And what do we do about the fact that cells aren't actually terribly stable or definable
*  things because they are in the end inseparable from everything?
*  They are wonderful narratives.
*  They are stories we usefully walk around inside of that evolution gave our species this world
*  of ideas and concepts and, you know, self-regard and the feeling that our own fate is very
*  important for us to take care of.
*  But I was also very interested in what is our interconnection to what is beyond my own
*  fate.
*  And my skeleton is mostly beyond my own fate.
*  You know, it was given to me and maybe it makes a difference if I run every day or don't
*  run every day or what I eat.
*  But it has its own life and we conduct ourselves for however many decades on Earth as a kind
*  of chorus of two, my lived life and my physical body that it cannot ever happen without.
*  This gets for me at something that has been striking about, I don't want to suggest I
*  have enough awareness of poetry to say modern poetry, but a lot of the poetry I seem to
*  read, which is I think there's a reputation of poetry as particularly contemporary poetry
*  is very abstract, very intellectualized.
*  And yet so much of it is about bodies, animals and the natural world.
*  Yes.
*  There's a deep, intense focus on like the tangible material existence we have in a way
*  that now seems quite different to me than other intellectual disciplines.
*  And I'm curious why first if that feels right to you, but if so, why you think that is?
*  Well, it feels entirely right to me.
*  But I do think that our job as poets, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, one of the
*  of all art is to look at what the central focus of the culture is not looking at.
*  And one of those things in our current moment is certainly embodiment, not the body as object
*  of ads about how to make it more attractive, but our actually lived embodied knowledge
*  experience and the complete joyousness of remembering that we are animals.
*  It is also, I think, one of the ways that poetry expands the knowable.
*  Don't forget the word know itself.
*  You know, there's the biblical meaning of know, which is carnal knowledge, which is,
*  you know, get into bed together and have a wonderful time.
*  That is part of what human beings need to know.
*  It is also part of the seat of our sense of ethics, our sense of justice or injustice.
*  These are bodily informed.
*  All of the emotions are felt physiologically.
*  You can name where in the body you feel them, how they are turning, whether we find them,
*  enormously pleasurable or excruciatingly painful.
*  And this is the information of a social species.
*  It is extraordinarily important that we honor and preserve that, or we will just continually
*  be slaughtering one another because we haven't got the subtlety to recognize, oh, I have
*  just created a separation and that makes it harder to be with this person and do something
*  with them and I need to correct that somehow.
*  Or I have just embarrassed myself terribly.
*  And the three excruciating emotions are shame, embarrassment, anxiety.
*  You know, grief is pure.
*  Grief is unbearable but bearable.
*  Disappointment is just unbearable.
*  It is through the body that we know these things and when it is unbearable and excruciating,
*  we have learned quite sharply behave differently.
*  So poems hold this physical love of the world, affection for the world.
*  And again, you know, we will not save this earth and all the beings upon it because it's
*  a good idea.
*  We will save this earth and its beings because we love it.
*  We love them.
*  We love life.
*  We love being alive for the moment or two that we are in the immense span of time.
*  Poetry is where you get to dwell in these things because it's not trying to do other
*  things.
*  It is its task to reunite us with the senses, with our hungers, with our emotions, with
*  our physical connection to the bones inside of our hands that we so often ignore unless
*  we have arthritis and they hurt.
*  I want to go back to something you gestured it there, which is what we do and don't know
*  of the body.
*  My favorite stanza in that poem is, what did I know of your days, your nights, I who held
*  you all my life inside my hands and thought they were empty.
*  A couple years ago, I read a book about emotion by Lisa Feldman Barrett and one of the big
*  points of that book is that emotions are constructed as we enterosep, as we get sensation from
*  the body.
*  But part of what's interesting about that is how much sensation we don't get, which
*  when you start thinking about it is really strange.
*  I mean, you know, do we feel arthritis in the hands or I can feel a digestion or I can
*  feel my breath if I concentrate, but I can't feel protein synthesis or cells replicating
*  or thinking, you know, I don't feel electricity going across my brain.
*  I don't feel like anything my liver is doing at the moment.
*  It's very strange how much is happening in the body and we are getting no sense data
*  from that.
*  So, the line like, what did I know of your days?
*  I know nothing of its days almost and yet if any of those things stop happening, that's
*  the end of the thing I think of as me.
*  Exactly so, exactly so.
*  And you know, slightly strange association, the wonderful thinker, Yvonne Illich, wrote
*  a book called Shadow Work some decades ago where he talked about all of the unacknowledged
*  labors that sustain communities and what actually happens in the world.
*  But within our bodies, there is an enormous amount of shadow work going on and every once
*  in a while I get to stop and thank it because that's what poems can do, is they can look
*  and say, ah, I forgot to be grateful for the fact that the bones in my feet are all working.
*  Then I can look up in this, you know, strange world of information we live in and when I
*  write a poem that talks about our hands, I can rather quickly find that there are 54
*  bones in our hands and put that in the poem, which is in a different poem, in Ledger I
*  think it is.
*  And somehow crossing the barricade between what is foreground and what is background
*  is very important to me for my own sense of leading as full and broad a life as I am able
*  to, to take more and more of the unseen and at least once or twice in a life bow in its
*  direction, recognize how interconnected and dependent all things are and how continuous
*  we are with those we love, with our friends, with the community that sustains us, with
*  the strangers who we will never meet but who are all making this world together and then
*  with the cells and the trees and the lizards.
*  There is that old idea, Lin-Margulis, the Gaia hypothesis that in fact this world, that
*  we are part of a single bodied world, Gaia, the same way that the cells of my wrist bones
*  are part of me.
*  I think that's a nice place to ask you to read another poem which is from right next
*  door in the same collection, My Proteins.
*  Yes. So the one thing I need to say before reading this for people is to remind them
*  that the word protein comes from the Greek god Proton, which is the Greek god of protein,
*  and the way proteins work is by folding and unfolding. That's how they do the work they
*  do in the body.
*  So the poem began with a New York Times Science Times page article saying that scientists
*  had figured out how itch works. So it began with talking about itch and how itch works.
*  Times page article saying that scientists had figured out how itch works. So it began
*  with talking about itch, but somewhere along the line it morphed into the then not much
*  spoken of, but now pretty widely recognized microbiome that there are millions of small
*  beings making their lives inside of us and that's part of it all too. That's part of
*  the story of self, non-self, beyond self, my proteins.
*  They have discovered, they say, the protein of itch, natriuretic polypeptide B, and that
*  it travels its own distinct pathway inside my spine, as do pain, pleasure, and heat.
*  A body it seems is a highway, a cloverleaf crossing, well built, well traversed. Some
*  of me going north, some going south. Ninety percent of my cells, they have discovered,
*  are not my own person. They are other beings inside me, as 96 percent of my life is not
*  my life. Yet I, they say, am they. My bacteria and yeast, my father and mother, grandparents,
*  lovers, my drivers talking on cell phones, my subways and bridges, my thieves, my police
*  who chase myself night and day. My proteins, apparently also me, fold the shirts. I find
*  in this crowded metropolis a quiet corner where I build of not-me Lego blocks, a bench,
*  pigeons, a sandwich of rye bread, mustard, and cheese. It is me and is not the hunger
*  that makes the sandwich good. It is not me then is the sandwich, a mystery neither of
*  us can fold, unfold, or consume. So yes, that does rather illustrate everything we have
*  just been talking about. You know, when I was a child, I would lie in bed at night and
*  ponder when I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, when does it stop being a sandwich
*  and start being Jane? So I was a very metaphysical child.
*  That's a wonderful cone.
*  Yeah. And the question still, you know, comes back.
*  Tell me about that fascination for you between the experience of the coherent self, right?
*  I sit here, I use the first person pronoun, I am thinking thoughts, I am talking to you,
*  and then the remarkable amount of evidence, both scientific and then when you sit there
*  and a thought bubbles up that you had no volition around, that there is more complexity to the
*  compositional creature I am than that.
*  So I think this sense of the self as at the very least permeable, if not entirely constructed,
*  it really has been a lifelong theme for me. It has been something that perhaps I felt
*  first and thought second. It's such a mystery. You know, we were born into a world, we clearly,
*  you know, at birth, all we can do is open our eyes in absolute state. And I think that
*  all...
*  Right into that sees transcendent, because it says something really good, and that is
*  it.
*  So it's a long story, it begins with, first, the full
*  in schools, larger communities.
*  And, you know, we've got an eye that we need to take care of.
*  There's a reason that pronoun exists in whatever grammar
*  any particular language carries it in.
*  But I think our task as beings, for me, my task as a being,
*  has always been to try to make that sense larger and larger.
*  And less fixed and less in the grip of the narrowest forms of self-service
*  and more available to the larger interconnection,
*  which we are equally and indelibly part of.
*  It gets into things like, you know, mystical experience,
*  mystics of every tradition all over the world, you know, shamans,
*  the Judeo-Christian tradition, Hindi mystics,
*  anywhere you look in the world, indigenous people,
*  there is some embodiment of the understanding of the self dropping away.
*  And for me, these have been perhaps the most important moments of my life.
*  And you don't even need to be in the realm of the spiritual for this.
*  There's a marvelous book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called Flow
*  that probably many of your listeners know.
*  And in that book, he talks about how you can fall into any task,
*  any task which is difficult enough to take your whole concentration.
*  People get a glimpse, a moment of the baseball is coming towards you
*  and suddenly it is in slow motion and you can see every seam.
*  Or the mathematical problem becomes three dimensional and beautiful to you.
*  Or you are listening to a piece of music and there is only the music.
*  There's no Jane. There's no Ezra. There's only the music.
*  And, you know, for most of us, these are rare and occasional glimpses.
*  Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a book saying that she thought it was much more ubiquitous
*  than we give credit to in the way that we talk to one another.
*  But after that came out, I was at a very large lunch table
*  and I just decided to ask everyone at the table, you know,
*  without putting them on the spot, I hoped, but just, you know,
*  as a sort of conversation starter, have you had a mystical experience?
*  When you were a child, did you have a mystical experience?
*  And it wasn't quite as everyone as Barbara Ehrenreich had proposed.
*  It was 80% had had something, especially in childhood.
*  And for me, these experiences, they just recalibrate not only my heart
*  and my awareness, but they also recalibrate my ethics.
*  If you don't think that your fate is separate and single,
*  you will behave differently in this world.
*  Have you had a mystical experience?
*  Well, in my own tradition, one isn't supposed to answer that question.
*  It's considered, you don't want to trot these things out and talk about them too much.
*  But I think you can intuit the answer from that.
*  One of the interesting things about that Barbara Ehrenreich book,
*  and I had her on the show back in the Vox days, and she died recently,
*  and for people who have not read her, she's a remarkable writer.
*  Yes, she is.
*  But she was known as a very leading and very public atheist.
*  And later in her life, wrote this book in part about this mystical experience,
*  as she describes it at times, of a world of flame that she had when she was much younger
*  and was never quite able to shake.
*  And even in our interview, talked about not quite knowing what to make of that book
*  that she wrote herself and not always being sure she should have written it.
*  But one thing that I appreciated about that book,
*  and I see it sometimes in your poetry, is I think when I was growing up,
*  I was told that the science and religion division was between
*  a kind of pragmatic, material, reductionist science,
*  and a wondrous, mystic, open, curious, although sometimes dogmatic religion.
*  And as I've gotten older, looked and studied more science,
*  it's become, I mean, has been since before I was born, but I'm more aware of it now.
*  It is so unbelievably weird and wondrous.
*  And the microbiome all the way to quantum physics,
*  without getting into, I think, very pop versions of these,
*  it is, I think, impossible to bring the appropriate wonder and humility
*  to how different the world is on its fundamental levels and how we experience it.
*  To be reductionist about it has always struck me now as a little bit absurd,
*  because you can't read a new paper these days without being sort of flattened anew
*  by a world that simply does not owe you a experience that accords to its reality.
*  Hmm. Where do I even begin to talk about all of that?
*  So I know most of the friends of this last several decades of my life are research scientists.
*  And you've never met a group of people more susceptible to wonder, awe,
*  and sometimes the mystical dropping away of experience.
*  There is no division.
*  C.P. Snow's book about the two cultures, that's such a memorable phrase,
*  that to this day we have this idea of these binary ways of being in the world.
*  But I once did an onstage conversation for the LA Maine Public Library
*  with the astrophysicist, Sean Carroll,
*  and the subject which was given us was ways of knowing.
*  And we talked about all the ways of knowing that within science and poetry are exactly the same.
*  There is no separation when you are searching for a new description of what is all around you.
*  The same openness is required, the same experimentation is required,
*  the same imagination is required.
*  There's a marvelous quote, the Russian novelist and occasional poet Vladimir Nabokov,
*  who was also a lepidopterist, said something along the lines of,
*  we must think with the precision of poets and the imagination of scientists.
*  And I just love how he mixed up the terms in there.
*  Or didn't.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly. Both require both.
*  And I think this experience of self-falling away into a larger,
*  just shiver of experience, awareness that is not contained,
*  that is its own fullness and sufficiency,
*  that is available to all people and religion might have come out of it,
*  but it does not confine it, it does not define it, it does not hold it.
*  It is simply a place where people who are especially susceptible to that experience might go,
*  although in the case of some religions, they might actually not go,
*  because it depends on the religion and what it is promulgating.
*  You can't divide the world up like a curriculum in a catalog,
*  because human beings will experience what they experience and feel what they feel and know what they know.
*  We can't be put into compartments.
*  You have this lovely line that you wrote in an email to us where you said,
*  art slips through the psyche's barbed wire, it lessens division and increases kinship.
*  And I see a lot of your work, but my proteins is maybe a good way into it,
*  as being about this question of kinship.
*  Yes.
*  As, I mean, we can, it's well and good to have an interesting inquiry about the borders of the self
*  and when the sandwich becomes Jane and when Jane becomes Sandwich,
*  but this question of kinship is a little less intellectual and much more urgent,
*  given the power humans have and also the power we have in relationship to each other,
*  not just to the natural world.
*  I'm curious about that relationship for you of between art and kinship.
*  So I think it is in the very bone marrow of poetry and all art
*  to work through a vocabulary of connection and recognition of the profound interdependence
*  and interconnection of everything.
*  And it travels both ways.
*  It travels, sure, we humans might project a sense of kinship,
*  but we are also part of a fabric of the heart's ecology,
*  which is how the world is sustained.
*  I mean, I don't want to go to the obvious, but, you know, all of the new research about trees
*  and how it turns out that through a mycorrhizal map of underground connections,
*  they are feeding one another, they are communicating to one another, they are kin.
*  And from childhood, that just felt to me a correct sense of the world,
*  that if you are not frightened and you are not angry, everything you look at, you will say,
*  you know, as St. Francis of Assisi said in the title of his famous canticle, you know,
*  Brother, Son, Sister, Moon, that we are all in it together.
*  And that is not the dominant sense of our current culture, but I think it is the means of artmaking
*  that, you know, as I have often, you know, taught when I'm talking about poems in that context,
*  every description is not only a description of the outer world, it is a depiction of a state of soul.
*  Because that is how we work. It's one large kinship system. And, you know, not only between
*  us and other human beings. You know, I really like the idea of, you know, looking at a tree and saying,
*  Uncle, thank you. You know, thank you. Cousin, sister.
*  Can you read for me your poem, A Cedary Fragrance?
*  A Cedary Fragrance. Even now, decades after, I wash my face with cold water,
*  not for discipline, nor memory, nor the icy awakening slap,
*  but to practice choosing to make the unwanted wanted.
*  Decades later from what?
*  Ah, the poem is thinking back to the time that for many years, I didn't want to talk about this in
*  public because it gives people a lot of ideas that I would prefer them not holding. But I spent my
*  20s in formal Zen training. And three of those years in a wilderness monastery inland from Big
*  Sur called Zen Mountain Center at a place on Tassajara Creek. And for those three years,
*  I was living without electricity with kerosene lanterns with no heat in the cabins. And in those
*  years, we only had plastic over them in winter and screens in summer and only cold water tap in the
*  bathroom, although rather fortunately, Tassajara has a hot springs. And so once a day, you could
*  actually get warm in winter because at bath time, you could go have a hot bath. So this poem
*  remembers back to those years of waking up in the morning at 3.40 in the morning, which is the time
*  that Zen monks awaken and wash my face with cold water. And after I left, and I don't like cold
*  water. I really don't. I still don't to this day, but I never stopped that practice for exactly
*  what this poem is trying to point towards or talk about or hold. You know, not discipline,
*  not memory, not the ICU awakening slap, but to practice choosing to make the unwanted wanted,
*  just to do something that you never thought you would want. And yet at this point, I would
*  not change that. I actually, I give myself dispensation if I'm traveling, if I'm in a hotel
*  room, I'll wash my face with hot water. Cause I like it, but at home, always cold. And you know,
*  we've sort of changed the corner. This is a poem about a very different theme. And again,
*  another quite lifelong one, which is, I never liked to name my themes, but I've reached the
*  point where I'm willing to. I've written many, many poems out of the need to find a way to say yes
*  to what I would at first rather say no to because our whole lives consist of such moments.
*  Many things will happen to us that we would prefer not. We would prefer our loved ones don't die.
*  I would prefer the world were more sensible and kind and compassionate. I would prefer there not
*  to be forest fires of such extraordinary devastation as we've been having, or, you know,
*  fill in the blank, but a human life requires all of these things. And so to every day, begin the
*  day with this simple affirmation of, I will make the unwanted wanted has been
*  a practice of decades for me now. Tell me about the act of choosing to make something that sounds
*  very difficult to want wanted in that larger sense to spend three years as I guess, a wilderness
*  monk without electricity. You said in your twenties when you could have been out in the Bay
*  area partying and taking psychedelics. Oh, I did my partying before that. Who were you that you made
*  that choice and what was that choice like for you? So from childhood, I wrote poems, you know, as soon
*  as I learned how to write, I was writing poems. My mother pulled out a sheet of paper when my first
*  small press book came out saying, and you know, one of those big sheets where you're just learning
*  how to write, brown sheet with the wide blue lines on it. And it said, I want to be a writer
*  when I grow up. So that was what I had always wanted. And that was what I had aimed myself
*  toward. But you can't just be a writer. You have to be a person. And I knew that I would never be
*  much of a writer at all if I did not know much more about how to be a human being.
*  And for me, not for everyone, just, you know, me and a few others built the same way,
*  entering formal Zen practice felt like a way to find out more what it is to be a human being,
*  to learn how to pay attention, to learn how to not be afraid of discomfort or being tired or cold
*  or hot or following a schedule that, you know, you don't wake up in the morning and think about
*  whether or not you're going to get up, the wake up bell rings and you get up.
*  What drew me towards it is almost inexplicable. I hardly knew what it was when I first went down
*  the road to see it. I had read Japanese and Chinese poems when I was in college. I had
*  the first book I ever bought for myself was a book of haiku. I was drawn to that particular
*  way of parsing the world. There was something in it that felt to me a gate I wanted to go through.
*  And, you know, when I first went, I thought I would stay a few weeks. I had no idea I would
*  stay for eight years. How did staying for eight years change the way you apprehended today?
*  So completely, it is probably almost unnameable. I mean, not least what luck for a person who was
*  born into, you know, East 20th Street in New York City and had led an entirely urban life.
*  What luck to be able to live in the wilderness with almost nothing between you and the actual
*  world. You know, some plastic windows and some wooden planks. To live in the fundamental way
*  that human beings have lived what we evolved into by the light and dark that the world gives us.
*  The experiment of being in a very small group of people that doesn't change because nobody
*  would go in or out for at least three months at a time. It was so basically human. And, of course,
*  what you work with is, you know, all the parts of you that go, I don't want to do this. You know,
*  I'm tired. I don't want to wake up. Oh, the bell rings. I get up. And it gives you a set of tools
*  for being willing to give yourself over to an experience which is fundamentally tuned towards
*  attending to what is and making the periphery and boundary of the self
*  a little less important. You know, you're still there. You're the one leading your own life.
*  You're the one who has to get up and put your robes on and go in the dark to the meditation
*  hall and then sit there for many, many, many hours a day. But it also isn't you. It is a monastic
*  schedule that has been in place for 2500 years. Does that begin to say anything about this?
*  You know, you have all the experiences. No one should assume that just because somebody is
*  sitting on a meditation cushion, that that means they are coursing in what is called in Japanese
*  and Samadhi all the time. You're thinking, you're itching, you're restless, your knees hurt, your
*  back hurts, your shoulder hurts, you're hungry, you're cold, you're bored, you're having the
*  experiences of the day racing through you. But because you are staying on the meditation cushion,
*  one thing you learn over all those days and weeks and months and years is that
*  these experiences matter. They are the quality of your life. They are the substance of your life
*  and they also continually change. One thing comes and eventually it goes.
*  Something else comes and eventually it goes. And some of that time, your mind is actually simply
*  aware and permeable. And when the first bird of the morning begins singing,
*  there is no separation between you and the bird.
*  You said that the practices of poetry, of Zen, and of daily life feel for you continuous.
*  Tell me about that. In particular, you add the practice of daily life to that.
*  Mm-hmm. Well, they must be continuous. One of the things that I always liked about
*  Zen training is it is recognized as a period of training. It's not like Catholicism, where if you
*  go into a monastery, it's considered a failure if you leave. In Zen, it is considered an opportunity
*  to do one thing intensely enough to get it into your DNA of your psyche, perhaps. Get it into your
*  body, get it into your emotional body, get it into your mind. Feel it. What a luxury. It's like one
*  long Sabbath. I know you did a program on the Sabbath a couple of months ago. And time in a Zen
*  monastery is Sabbath time. But the rest of the week also exists. And it was always very important
*  to me that one of the models is you go back into the world and you look like a normal person and
*  you live the way everybody else lives. Because any knowledge which is only available under special
*  circumstances is not the actuality of our human lives. And so all you're doing in meditation is
*  learning how to wash the dishes well. Neither is prior to the other in importance. If you cannot
*  take what happens on the cushion and have it be present in all the rest of your life,
*  what is it worth to you or to anyone else? And in Soto Zen, which is the school of Zen that all of
*  my training was in, they don't make such a big fuss about the special big experiences.
*  Because the only measure of the meaning of such a special big experience is, you know, how are you
*  when you're, you know, racing to the post office and you find there's a long line.
*  If it doesn't affect that, what is the meaning of it? There's no meaning to it.
*  If it doesn't affect your response to hearing that a war has started in Ukraine,
*  what is the meaning of it? Such a practice only has meaning if it extends through your daily life
*  and how you spend the hours and minutes and seconds of it when you're lucky enough to be here
*  spending them. I'd like to have you read one more poem that brings together daily life and poetry,
*  I think, in a very literal way, which is advice to myself.
*  So yeah, that poem, one of my odd specialties I discovered has been I was an early adopter of
*  writing about computer experience in poems. Things like autocorrect showed up very early in my poems
*  compared to anything else that I was seeing. And this is such a poem. This is a poem of
*  the computer as experience. Advice to myself.
*  The computer file of which I have no recollection is labeled advice to myself.
*  I click it open. Look. Scroll further down. The screen stays backlit and empty.
*  Thus, I meet myself again, hopeful and useless. A mystery.
*  Precisely as I must have done on August 19th, 2010, 1108 a.m.
*  Let me ask you, what makes that a poem as opposed to simply a journal entry?
*  That's up to you. For me, what makes it a poem, I suppose, is that I had an experience and it
*  tells the experience. And somehow, I think it's a funny poem myself, somehow recognizing that
*  this hope that we will find some wisdom somehow. And nope, disappointed again,
*  but I looked before and I looked again now. It's holding a little obsidian shard of the
*  experience of being human in a way that I could write it down and because it went into print,
*  other people can read it and they can laugh with me at all our hope and our uselessness at solving
*  these questions. I had no advice for myself, but somehow admitting that makes it enough of a poem
*  that for some reason of all that you could have singled out from my work, you chose this one.
*  So maybe I should ask you if I'm allowed to, why did you pick this poem?
*  Well, two reasons. One is that I think it's very funny. As you say, it is a very funny poem.
*  The other is it gets at something that you said and that I think is a little lost.
*  You said once that poems began as technology to store information and stories precisely pre-writing.
*  That task is still in their DNA, though other tasks have been added.
*  And that got me thinking about the way that poetry was once the most practical of arts,
*  a way of keeping oral traditions alive, a way of making things easier to remember, more compressed.
*  And now they're understood as these abstractions, these indulgences, little bits of fun.
*  And I'm curious for you because that poem to me walks the line in an interesting way
*  about how you understand that old, very practical form of poetry, the poetry of
*  this happened and I don't just want to remember it, I want to make it possible for you to remember
*  it and then someone else to remember it and their children to remember it and on and on and on.
*  The poetry of an oral culture.
*  Yes. So poetry began as the way to hold things precisely in place before there was writing.
*  Rhyme and meter, the best way for a person of our time and our life to feel this is if I say to you,
*  how many days are there in May? And you begin reciting 30 days hath September, April. You say
*  a little rhyme that holds the information in place because it rhymes. And that was what all of the
*  great epics and the lyric poems and the work song poems of the pre-literate world were doing. They
*  were storing information in ways that it would stay in place and not be susceptible to the forces
*  of the children's game of telephone. Then writing came along and writing, I love,
*  there's a whole chapter in my book of essays, Nine Gates, about the birth of poetry and oral mind and
*  then how it changed when literacy came along. So I'm kind of passionate about this subject.
*  It is things got added. Once you had writing that was able to do the bookkeeping and the genealogy
*  and the etiquette books about how to be a guest at someone's house when you're a traveler on the road,
*  poetry was freed to expand to subtler things, more intimate things, although the epics hold it all.
*  The Iliad and the Odyssey are full range portraits of what it is to be human. Gilgamesh, the early
*  Sumerian epic holds the story of the discovery of death and how we will respond to it when we realize
*  our own mortality, which is one of the great human questions. And I think the work of poetry now,
*  it has never lost its job of holding something very difficult to hold in a pocketable form,
*  a giveable form, something that can be transmitted, something that you can pull out yourself years
*  later when you suddenly think what you need most in this world is to reread Auden's Musée de Beaux-Arts
*  to understand how it is that our culture can ignore suffering as much as it does.
*  But we have also, I think, as a tribe of art makers, I suppose, we have moved greatly into the area
*  of, as I think of it myself, anyhow, poems exist to answer the questions that can't be otherwise
*  answered. These great, deep questions of how to navigate a human life that are not susceptible to
*  medicine or engineering or any of the technologies of the practical world. So poems augment,
*  if you're just hungry and you want dinner, you'll go to the grocery store or you'll pull out a
*  cookbook and you'll make a recipe using whatever you've got in the refrigerator.
*  But if you suddenly want to understand hunger, what does it mean to be hungry? What does it mean
*  to be fed when other people are hungry? For that, you need poems. Poems respond to questions that
*  have no answer that's ever going to stay fixed or set. And yet the questions will keep returning
*  and you'll either go back to the same poem or you will look for a new one or you will write a new
*  one because you are haunted. That is why, you know, we will never have, the world is full of great
*  love poems, but there will always be room for new love poems. The world is full of poems of mourning,
*  but we will always write new poems of mourning because there is no one answer. There is no one
*  set of words which says, oh, this is how you do it. This is how, when your beloved has died,
*  how you manage to open your eyes the next morning.
*  It makes me think of how we have this cliche of teenagers writing their bad poetry,
*  how poetry is very important to, I didn't really write much poetry as a teenager, but poetry is
*  very important to people when they're young and trying to figure out their life. And, you know,
*  in my day, you wrote it on your live journal and it was very emotional. And then it also has this
*  sort of high art dimension, right? You become a poet and that's a very rarefied thing to be.
*  And that that middle has kind of been chopped out of it. I remember talking to Jeff Tweedy on the
*  show as the lead of Wilco and he talked about his father who would get mad and stomp down to the
*  basement and like write angry poems when he was upset and then come and read them to the family.
*  And I found that extremely moving. Yes. That kind of mundane daily use for poetry in a life.
*  And so I'm curious, I'd like to end on this question about that, about how do you use something
*  that has its origins as being so practical, that is still so widely done by so many of us when we're
*  young, how you understand how distant poetry begins to feel for a lot of us as we become adults,
*  either too remote or not something we can do or not something we're good enough at it to do or
*  not something we can understand. How do you think about that gap that opens up between people and
*  poems? Well, one thing to start with, I have a theory because I have seen it in my friends.
*  There are an awful lot of people who never read poetry, never write poetry, but something large
*  happens in their life and they write something. And because I'm the person who write poems,
*  who they happen to know, they show it to me. And sometimes it is a great poem. It's not bad at all.
*  It's quite great. And so I have come up with this rule of thumb that every person has three great
*  poems in them, they just might not know even when they've written one. So this is a universal gift.
*  It is not for the specialized. Just as everybody sings, even people who can't carry a tune when
*  they're alone in the car or the shower, they will sing. It is the inheritance of all of us,
*  as all of the arts are to draw or to dance or to sing or to drum. We are art making creatures
*  and there shouldn't be an enormous division between one person's making and another. It is
*  quite continuous. I do think that for, and of course you're right, for some reason this is
*  very prevalent in the teen years as you are learning to navigate the longings and disappointments
*  of Eros, particularly poetry does tend to step forward at that time. Although I also, when I was,
*  I think, I don't know, 12 or 14, I was writing really angry poems about the Vietnam War,
*  ranting poems about the Vietnam War. So I was a poet interested in the political even then,
*  it seems. But we mostly now, if you want to know where that great central Mississippi River of
*  poetry went, it went into song lyrics. And every song that has words, those words are a poem. We
*  call it lyric poetry because it began as an art, as words that were sung to the liar. And so, you
*  know, poetry is alive and well and flourishing because everybody's, you know, either singing
*  songs that they've heard or making up their own quite nicely. And poems have many kinds of work
*  they do in the world. And one of the kinds of work that they do, they bring people together,
*  say work songs or, alas, war songs. They also honor moments of transition and carry you across
*  a moment when your life is changing. And the one place where you will almost always hear a poem now
*  is a wedding or a funeral. And I've always thought, you know, as long as poems are being,
*  you know, given at weddings and funerals, the art is fine because it is there to serve people
*  when they want words that will help them through these unanswerable, unnavigable moments. And part
*  of that is simply knowing you are not alone in your experience. Whatever it is you experience,
*  someone has been there before, found language to hold, and survived it. The poem is the evidence
*  of the survival. And that brings great comfort to us at the moments we're not sure that we can
*  survive what has been asked of us. And I love humility. I have come to really value
*  this as a quality that helps me get through the day. You know, given our current world,
*  where almost every day, you know, you turn on the news and it's devastating, even now,
*  you know, it's like it never stops being devastating. I thought it was going to quiet down
*  and it hasn't. And for me, one of the great uses of poetry, and one of the great needs for poetry,
*  is an antidote to despair. I am susceptible to despair, but I know it serves no one. And so I'm
*  always looking for antidotes to despair. And poems are a terrific antidote to despair because no
*  matter what is happening in your life or the world's life, if you can write words to have a
*  conversation with what you feel about this, what you see, even your own impotence, even your own,
*  I have nothing here. If you can say that in words that are new and different and distinctive and
*  only that moment's language, you do have agency. You change the world and yourself by changing
*  your thoughts. And first you change yourself and then maybe you change the world and then maybe
*  you help somebody else in their moment of great despair or their moment of great joy.
*  I think that's a beautiful place to end. So always our final question. What are three books
*  that you would recommend to the audience? Okay. This is a strange range of books in that I'm not
*  giving you any poetry books at all. I'm giving you other things. One is a book called Metaphors We
*  Live By by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson. And reading that book completely changed my understanding
*  of language because it shows you how everything we say has its tap roots in the embodied world
*  and how all of our structures of mind and biases of mind are reflections of our first experience
*  of the world of embodied interbeing that we are part of. So one example for that is, you know,
*  why is it so hard for human beings to not be pro-growth even in an age where we understand
*  that unmitigated growth is not going to be good for the planet, people or its other beings? Well,
*  we were born into awareness of life is what comes up from the ground and gets larger. And that is
*  what feeds us and shades us and gives us a place to live and creates flowers and all of that.
*  And death is what stops growing and gets smaller. And so the bias towards growth is good is
*  incredibly powerful in us. And I feel more sympathetic for the difficulty we have dealing
*  with our current problems when I am aware of the fact of how deeply entrenched in our language and
*  our conceptual minds these fundamental things are. So Metaphors We Live By, it's also a good book for
*  understanding how poetry works, but it's much more a good book for understanding how we work,
*  why our thinking is what it is. This next one is going to seem kind of arcane, I imagine.
*  So the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky has a book of essays, Less Than One. And one long chapter in
*  that essay is a close reading of the poem September 1st, 1939 by Auden, one of the great public poems
*  of the age. And as I often tell my students, there is an entire graduate course in how to read poetry
*  in that one essay. If you read September 1st, 1939 in Less Than One, you will know how to
*  read poems. You will know what goes into reading poems. The next one, just because I reread it
*  and felt it was indispensable and invaluable and has not been surpassed for its clarity of seeing
*  combined with an absolute commitment to affection for our fellow human beings,
*  James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time.
*  Jane Hirshfield, thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much. It was a pleasure.
