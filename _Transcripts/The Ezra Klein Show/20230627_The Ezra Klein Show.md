# How ‘Being Animal’ Could Help Us Be Better Humans
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Wxyec3FjY)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So a quiet theme of the show, a quiet theme I think of just being alive at this moment
*  in time is the troubled relationship between human beings and everything that is not us.
*  I mean also of course between human beings and other human beings, but between human
*  beings and the animal world, which we are both a part of and somehow not, or at least
*  like to believe we're not, between human beings and animals, some of which we love and would
*  do anything for their survival like our dogs and our cats, and some of which we raise for
*  the cruelest conditions imaginable and many of which we just don't think about at all
*  and end up affected by our actions but never part of our calculus.
*  But then of course there's also this emergent relationship between human beings and the
*  kinds of intelligences or simulacra of intelligences that we're creating.
*  I'm thinking specifically here of artificial intelligence and the way it has occasioned
*  a lot of anxiety then about what we are and what our worth is if we can indeed create
*  things more capable than us or smarter than us in narrow tasks and increasingly in general
*  ones.
*  So this question of how humanity relates to its own animal nature and then how that relationship
*  or that denial of a relationship shows up in our technologies I think is pretty present.
*  And as much as it sounds like a fuzzy philosophical question, I think it ends up being a very
*  policy relevant one.
*  Policy relevant in our policy towards animals, towards farm animals, towards the ecology,
*  towards the environment, and then of course towards AI and how AI will be created and
*  permitted to present and what kind of training data it has, what we want from it, and what
*  we want and how we'll treat people who are harmed by it.
*  All this was in my head as I started reading Melanie Challenger's book, How to Be Animal,
*  a New History of What It Means to Be Human.
*  She is an environmental philosopher and historian and a beautifully poetic writer and she's
*  also the author of On Extinction, How We Became Estranged from Nature.
*  So she's been thinking about these issues for some time and I think it's a good moment
*  to think alongside her.
*  As always, my email is azraklineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Melanie Challenger, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you very much for having me, Ezra.
*  So you write that the world is now dominated by an animal that doesn't think it's an animal
*  and the future is being imagined by an animal that doesn't want to be an animal.
*  This matters.
*  Why does it matter?
*  I mean, look at what we're facing right now.
*  We're facing a pandemic.
*  We're facing the fallout from that.
*  We're facing multiple environmental crises.
*  And I think we look at the reasons for that in very obvious ways.
*  We look at the politics.
*  We look at the way society is organized.
*  But we don't reflect as often as we should do on either the psychological and the moral
*  dimensions.
*  For me, a lot of the struggles that we face at the moment derive from a particular way
*  of framing our relationship to the world and to ourselves.
*  And I would argue that that originates in the fact that we have a fundamental struggle
*  with being animal and with what follows from being animal.
*  And that's the starting point for my thesis.
*  There was an interesting point you made midway through the book.
*  You wrote that many of the tensions we experience derive from the dissonance inherent in being
*  a predator with a rich moral faculty.
*  And then you pose the thought experiment.
*  How different might it have been if our kind of intelligence had spun out of herbivores?
*  What if a moral system had emerged among the beavers in Canada?
*  Tell me a bit about both sides of that.
*  What do you mean when you say there's a lot of dissonance?
*  In the morality of a predator species?
*  And what might you imagine, which seems like a wonderful foundation for a sci-fi book,
*  if human civilization and intelligence sprung out in a species that did not eat meat?
*  In many ways, all of the book is a thought experiment that derives from starting again
*  with what does it mean if we really examine the fact that we're animals?
*  Now something that's really obvious, but that we don't think about enough is that we are
*  a predatory animal.
*  So human beings, yes, we're omnivorous, but we are predators.
*  So we have hunted and we continue in some communities to hunt animals and to eat them.
*  We continue to consume them.
*  So our farming conditions, for instance, are just a controlled form of predation.
*  All that we've done there is taken the animals that we want to eat or whatever products we
*  want to use from them and we have contained them.
*  But it's still predation.
*  And I don't think we think about that enough.
*  How would the world look if we had a different kind of animality?
*  So if our moral systems, our ideas, our beliefs about our world had come out from a different
*  way of being, if we were a manatee, if we were one of the herbivores that we eat, for
*  instance, what kind of world would we have?
*  What kind of modern structures and ideas and belief systems would come from that?
*  I think that there are several things that we can speculate on.
*  And I'm going to pose this to people.
*  If there is a science fiction writer out there, take on this idea and let's see what they
*  come up with.
*  But I would imagine we would have a different kind of way of dealing with resources and
*  a different, therefore a different kind of way of structuring the world.
*  So consider the fact that we are a hierarchical primate.
*  So we really care about status, for instance.
*  Losses of status are disastrous for human beings, particularly actually for males of
*  the species.
*  And these affect us in all kinds of ways in our biology, in our bodies, but we don't think
*  about them very often.
*  And yet we see them in the world.
*  We see them in the way that the world is structured.
*  We see them in who has power.
*  We see them in the way that we perceive certain people as having more charisma or being people
*  more valuable to listen to than others.
*  We're deeply affected by being a hierarchical primate.
*  Yet oftentimes we just completely ignore the fact that that is what's underpinning the
*  reality that we take for granted.
*  One thing that I always think can creep into this kind of conversation is an idealization
*  of nature.
*  I think when people say human beings are an animal that rejects its relationship to being
*  an animal, rejects its relationship to nature, I think sometimes there's a sense that there's
*  some kind of harmony out there for us to find.
*  But nature is non-harmonious.
*  You've got a very nice line in this book where you write, in one sense, biology seems to
*  come out of violence, whether that is about energy or extreme heat.
*  The solar system and the earth's environments commit horrors on animals, even as they allow
*  for new diversity and change.
*  So it's true, the human animal is a predator, but it is also terrified of predation, terrified
*  of being destroyed by animals bigger than we are, but also by pathogens, also by floods,
*  by heat, by exposure, by drought, by famine.
*  And so there is also this deep scarcity working within us, not because we're distant from
*  nature, but because nature is pitiless at the deepest level.
*  You write about this, and I'm curious how you think that that inflects this relationship.
*  So there's a lot to unpack there, and that's really at the core of the book in some ways.
*  Yes, lots of ghastly things happen in nature, and they happen through necessity, because
*  there are forces of change, there's evolutionary process at work, and there's often an arms
*  race between species, particularly predators, of course, and predators and prey, but also
*  just between the environment and the animal, the ability to get food, the ability to survive,
*  you get communities of animals, but then of course you get pathogens within those communities.
*  So there's this constant battle to make it through.
*  What is beautiful about any living system is that it seeks to persist despite the barrage
*  of constraints or difficulties that are going to be faced and confronted.
*  What I would say is the good comes out of the world and the beauty comes out of the
*  world as well.
*  So yes, we face pathogens or we face predators, for instance, but lots of organisms resolve
*  that by communal living.
*  So they group together.
*  And when organisms start to group together in group living conditions, they form alliances,
*  and that's the basis of our friendships.
*  That's the basis of the intimacy, the willingness that the Samaritan has to help a stranger
*  on the street.
*  When you have people who are willing to exchange information and help one another, you get
*  the birth of all kinds of ideas that develop from that.
*  The concept of trust, the concept of helping another in that kind of way.
*  And you also get that in the body.
*  So if I was to have something awful happen to me and I was to have someone that just
*  sat by me, put a hand on my leg, just talked to me, put a hand on my back and reassured
*  me, my heart rate would come down, my respiratory rate would come down, and I would start to
*  feel better.
*  There's so much beauty that is also made possible from the difficulties that we face in the
*  living condition.
*  And so good comes out of it as much as trial does.
*  You have a wonderful way of illustrating, through actually looking at illustrations,
*  how the relationship between humanity and animals have changed over time.
*  You do that by tracking how cave drawings and other kinds of early art changed over
*  time.
*  Could you talk through that?
*  Oh, sure.
*  I'm pretty nuts about this.
*  I absolutely...
*  This came from a real fascination, like a real personal fascination rather than a cold
*  intellectual one.
*  I was really fascinated in cave art because I was trying to make sense of a particular
*  kind of way that we visualize being an animal.
*  And the kind of mind that we have, the way that we think about animals and exploit images
*  of animals.
*  This was something that I was really trying to get at when I was trying to make sense
*  of not only the things that we fear that follow from being an animal, but what we fear about
*  being an animal ourselves, what we confront in the image of being an animal.
*  I was in Spain at Altamira, which is a site of some extraordinary cave paintings.
*  And it is an extraordinary place.
*  It's womblandish.
*  You kind of enter into the dark cave and then it opens out into this chamber and you can't
*  really grasp what you're seeing until you lie down.
*  But when you lie down on the cave floor, you can see just this zoetrope of images of wild
*  animals beautifully, exquisitely wrought.
*  What you don't see is the shadows.
*  You can see when you're in the cave that our early ancestors were exploiting shadows
*  in order to make their art in certain kinds of ways.
*  Now don't forget that caves were shelters for our early humans.
*  They were places that we hid from predators, that we kept ourselves safe, as well as being
*  places that we might come to worship.
*  These are extraordinary sites that confront us with the kind of mind that we think we've
*  left behind, but actually is still alive in us.
*  What is very interesting about cave art is two aspects of what it means about our kind
*  of cognition.
*  The first is that it is a living document for how our cultural idea shifted and also
*  this sort of psychological way that we related to the living world shifted as we moved from
*  hunter gathering to agriculture and the first of our kind of early civilizations.
*  You find that the first original cave paintings were primarily of wild animals and they were
*  reverential.
*  But as we started, as human civilization started shifting into domesticating their food sources
*  and hunted more for cultural significance really rather than necessarily for necessity
*  or to supplement the trials and errors of transitioning to farming.
*  What you find is that there are less and less and less images of wild animals and when you
*  do see animals in the latter, the kind of real Neolithic shift, you find that it is
*  now the animals surrounded by humans who are in a position of domination.
*  So it's this wonderful catalogue, the cave paintings, of which there aren't a huge amount
*  but they still give us this tantalizing glimpse of a psychological and cultural shift from
*  one of closeness to and reverence for the rest of the living world towards one of domination.
*  So that's something that's very interesting.
*  You have an interesting critique in the book.
*  Not of the dominant or widespread religious systems but of what gets called secular humanism.
*  And your critique particularly revolves around how secular humanism creates a structure of
*  worth between humans and animals and how it at least purports to do so rationally.
*  Can you talk through that a bit?
*  Something that we haven't got into yet is the idea of dualism.
*  So we've talked a lot about the kind of problems that flow from being an animal.
*  So the moral dilemmas that emerge and also the practical difficulties that we face.
*  But one of the solutions here that has cropped up throughout human history in different kinds
*  of ways is to separate something about human beings out from their physical being and say,
*  well, it's this separate part of us, this non-animal part of us that matters.
*  In many ways, that is one of the ideas that came out of original attempts that theologians
*  hundreds of years ago attempted to do when they were trying to make sense of what is
*  it that's special about human beings and what is it that will survive beyond what we can
*  see happening, which is the decay of the body into nothingness.
*  There's this spiritual part of us, there's this soul that survives and it's the soul
*  that gives our life meaning.
*  It's the soul that makes human beings special and it's the soul thereby that justifies
*  what we do in the world.
*  Now once you get the emergence of secular humanism, there's this real need to retain
*  that separation, that moral separation between us and the rest of the living world because
*  we want to continue exploiting other animals, for example, or we might simply want the psychological
*  relief and the moral relief of seeing ourselves as this superior form of life.
*  And the solution comes in with secular humanism to transport the soul, which is a whole body
*  dualism, into just a bit of us, into the idea of our minds, into the idea of our superior
*  cognition, our rationality, our free will.
*  And that little trip, that little move starts happening during the Enlightenment as the
*  seeds of humanism are being sown and we have the emergence of an empirical scientific worldview,
*  which put those thinkers sometimes in tension with this kind of religious dualism.
*  But the solution came in having this mental dualism, this idea that no, it's because
*  we're these rational Asians, that's what makes us separate, that's what only we possess.
*  Now, we're living in an interesting time now, of course, because we have learned much
*  more about the intelligence and sentiency and cognitive skills of other living beings,
*  particularly primates, but also broadly mammals across birds and increasingly cephalopods
*  that are challenging these ideas that it's only human beings who have this absolutely
*  unique form of cognition.
*  So just as Darwin has imposed a problem for the old religious dualism and this sort of
*  satisfying solution to being animal that that provided, now we find that modern science,
*  ironically, is provoking challenges to the alternative secular solution to being animal,
*  which was kind of cognitive dualism.
*  I'm glad we got into the question of dualism because it gets at one of my favorite lines
*  of the book.
*  You're right, we are animals as we embrace and as our bloodied newborns slide from the
*  bodies of women, but not when we make vows.
*  We are animals as we bite into the flesh of our meal, but not in the workplace.
*  We are animals on the operating table, but not when we speak of justice.
*  And that felt true to me.
*  And it made me wonder if really the whole thing we're talking about here isn't simply
*  a mind-body distinction, right?
*  We are animals when we are feeling, when we're running, when we're bleeding, when we're
*  eating, when we're defecating, and we're not when we're podcasting.
*  Right now we're high order beings dancing about in the world of ideas.
*  And so is that the story here that in maybe one of the byproducts of consciousness is
*  just a separation, not even from animals, but actually from bodies.
*  It isn't just that when I am podcasting, I don't feel like I'm an animal.
*  When I'm podcasting, I don't feel like I'm synthesizing protein inside myself.
*  There is a deep separation when you are more and more in your mind.
*  Absolutely.
*  I think a lot of what I was looking at as I began to really unpick the idea of human
*  exceptionalism through time is the fact that it is really strange for us to have this
*  very, very hyper aware state that we are in.
*  Human beings are exceptional and unique in being aware of our awareness.
*  So in having that particular kind of subjective consciousness.
*  And what that does is several things.
*  It gives us the sensation, and I think I say this either in the book or I've said this
*  when I've spoken to people, that it produces this sensation that we can all relate to,
*  that we are somehow carrying ourselves around in our body.
*  So it actually generates a kind of that particular reflective part of our consciousness, which
*  is, I should add, a very animal thing.
*  It comes from our particular kind of sociality.
*  It solves problems in the world.
*  It's not some sort of magic dust in our head.
*  It's come from the fact that we need to reflect on ourselves, that we're deeply, highly social
*  as a primate.
*  We need to be able to keep track on our own identity and also to see into the minds of
*  others to keep a track on them and maneuver and manage the complexities of human interaction
*  in the world, social interaction.
*  That's basically what it's doing for us, but it's left us with this extraordinary legacy.
*  One of the core legacies is that we feel like what we really are in our core is some sort
*  of thinking bit of us that's just being carried around on these legs or on wheels if we're
*  disabled, whatever we might be.
*  We're somehow, the body is just the carrier of this true part of what we are.
*  We can see that sensation has been written as a just-so story of what human beings are
*  from the beginning of time, from the beginning of our recorded history through to now.
*  It is something that you say, okay, we're not animals as we podcast, but actually, my
*  heart rate goes up a little bit.
*  I feel a little bit nervous.
*  I'm worried about not saying the wrong thing.
*  That will probably mean I've got cortisol levels that are peaking right now.
*  Everything about this whole podcasting is going to be really, really animal.
*  That's derived from the fact that we are these social animals where our social interactions
*  and our status within society has a high premium.
*  That's why we get so nervous and our mouths get dry and we worry about what we're doing.
*  That all comes from being animal.
*  Yet, the fact that we can think about it and contemplate it creates this strange disruption
*  between what is still a completely animal phenomenon and the way that we actually then
*  relate to it and think about it.
*  It does come from that weird aspect of our cognition that that's where I think it derives from.
*  I apologize for the heart rate acceleration.
*  No, it's a human normal thing.
*  Don't worry.
*  So this gets, I think, to one of the cruxes of the book, which is what is the consequence
*  of all this?
*  You know, fine, maybe it's weird to be a human being.
*  Maybe we have a weird relationship with our animal selves.
*  Maybe we have a weird relationship with our own bodies.
*  But you're right.
*  What we risk is a runaway process where our fear of being animal causes us to hammer out
*  a more frightening world.
*  Not frightening in the sense that the world is nastier or more violent, but in a paradoxical
*  reliance on technologies that aggravate the existential fears beneath us.
*  And that felt to me, and this goes through the sort of back half of the book, like a
*  place where this was all coming to roost.
*  If we have a divided relationship to ourselves and we are building technologies that exacerbate
*  those technologies may have many more consequences for us than we currently realize.
*  So tell me a bit about that and the role of the path of technological development as you
*  see it.
*  Sure.
*  So the easiest way of doing this, and one doesn't want to be too reductive, but if we
*  look at the core kind of industrial revolutions, the first and second industrial revolutions,
*  we're really about harnessing energy and manufacture.
*  So how can we harness energy to manufacture more goods to make the world work for us?
*  And that then generated huge amounts of opportunities to resolve some of the core problems that
*  we face as animals.
*  So how do we get the food that we want?
*  How do we build the structures that we want and control the difficult natural forces that
*  are around us and build a world that feels more comfortable for us?
*  So that was what was going on in those first industrial revolutions.
*  As they say, they still come from being animal, but they're much more to do with how you can
*  have a safe environment and have access to the right amount of food, get as much food
*  as you can, eat the plow and so forth.
*  But then when we start to look at the fourth industrial revolution now, it's still deeply
*  rooted in being an animal, but it's much more related to trying to control our own actual
*  biology itself.
*  So we start to look at genetic technologies, synthetic biology, AI.
*  These are all actually exploiting the physical stuff of a living being.
*  And what I try to argue is that if we are fearful of being animal, if in fact this is
*  something that we find frightening, and we haven't got into this yet, but this is a really
*  crux part of it, which is that the fact that we are animal creates these difficulties,
*  these things that we face from pathogens to dangers in the world to our mortality.
*  But for human beings, this means that we try to separate ourselves from being animal, that
*  we respond to this both literally in the world and also psychologically.
*  And that tends to kind of ratchet up, right?
*  The more that we try to escape being animal, the more we want to escape being animal and
*  the worse that separation becomes.
*  It doesn't resolve the anxiety, it heightens it.
*  What might follow from the fact that our new technologies are all about the fact that
*  we're animal, they confront us with being animal all the time, they are about our physical
*  being, if that's what we find threatening, I'm not convinced we're going to be well placed
*  until we accept that and talk about that to actually steer these kinds of technologies.
*  Well some of the technologies you're talking about in the book are very speculative, you
*  know, cryogenic freezing and people getting their heads frozen and this and that.
*  But one of them isn't and it's been more of a preoccupation of mine and the shows for
*  a bit, which is AI.
*  Since you published the book and now AI, or generative artificial intelligence as it gets
*  called, has become much more present in people's lives, something we can explore and work with.
*  And it often strikes me that a lot of the anxiety people feel when they interface with
*  these programs has to do with this question of how we judge our worth separate from our
*  animalness.
*  There's a lot in our animalness that AI we know has no relationship to.
*  It can't listen to music, it can't birth a child, it can't feel a lot of what we can
*  feel, the sort of embodied nature of our intelligence that it doesn't have.
*  But if you build your worth as a human being off of creative cognitive processes, which
*  we often do because we measure people through their value to the economy, and you have now
*  systems that can write an essay as well as a human being or come up with the answers
*  to scientific questions as well as a human being or whatever it might be, and some of
*  them we don't have yet but we will soon, then you end up in very dangerous metaphysical
*  species.
*  And I'm not the first to observe this, Megan O'Geeblen and others have made this point,
*  but that the ways in which AI is shaking our sense of self seems precisely related to how
*  narrow and distant from our sensations and our bodies our sense of worth had become.
*  There's a beautiful provocation there, isn't there?
*  So if we go back to this idea that separating ourselves from being animal in many different
*  ways has solved the moral problem that we might face.
*  So why do we justify factory farming, for instance?
*  How do we justify the extent to which we utilize and exploit the living world?
*  How do we justify the kina systems that are leading to climate change?
*  We often fall back on this idea where human beings are the only ones with moral worth
*  and we have our moral worth, which is grounded in our particular capacities, the fact that
*  we are incredibly intelligent, that we are rational, that we live in a cultural world,
*  that we're symbolic thinkers and so forth.
*  So we have ordered a whole system of justification around our intelligence.
*  Now, one can speculate on what's going to happen when we find that we are confronted
*  by a non-animal system, but that has superior capacities, superior forms of rationality
*  than us because human beings are not, in fact, brilliantly rational.
*  We're very biased.
*  We're biased even just if we've had a sandwich that day, let alone what our politics happen
*  to be.
*  Our memories are imperfect.
*  They're more to do with tracking who we are and not necessarily to do with remembering
*  events perfectly.
*  So human beings are, because we're animals, we're flawed in our intelligence.
*  Yes, we are highly intelligent and interesting abstract thinkers and cultural thinkers for
*  sure, but we're still animals.
*  It's still an animal intelligence.
*  It's flawed.
*  It does a good job.
*  It never does a perfect job because evolution doesn't work that way.
*  It does a good job, but there are always kind of, you know, there are payoffs.
*  But what if we end up with this synthetic intelligence that we've generated that can
*  outthink us, outsmart us, is more rational and is more reasonable?
*  Will we then need to flip into a new system of justification that actually leans back
*  into our animality, that it is our capacity for sensation, that it is our capacity for
*  emotion, for love, maybe even our ability to be wild and irrational, that is what is
*  beautiful and meaningful?
*  That's possible that that could be the kind of psychological move that we make, but then
*  where will that leave our relationship to the rest of the living world that we've justified
*  exploiting because they aren't like that, you know, because they're animals and we're
*  these kind of pseudo machines.
*  So it's an extremely interesting time.
*  Given that you wrote a book that I think in many ways was revolving around these questions,
*  how have you experienced this period?
*  I'm sure you've played with some of these systems.
*  I'm sure you've been following a lot of this conversation.
*  I mean, you say this will be an interesting time, but how has that actually changed your
*  thinking?
*  I'm deeply concerned about two things that I think don't get enough time.
*  I'll have to backtrack a wee bit.
*  So within the fact that we face threats as animals and that we are these highly social
*  primates that build alliances in the world that are competitive and positive, right?
*  So we have this particular kind of social cognition human beings that places a huge
*  premium on intelligence, on being able to judge what another person is thinking and
*  judge their actions and manage to sort of maneuver the social space that we're in.
*  What we find with human beings is that we are mind readers.
*  We're constantly trying to judge intelligences and this is massively affected by whether
*  we're in the group or out the group, right?
*  So in-group, out-group tensions.
*  And there are different complex processes here.
*  It's not unsubtle, but there's a wealth of evidence that you tend to attribute more mind,
*  more intelligence, more agency, and not just that, but more emotion and more secondary
*  emotions to those who are within your group and those who are out of your group, so our
*  competitors potentially, and especially those that you might want to exploit in some kind
*  of way.
*  You attribute less intelligence to less secondary emotions.
*  And in the worst and most kind of ghastly of cases, we can even completely dehumanize
*  and objectify people if we want to exploit or be aggressive towards them.
*  So there's this constant interplay of tensions that are based around whether we attribute
*  mind or not to others.
*  What is that going to do in an industrial revolution that is all about intelligence?
*  Let's say we get AI that is actually getting smarter faster than we're realizing it.
*  If we tend to kind of objectify the machines or the intelligence of others, how likely
*  are we to be good at mind reading a synthetic mind that we've generated?
*  How good are we likely to be at judging?
*  That's something that I greatly worry about, but I also worry that with kind of deepfake
*  and AI, the way it could be exploited will exploit those in-group, out-group tensions
*  that I've described and are likely to amplify them.
*  That's something that I'm greatly concerned about.
*  Well, there's also this way in which it boomerangs back on us.
*  I mean, we're not going to be good at reading AI minds.
*  We're not good at it now.
*  We have built a thing to fool ourselves, first and foremost, right?
*  We could have tuned this in any way we wanted.
*  We tuned it to seem like us to us.
*  It's again a widely made observation now, but the underlying power of the GPT programs
*  that OpenAAS put out has been around for a very long time.
*  They only exploded when they put this wrapper around their GPT programs, now called ChatGPT,
*  that made it easy to converse with it in a very human-seeming way.
*  So the more we fooled ourselves by making it seem like us to us, even though it is anything
*  but like us, the more we liked it.
*  Something you talk about in the book that comes up a lot is a way where an embodied
*  intelligence – you have a lovely section on these experiments that I always think are
*  fascinating about people for whom the hemispheres of their brains were separated.
*  And one part of the brain will sense a threat, and the other part of the brain will create
*  a story about that.
*  But when they're separated and can't communicate, you often have people reacting to a threat,
*  but the other part of the brain is coming up with stories without enough information,
*  and the stories are ridiculous.
*  And so you end up in this funny way where a core part of what we are is the body, but
*  we have dismissed that and increasing our metaphors of what we are and how we think
*  and what makes us more than animal or thinner and thinner because in trying to explain computers
*  to ourselves, we have explained ourselves as computers.
*  And one of the things I worry about is that I think that a lot of human dignity is standing
*  on a very narrow precipice.
*  And we have plenty of belief systems and reasons to have a thicker sense of what makes a human
*  being or any kind of life special.
*  But I'm not sure we've done enough to confront how much damage we've done to that thinking
*  over the past couple of centuries.
*  Absolutely.
*  And it's very interesting to go back to the archive of John von Neumann, Alan Turing,
*  the thinkers who were beginning the computer age.
*  They weren't at the absolute start of it, but there's a huge amount of writings that
*  we got from that time as it was really kicking off where you do see this computer metaphor
*  really bed down.
*  We were still having the fallout from the horrors that followed from the slave trade.
*  These were people that had been reduced just to their bodies, if you like, that women were
*  not seen as rationals, that they were just seen as these sort of embodied, irrational
*  creatures who couldn't be trusted with their emotions, couldn't be trusted to vote and
*  so forth, and that the slaves were reduced to only the labor that they could provide
*  and none of the full faculties of their humanity.
*  Meanwhile, we have the emergence at the same kind of time of this idea that what is superior
*  about us or what is valuable about a select number of us within society is this computer-like
*  intelligence.
*  And we should be reflecting on that history as we face a world that is now placing a huge
*  premium on only a very particular kind of cognition.
*  AI is only a certain kind of intelligence.
*  It's not even all of the forms.
*  Yes, okay, some of the systems are trying to aim towards general intelligence, but they're
*  not really anywhere near human general intelligence at the moment.
*  That is the kind of singularity that people are talking about.
*  We don't have anything like that.
*  We just have a very particular stripped down, very logical form of intelligence, of computation
*  that AI is good at.
*  And the worry is that we're still living by that metaphor.
*  But as you say, in fact, intelligence, human intelligence is beautiful for its complexity,
*  not just human intelligence, but animal intelligence more broadly.
*  The intelligence of your immune system is remarkable.
*  The ability of your immune system to know the difference between what's not you and
*  what is.
*  None of that's a kind of rational calculating intelligence, but it is intelligent and it
*  is beautiful.
*  The ability of a mother's body to sync with their child when they're breastfeeding, that's
*  intelligence, but it's not the kind of intelligence that we're placing a premium on now.
*  You quote a beautiful poem from Galway Cannell written in 1980 that says, sometimes it is
*  necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness.
*  And I take that as a big project of the book.
*  So as we come to a close here, how have you come to think about your own loveliness or
*  the loveliness of those around you?
*  And how does it change your experience of them or the world in which you and them live?
*  It is frightening being an animal.
*  We all are frightened by the fact that we're going to die.
*  You know, that's at the core of it.
*  None of us want to get hurt.
*  None of us want to be humiliated or to be in pain or suffer or diseased.
*  Of course, none of us want to be hungry or to starve.
*  All of these deeply animal threats are real and they frighten us.
*  But there's also so much about the real lived embodied beauty of the animal world and the
*  animal condition that we can cherish.
*  A lot of that stems from our alliances.
*  And these alliances start with one another.
*  They generally, in fact, in mammals like us tend to start between the mother and the child.
*  But they're also there between lovers of any kind.
*  Any kind of lover will sync their brainwaves with one another.
*  They'll have oxytocin spikes.
*  When you look at your dog today, you know, you turn around to your dog and you stroke
*  their back.
*  That's a really classic mimicking of the licking that a mother will do from the top of the
*  head of a mammal through to the kind of right way down the spine.
*  It will make the animal feel better.
*  It's the same if you do it to your cat.
*  It's the same if you do it to your horse.
*  It's the same if you do it to your child.
*  And it causes this kind of flow of warm, positive sensations of togetherness, of trust, of alliance.
*  We're capable of this.
*  I think what is really beautiful about human beings is that we do have something that is
*  very, very unique about us as animals.
*  And that's that we can build alliances with any other species.
*  It's really quite an extraordinary way of taking initially a useful capability that's
*  evolved.
*  So the ability to build loving, supportive, safe relationships to save us from the difficulties
*  of life with our family, with our friends, with our community.
*  And we've been able to generalize that.
*  That is really an extraordinary way of being able to generalize love, being able to generalize
*  passion, generalize kindness.
*  So as I worked on this book, I have to be honest that a lot of what I was looking at
*  were really quite difficult subject matters, really difficult ideas about what comes from
*  being animal.
*  But I reached the end of it with a real sense of joy.
*  I reached the end of it with a real appreciation for the whole body of a human being and the
*  extraordinary qualities that we have to be able to walk through the earth and care about
*  anything that we happen to see around us.
*  That is a really, really exceptional thing to come out of our animal nature.
*  And I guess that was my take home from the book.
*  I think it's a lovely place to end.
*  So as our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  Well, this was really tough because like most writers, I, I both read too much and I also
*  have the ambition to read more than I'm ever going to read.
*  But I got two books by very different female philosophers actually that I've recently
*  read and enjoyed.
*  The first one is Gillian Rose's book, Love's Work.
*  And it takes the idea of love, but from within her experience of approaching death.
*  I don't know, it's just one of those taught poetic philosophical books that it might not
*  reach large audiences, but it's all the more rich for that.
*  The second book is by Australian philosopher Danielle Selamager.
*  And it's called Summertime Reflections on a Vanishing Future.
*  It's a really beautiful, timely reflection on the way that the environmental crisis impacts
*  the lives of other species.
*  So in particular, she tells the story of two pigs that live with her and how they get caught
*  up in the bushfires of 2019 and 2020.
*  And it's incredibly moving, but it's also, it's a provocation for us to, I guess, to
*  recognize and care about the other animals that are going to be impacted by climate change.
*  And yeah, finally, I actually started out my career as a poet.
*  I still do kind of write, but rather quietly now.
*  But I really love to read it.
*  So I've been reading Lighthead by Terence Hayes.
*  And his poems, I guess they kind of spin together high art and formal technical innovation.
*  But I think what I really get from them is this kind of political punch that kicks in
*  and it takes the wind out of me.
*  He drops it into the poems unexpectedly and beautifully at just the right moment.
*  Yeah, they're really satisfying and rich.
*  So, yeah, that's my three.
*  Melanie Challenger, thank you very much.
*  It's been a pleasure. Thank you.
