# The Inflation Story Has Changed Dramatically. Paul Krugman Breaks It Down.
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFraI1hYdU0)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Go back eight months, six months, and the inflation news was really grim. Prices were
*  going up and up and up. The Fed was raising interest rates at a really rapid clip. A lot of
*  economists were warning about the possibility of stagflation, suggesting we needed to have a
*  deeply painful recession to get out of this. But in recent months, there's been a bit of a phase
*  change. In January, annual inflation slowed for the seventh straight month. Unemployment is at 3.4%.
*  It's the lowest level since 1969. We are not in a recession. That doesn't mean we're out of the
*  woods. Inflation is still uncomfortably high, and there's debate over what it will take to get it to
*  an acceptable level. But a lot of the doomsday scenarios that were being thrown around six
*  months ago or a year ago, they look increasingly unlikely. A so-called soft landing feels more
*  attainable today than before. So I want to have my colleague and Nobel Prize winning economist,
*  Paul Krugman, on to trace how the story has changed and what we've learned and what he's
*  seen from the data. There's another reason I want to bring him on, which is that inflation has
*  blocked out basically every other economic policy debate you can imagine for the past year. But
*  there's a lot else going on with Republicans and a possible debt ceiling crisis, with the Biden
*  administration's return to industrial policy, with the decoupling with China, the crackup of
*  globalization. There's a lot. And so I wanted to hear Paul on all of it. As always, my email,
*  Ezra Klein show at n-waytimes.com. Paul Krugman, always a pleasure. Always good to be on with you.
*  So we're talking here. It's February 14th, which people all over the country celebrate for the
*  release of the January consumer price index data. They give each other cards and chocolates. It's a
*  beautiful day. What did that data say? How did you interpret it? It was telling us not much that we
*  didn't already know. Pretty much consistent with the story. Lots of problems with data these days.
*  Difficult cases make bad law. Crazy economies make bad statistics. So it's really hard to judge
*  exactly what's going on. But the basic thing seems to be that inflation is down a lot,
*  but not down to the Fed's target. And nothing in the Valentine's Day data release changed that picture.
*  Sure. Tell me a bit about how the inflation story has changed. Give me sort of the change
*  over the three months, maybe before today's data came out. And then, you know, there's a little bit
*  again of a narrative correction with inflation hawks saying, see, this proves that we're not out
*  of the woods yet. So to tell me where things had moved recently, and then if you think this changes
*  it at all. Okay. So the big news is not actually this release, but a few days ago, the Bureau of
*  Labor Statistics updated its seasonal adjustments. Ooh, this is exciting. Yeah. It sounds like boring
*  as hell, but it turns out, unfortunately, to be crucial because normally, you know, in calmer times,
*  you can look at change over the previous year, in which case it's not a problem. You're comparing
*  month to month, but we've been in a situation where we think that the underlying state of the
*  economy is changing really rapidly. So you need to be looking at shorter periods. Everybody
*  understands that one month is not enough to draw conclusions, but a lot of people, me included,
*  have sort of looked at three months or six months rates of change. But those things depend a lot
*  on, you know, some prices go up and down depending on the weather, depending on the season,
*  is it Christmas or not? And the data that you see normally are not raw price numbers. They're
*  numbers adjusted for the usual annual pattern of prices, but that pattern changes over time as
*  well, and has changed probably quite a lot in the COVID era. So the Bureau of Labor Statistics updates
*  it and data update meant that what had been a really dramatic story of falling inflation over
*  the course of the second half of 2022 has now become only a pretty persuasive story. It's still
*  there, but numbers that look like, hey, we're home free, inflation is over, now look like, well,
*  about two thirds of the inflation surge seems to have gone away, but we're still pretty far above
*  where we want to be. There are a lot of different numbers being thrown around right now. You hear
*  about the super price index. There's what gets called core inflation. There's super core and
*  super duper core, those wages. What are the numbers? What are the indicators that you find
*  most useful right now for tracking the inflation picture? And the reverse of that, what are the
*  ones you don't find that useful that you think can be misleading at the moment? Usually at this point,
*  looking at super core, which is inflation taking out food, energy, shelter, and used cars, but
*  turns out the used car prices have been crazy enough to actually skew the data. And I look at
*  wages, but trying to look at, even that's got problems. Those are the numbers that I think are
*  the least likely to be giving you really false signals. We have a really big problem. A third
*  of the consumer price index is shelter and core inflation, which people have long used, I've long
*  used to assess some kind of underlying inflation, which takes out food and energy. That's 40%
*  shelter, but shelter prices are basically rents. Many people actually do rent the place they live
*  in. And even those who don't, the BLS imputes a rental number based upon what people who do rent
*  are paying. People typically rent for a year. And so at a measure of average rents, it's telling you
*  a lot about where the economy was a year ago, not where it is now. And that's created a crazy
*  situation. On the one hand, we know from a bunch of data, including some studies that the government
*  is doing, but also studies that information from private sources, we know that rents are flat or
*  falling on new rentals. And meanwhile, you have the official inflation numbers that came out today
*  saying that the cost of shelter is rising at almost 10% a year. And that's not wrong. That's
*  actually, if we look at what people are actually paying for apartments, that's probably on average,
*  that's probably about right because they're still getting their leases renewed at much higher rates.
*  But if we're asking whether the economy is running too hot, then as inflationary, that's crazy.
*  That's not in fact happening. Our great old standby core inflation has turned out to be a really,
*  misleading number at this point. One measure here that economists, as far as I can tell,
*  all seem to agree on the importance of is wages. Yeah. So why are wages so important as an indicator
*  of inflation and where it's going? And what does a wage data say to you over the past couple of months?
*  So wages are important really for two reasons. One is that they are an important part of costs and
*  other things equal. Favorite economist phrase, an increase in wages will tend to get passed on into
*  prices. Not always. And there are reasons to think that might not fully happen right now,
*  but it is important. But also labor is a very widely traded commodity. I know it's people,
*  but it's also got a market price. And so the level of wages is a pretty good indicator of
*  overall movements in the level of prices generally. And it's not wildly volatile like the price of oil
*  or eggs. So wages is kind of a pretty good indicator, except that if the mix of workers
*  changes, as it did during the pandemic when a lot of low wage service workers were laid off and then
*  rehired, wages become a problem as well. But various wage data, wages are rising faster than they were
*  pre-pandemic, but a lot slower than they were last winter. And depending upon your various
*  magic eight-ball calculations, wages are rising between one and two percentage points faster than
*  would be consistent with the Fed's inflation target, which kind of matches some of the other
*  data. So that's probably your best guess, but it's guess about where we are.
*  There's something, and I recognize this is not very economist of me,
*  but there's something very weird about watching so many democratic economists, people who spend
*  most of their time that I've known them thinking about how to get wages higher,
*  worrying every couple of months that the wage data is going to come in too high and we're going to
*  have overly high wages. I'm just curious as somebody who worries a lot about labor markets,
*  how the strange inversion of inflationary periods feels like this moment where high wages become
*  threatening as opposed to something to root for. Yeah, well, one of my, I think, verbal ticks is to
*  say economics is not a morality play, that things that regard as good in general aren't necessarily
*  good for the economic situation and vice versa. And I think it's great if we can have a period
*  during which wages are rising faster than prices. That doesn't stop me from saying, well, if I look
*  at the rate of wage increase out there, it does kind of point to an economy that is probably still
*  running too hot. I think it's perfectly reasonable to argue that we don't have to get wage growth
*  back down to the levels it was during the period of rapidly rising inequality. We can have faster
*  wage growth than that, but not probably as fast as what we're seeing right now. So one thing that I
*  saw in today's data, and particularly in the reaction to today's data, was it even after that
*  seasonal adjustment had happened, the new numbers seem to make people feel even less confident that
*  we were out of the woods. So Jason Furman, the former chair of the council of economic advisors,
*  who's been very, very on the inflation beat, he said the inflation picture that had started to look
*  better a month ago, it turns out that a lot of that was probably a false dawn. The whole perspective
*  we have on inflation is much worse. So that's a more radical downward revision in sentiment for
*  Jason that I'm hearing for you. How do you think about that? Yeah, I mean, maybe because I never
*  fully bought into the it's all over position because like Jason, I mean, I look at pretty
*  much the same numbers and often we've disagreed about some stuff, but basically that seasonal
*  adjustment change was a bit of a shocker. And there had been numbers out there before that could
*  be read to say it's all over, but never the wage numbers. The wage numbers never gave you that
*  answer. And so now that prop behind a complete victory celebration position has been knocked
*  away from us. But I actually did not see anything in today's numbers that really changed that. I
*  think it was the seasonal adjustment thing that said, you know, let's hold off a bit on the party.
*  One thing that has seemed true over the past couple of months is we're seeing more disinflation
*  with less economic cost than a lot of people had begun predicting and fearing, right? There's a lot
*  of talk of recession, a lot of talk of the amount of unemployment the Fed would need to create
*  in our get inflation down. Larry Summers have been saying that we would need five years of
*  unemployment above 5% to contain inflation, but it has been coming down quite a bit, even if not
*  maybe as much as people hoped unemployment is at 3.4%, which is quite low. We added a lot of jobs
*  in January. The employment inflation trade off has seemed to bite at least so far a little bit
*  less than a lot of people feared. Why do you think that is and do you think that continues?
*  Yeah, I would say it's not that it's a little bit less. It's a lot less. I mean, the fact that we've
*  seen, you know, whatever your preferred measure of inflation is, that it's come down a lot over
*  the past year with no rise in unemployment whatsoever, that's a pretty big deal. And
*  there are actually two possible explanations which are not mutually contradictory. One of them is that
*  the a lot of the, you know, teen transitory arguments that said all of this is pandemic
*  related disruptions and that as supply chains get unkinked and things normalized that we'll be seeing
*  inflation come down spontaneously. A lot of that was true. A lot of the inflation we were seeing
*  was in fact one time events, which were just much broader in scope than anyone had imagined.
*  I certainly didn't see a surge in rents, probably as a consequence of the explosion of work from home,
*  which in turn is, you know, was driven by the pandemic. I didn't see that coming. And yet that
*  had a huge impact on the inflation numbers. The other is that we haven't had an economy that's
*  been running this hot on a sustained basis for a long time. And most of what we thought we knew
*  about unemployment inflation trade-offs come from periods when the economy probably had a fair bit
*  of slack in it when it was operating below its capacity. And so a fair number of people had even
*  predicted in advance that the trade-offs would get much steeper so that when the economy overheated,
*  inflation went up much faster than people expected. But then as the economy probably,
*  at least spending, cooled off a bit, inflation came down much faster as well. So it's kind of
*  the combination of the craziness of the period plus we've been experimenting with running the
*  economy close to and maybe beyond full employment, which we haven't done for a very long time.
*  I remember talking to Biden administration economists early in the administration,
*  and they were saying to me then that the great experiment of this administration compared to
*  recent eras was they were going to try to run the economy hot. They were going to try to push a lot
*  of demand into it. They were going to try to get unemployment much lower. They were going to try to
*  get wages much higher. And they did. I mean, they really got it to run hot. And then there was a
*  period where the sense was this will be seen as the big mistake of the Biden administration.
*  They ran it too hot. They put too much stimulus in there. The Fed was too slow to act, which isn't
*  necessarily their fault, but nevertheless. And now we have this terrible inflation problem. It's
*  eating back the wage gains. It's going to force the Fed to throw the economy to recession.
*  Do you think maybe that sort of corrective judgment is now looking a bit wrong too? And
*  they deserve some real credit for taking the risk to run this hot. I mean, if we're able to get this
*  down and I don't want to unroll a mission accomplished banner here, but it's not an
*  insignificant thing that unemployment is 3.4%, not an insignificant thing that there's a tight
*  labor market. It does help people who've been left out for a very long time. I guess to wrap
*  this into a question, how do you see the Biden administration's macro economic policy record at
*  this juncture? Well, at this point, it's looking pretty good. It was not a happy thing that inflation
*  shot up to levels that people hadn't seen since the 1980s. That rattled people quite a lot,
*  but there's pretty much overwhelming evidence that that did not get entrenched, to use one of those
*  phrases, that people did not start building the expectation of inflation forever into their
*  decisions. So it was in fact a passing phase and find out whatever other synonyms you can look for
*  for transitory. It does in fact look transitory, although the transit took longer and was bigger
*  than people expected. And meanwhile, we have had a full recovery of the labor market far, far faster
*  than the last one. Instead of eight years of elevated unemployment, we've had two years of
*  elevated unemployment, not even. And it actually looks pretty good. A lot of the forecasts that
*  reasonable people are making suggest that inflation may well be a number with a two handle,
*  as you know, something under three by the end of this year. And unemployment will be something with
*  a three handle, probably under 4%. That's a win. We were hit with a massive, massive economic shock,
*  and we got back to full employment and we had a brief period in the rearview mirror,
*  a brief period of high inflation. That's pretty darn good. So the Fed is still having to manage
*  this very actively. What they are going to do is still somewhat uncertain. You know, wonderful
*  analogy for them or metaphor for them, where you said you often think of the Federal Reserve
*  as operating heavy machinery in a very dark room while wearing mittens. And I took the point of
*  that as they don't have the delicacy. They sort of have to turn the dials pretty hard oftentimes
*  in one direction or another, and they don't have all the information they would like to have.
*  So I want to ask about the Fed this way. If you're an advisor in Jerome Powell's ear,
*  making the case for him to err on the side of doing too much, and you're an advisor making the
*  case for him to err on the side of doing a bit less, how do you make those cases? What is your
*  hawk case? What is your dove case to him? Well, the hawk case is that this economy still looks
*  really hot. And you know, probably that 500,000 job gain that we just saw was not exactly real.
*  I mean, not that there was anything fake, but that it was probably not representative of how
*  hot the economy is running. But the economy is still looking like an economy that is running
*  sort of beyond full employment. What does that mean quickly for people who aren't used to hot
*  and full employment? What does it mean for an economy to be hot? Good question. The jargon does
*  tend to take over your brain no matter what you do. We know that the overall level of spending
*  in the economy determines basically what's going to happen. And if you have an increase in overall
*  spending, consumer spending, government spending, all kinds of spending, that that's going to lead
*  both to more jobs, more production, but also to higher prices. And the trade off, what fraction
*  of it leads to higher prices as opposed to more jobs is one of those big questions that keep on
*  revising our answers to. But there's clearly some kind of trade off there. And running the economy
*  too hot just basically means that we're spending is so high that we've gone beyond the point where
*  we're willing to accept the faster increase in prices in return for having a lot of jobs out
*  there. What makes it unacceptable is not so much even the fact that nobody likes inflation as the
*  fact that you do fear that if inflation stays high for a long time, that it will get entrenched in
*  the economy. And so you don't want that to happen. And so if I were trying to convince Powell to
*  keep hiking those rates, I'd say, look, we know that inflation expectations have stayed anchored
*  all through, but how much do you want to count on that happening? And look, the economy is still
*  going gangbusters. So since you're trying to slow it down, you haven't done enough. The reverse case
*  is, well, yeah, but inflation expectations are staying anchored. And we're not sure that the
*  economy will stay this strong. We may still be seeing some delayed effects of federal aid from
*  two years ago. It's not clear that there are some oddities about construction where housing starts
*  are down, but employment isn't. And there is a real risk that at some point, all of a sudden,
*  the effects of those rate hikes really kick in and the economy starts to go into a serious
*  downturn, a nosedive, although that's probably exaggerating it. And yet, if you ask which of
*  those guys am I, the answer is I'm probably neither, both and neither. It's a very, very hard
*  call to make because the situation is very confusing. You've critiqued the inflation indicators
*  the Fed and Powell prefer to look at. Tell me which ones they seem to like and why you're not
*  convinced those are the ones to follow. Well, they've chosen. I mean, there is this, so, you
*  know, we now have this range. We used to just have inflation and core inflation. And in my day,
*  inflation indicators were simple. That's right. Now, the Fed has settled on core services, ex-housing,
*  and which is they are claiming as a measure of underlying labor cost pressure.
*  And is that an industry focused on service sector? Yes, it's all services. Obviously, there's goods.
*  There's stuff that you can put your hand on, and there's services, which is somebody doing something
*  for you. And our economy is mostly services rather than goods. We had normally, they tend to move in
*  tandem. Normally, goods tend to get cheaper over time relative to services, but at a consistent pace.
*  But the pandemic did crazy stuff. All of a sudden, people couldn't eat out, so they bought kitchen
*  equipment. They couldn't go to the gym, so they bought pelotons. And so we had this crunch on the
*  supply of goods. Goods prices went soaring. Now goods prices are coming back down to Earth. And so
*  if you're looking at goods prices, it looks like we're into rapid disinflation, maybe even actually
*  falling prices. But services are still rising. But then part of that is one of the services is the
*  services provided by housing, which we now know is lagging far behind what's really going on in the
*  rental market. And so you end up with this services excluding shelter and then trying to
*  exclude some of the stuff that involves energy as well. And it's a pretty narrow category.
*  And the more you restrict the set, the more what's left is starting to be stuff that is possibly
*  measured with error. All of this thing, one of the unimportant, but one of the costs of this whole
*  episode for people like me has been I'm learning much more than I ever wanted to about how price
*  indices are constructed. And there's a lot more necessary, basically educated guesswork
*  than you'd like. And the narrower you make your index, the more guesswork there is. So that's one
*  problem with it. The other is it is kind of funny that the Fed is looking at pretty much the only
*  indicator that isn't showing a lot of disinflation. And you have to wonder, shouldn't we at least be
*  looking at an array of things? And if nine out of 10 show that inflation is coming down, should we
*  be relying too much on the 10th, which doesn't agree with all of the others kind of a minority
*  report approach to inflation? And there's one more thing, which is that the White House, the Council
*  of Economic Advisers said, okay, you know, if this is supposed to be an indicator of weight pressure,
*  let's go and directly measure what's happening to wages in this sector that the Fed is focusing on,
*  which they've done. And it is showing disinflation. It's still showing wages rising faster than
*  they were before the pandemic, but it's not showing the kind of, it is showing progress.
*  So they're saying, you know, the Fed has chosen an indirect measure, but we can measure it directly.
*  And the direct measure looks kind of okay. I understand that one of the reasons they like
*  that measure is a fear that the nature of inflation is shifting, that a year ago it was goods
*  and used cars and things like that. And as those prices come down and supply chains have unkinked,
*  now it's moving over to the service sector. And that the secondary fear is that that's a lot harder
*  to bring down that inflicting a lot of economic pain because of how much of the service sector's
*  cost is really wages and labor and people. Do you think that's true? I mean, do they have a
*  first point because that's where it is now? And second, if that is where it is now,
*  does that make the job harder? Well, I think that that is, you know, inflation is now a
*  service sector issue, not a good sector issue. And there's good reason to believe that wages are
*  stickier. The cost of a worker is much less volatile than the cost of a shipping container.
*  But as for saying that, if that's your concern, why not just look at wages? So I am a little bit
*  puzzled that the Fed has chosen to go this route. I understand their concern, but it does seem like
*  they're trying a really kind of a Rube Goldberg device approach to something that you could just
*  try to measure directly. So I'm a little bit puzzled. I'm not quite sure. I have an enormous
*  regard for the Fed and the staff at the Fed in particular are terrific. But they do have
*  this feeling that's, look, people like me who were excessively optimistic, but even at other
*  times when we were actually right, have always been accused of searching through inflation measures
*  and finding the ones that throw out the inflation. Now there's this slight feel that the Fed is
*  searching through inflation measures and finding the one that throws out the disinflation. It does
*  seem a little odd that they've managed to hit the one measure out of this large array of possible
*  measures that is not showing any reason for optimism. So we've talked a bit here about the
*  idea of inflation being above the Fed's target. The target is 2%. There's a view, I think you
*  hold this view too, that getting inflation down from 9 to 6, that's easier than getting it down
*  from 6 to 3, but we look pretty likely to be able to get down to 4, 3. Getting it down that last
*  mile to 2 might be a really big deal and or might cause a lot of suffering is more what I'm saying
*  there, not to be euphemistic. Why 2%, why should 2% rather than 3% even be the goal?
*  Yeah, you know, I've spent a lot of time on this issue from way back and it's one of the few things
*  out there where you really can say that it's New Zealand's fault because New Zealand was the first
*  central bank to explicitly introduce an inflation target and they said it at 0 to 2%. So 2%
*  was the New Zealand contribution to the debate. But more to the point, 2% long ago, 2% seemed like a
*  perfect compromise between opposing factions. There were people who wanted true price stability
*  because they thought prices should be stable, money should be, you have stable purchasing power,
*  and there were people who were worried that in the face of a severe recession,
*  interest rates might drop to zero and that wouldn't be low enough and that we would need,
*  it would be less likely that we would hit that zero lower bound if inflation was positive.
*  And circa 1999, which is more or less when all of this gelled, it appeared both that
*  you could make the case that 2% inflation was really zero if you included technological
*  progress and quality change. What value did you place on being able to watch TikToks? And 2% kind
*  of satisfied the stable price people. And on the other side, it looked, given the modeling at the
*  time, as if 2% was high enough that being unable to reduce interest rates below zero
*  would ever be a serious problem. But of course, that's a long time ago and that second proposition
*  turned out to be totally wrong. We spent most of the time between the 2008 financial crisis
*  and the pandemic with interest rates at zero. So in a way, what we've had is this orthodoxy congealed
*  around 2% that was based upon reasonable analysis 25 years ago, but not based on what we now know
*  to be, what we now believe to be the truth. So I've raised this, I've been in meetings,
*  including closed door meetings full of people in suits. And you say, you make the intellectual
*  case for three, actually making more sense given the data and given what we've experienced then too.
*  And people get absolutely bonkers at the notion. I think part of it is the fear, somehow, that if you
*  loosen up a bit, if you change the target, then suddenly the 1970s will come back, that then people
*  will in fact start to believe, well, if it can go from two to three, then why not three to five and
*  five to 10? And I don't think it's reasonable, but that's a fear that really weighs on people's minds.
*  How much of that do you think is economics and how much of that goes to what you described as
*  your verbal tick, which is a tendency of many to treat economics in general, but I think
*  particularly inflation as a morality play. I think that's a really important thing. I think it's
*  a funny thing. If you talk to central bankers, I don't actually talk to Jerome Powell, but if you
*  talk to people who are in this position, many of them in their sort of Walter Mitty fantasies,
*  they see themselves as the next Paul Volcker, the strong, tough man who cured inflation.
*  And very few, I think, see themselves as the next Ben Bernanke, the guy whose willingness to
*  break with orthodoxy and pour money into the system saved the world from a second great
*  depression. And it's a funny thing. Actually, if you want to ask me who was the greatest central
*  banker in history, I would actually probably say Mario Draghi, who saved the euro. And he saved
*  the euro by being willing to do more, by being willing to be less tough. But if you ask central
*  bankers, I'm sure that most of them would answer Paul Volcker. So there is this sense that you're
*  put in this position to be willing to impose pain, not by being willing to go easy on people.
*  And so to go back to that question of what's wrong with three, in a recent interview, Jason
*  Furman, who I trust and respect for and has been on the show a number of times, he said, quote,
*  the most likely outcome is what I'd call continued overheating. The unemployment rate never rises
*  above 4.5%. The inflation rate on a sustained basis never falls below 3%. And so we're still
*  grappling with this problem at the end of the year. If those were the numbers at the end of 2023,
*  would you agree that we are grappling with a problem or that we've reached a good steady state?
*  I actually very much doubt that we're going to have unemployment of 4.5. But take the generic,
*  take the qualitative thing where unemployment is low, the economy is still running pretty hot,
*  but inflation is running at 3%. I would think that there would be a pretty good case for
*  calling that a win. Jason's a lot younger than I am. I remember the late 1980s. I remember
*  Ronald Reagan after he declared mourning in America. We had 4% inflation at that point.
*  And nobody walked around saying, oh my God, it's terrible. We have 4% inflation. People sort of
*  thought that was kind of okay. So I don't actually think it's a really bad thing unless we see really
*  good reason to believe that we're going to start to develop that stagflationary cycle that so far
*  has been completely absent. I don't think it's a terrible thing.
*  So I want to take a step back now from inflation, which I think has had this quality of blotting
*  out the entire sun of other economic policy questions for about a year. We seem to be barreling
*  towards debt ceiling crisis again for those of us around in 2011. It's funny because I used to talk
*  to this guy, Jay Powell at the Bipartisan Policy Center about the debt ceiling all the time back
*  in 2010 and 2011. He was just this economic policy wonk. He knew all about how to prioritize payments
*  and now he's a federal reserve chair. It's weird how things work. But so there can be this feeling
*  of rerunning it. It's like the same players in some ways and Republicans just took the House.
*  But you've argued that this is actually quite different because the Republican Party itself
*  has changed so much over the last decade. And so what they're trying to do, if anything at all,
*  has changed quite dramatically. So tell me how you contrast the debt ceiling fight of 2011
*  from the debt ceiling fight we seem to be headed towards now.
*  Yeah, there are actually several ways in which this is quite different,
*  which doesn't mean that I know how it's going to turn out. But the first thing is, yeah,
*  Republican Party in 2011, it was more or less in terms of economic policy, it was Paul Ryan's party.
*  And so what the Republican Party wanted was or the demands they were trying to place were basically
*  cut Medicare and Social Security, which now they're screaming that that's not what they want. So
*  it's going to be a little bit hard for them to try and make that a negotiating demand.
*  Although in fact, it is what they want, but it's not top of their list. They're much more
*  at the culture war than any of this stuff now. And they're also fragmented. You know, if I negotiate
*  with the Republican Party, it's been like the old question, if I want to talk to Europe, who do I call?
*  I mean, yes, there is a Speaker of the House, but nobody actually thinks that he has the ability to
*  tell his members what to do. So it's not even clear who you're negotiating with if you try.
*  So Republicans are very different. They're really now very much more a culture war party than they
*  are a small government ID, economic ideology party. The Democrats are different. Democrats are
*  a lot tougher about this very many fewer Democrats with illusions that if we can just get through this
*  one thing, we can go back to bipartisan governing. There must be somebody in the Senate who still
*  believes that, but I don't think there's any senior people in the Biden administration who
*  believe that. And there's a broader environment. There's kind of, I used to talk about the very
*  serious people all in caps. There was in 2011, everybody in Washington was all obsessed with
*  deficits. As you yourself wrote, there seemed to be a rule that on all other issues, reporters had
*  to at least pretend to be neutral, but to be anti-deficit that was considered to be
*  something you could say in what was supposedly objective reporting. Now, it's not nearly that
*  much out there. That whole complex of deficit hawks and or deficit skulls still kind of exists,
*  but it's a shadow of its former self. So we're in a situation now where there is no consensus
*  that social security and Medicare should be cut. Democrats have no desire to
*  or belief in making a compromise with Republicans and Republicans really don't know what they want.
*  So it's, it, although the mechanics look the same, you know, the surrounding context is
*  completely different. Do you have an answer to the question? What is the Republican Party's economic
*  agenda at this point? No, because I don't think they have one. I mean, it, it, as I think of it,
*  the leading voices, the people with real political clout now, for the most part, certainly in the
*  house are culture warriors, ideologues, a lot of white nationalism, but anyway, the, whatever it
*  is that they care about, it's, they don't really much care about economics at all. A lot of the
*  kind of staff, a lot of the people, you know, if they say, write me a bill, the people who are
*  assigned to do that, a lot of them basically grew up inside the hothouse environment of right wing
*  think tanks where they've absorbed all of this magic of tax cuts, evil of government spending
*  ideology. But that's almost more of a instinctive reflex than it is a party ideology at this point.
*  So God knows. I mean, if, if you were to ask what does Marjorie Taylor Greene
*  believe constitutes good economic policy, does she even know that? I, I just find it very hard
*  to figure out what the point is. I thought it was very striking that the big moment of controversy
*  out of the state of the union was that Biden said Republicans want to cut sunset, eliminate
*  social security, et cetera. And Republicans booed at that and felt very offended. Kevin McCarthy,
*  in the utter opposite of the kind of thing Paul Ryan did, has said that cuts to social security
*  and Medicare are off the table. Mitch McConnell was clearly very unhappy with Senator Rick Scott's
*  big budget proposal that was full of entitlement cuts and full of things that are scary to
*  median voters. That at the same time, they don't have much of an economic policy. They've quite
*  run away from a lot of what seemed to be the core of what they all said they wanted in 2011.
*  Yeah, this is representing, well, it's a lot of time has gone by. It's a very, very different
*  cast of characters, except for Mitch McConnell is still there. But it's just people who make a point
*  of becoming Republican candidates, people who are running are not doing it because they want to
*  implement, let's say, fair economic policies. They have a variety of motivations and I'm sure
*  you're talking to other people about all of that, but this just isn't top of the agenda and
*  they don't really have a philosophy anymore. You wrote an interesting piece about this. I think
*  it was called something like, we're going to miss the era of greed and insincerity. I might have it
*  wrong from memory, but you make a very interesting point in it that I think is true, which is that
*  for quite a long time, the theory that many people have of the Republican Party was that
*  the culture war side of it was a little bit fake. They might believe, but they didn't really care
*  about it and they were just using it to cut taxes for rich people and deregulate and so on.
*  And that now, if anything, it often seems to be the reverse. If you think about the Trumpist
*  Republican Party, a lot of the figures who seem to be rising the Republican Party, they'll say
*  almost anything on economics. What they really care about is whether or not critical race theory
*  is taught in schools and which books are in the library and whether or not drag queens get to do
*  story hour. And the culture war increasingly seems to be the beating heart and there's more
*  opportunism on economics in the hopes that you can get into power to vanquish wokeness.
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that the theory of the Republican Party as basically the
*  plutocrats using culture war and then putting them back in the closet after the election,
*  that was a pretty valid picture of the party 20 years ago. I mean, that was the 2004 election
*  and Bush wins the election, as I like to say, by running as the defender of America against gay
*  married terrorists and then says, and now I'm going to privatize social security. But what
*  happened is that the people who thought they were using the culture warriors found out that in the
*  end, at this point, they're the ones being used. They're not in charge anymore. And now one thing
*  that is a little surprising, we'll say, is that we haven't seen more of the culture warriors being
*  willing to go the whole way and start advocating genuine economic populism. I mean, one of the
*  things that one might have expected or depending on your politics, I guess, feared would be that
*  they would do something like a little bit like the former national front in France,
*  forgetting what they call themselves now, but Marine Le Pen, that they would be actually
*  advocating a strong welfare state, but only for the right kind of people.
*  Here in folk welfare state, people sometimes say that why don't they just give up on this whole
*  let's cut social security and Medicare thing and ditch these extremely unpopular right wing
*  economic policies. There are reasons for that, among other things, they still want the money
*  from the billionaires. But it is remarkable how little the things that we used to think the
*  Republican Party was all about are seem to be hard to even on their scopes these days.
*  I think this gets to the reverse of something you were saying a minute ago, which is that
*  what economic policy does Marjorie Taylor Greene have? Not much of one. And the reason we bring
*  her up is that she controls a lot of attention in the party. There is clearly a lot of energy
*  from this Trumpist social media oriented side. But if you go look at who runs committees in the
*  Republican House, who's running energy and commerce and ways and means and finance and so on,
*  it's not all the newest most Trumpy figures. So some of them might, JD Vance's and so on,
*  some of them might have, I don't exactly want to call it populist, but they might be willing
*  or interested in doing different things on economic policy. But whatever they control
*  in terms of attention, they don't still control the governing levers of the party. I mean,
*  I think something that is really still quite underrated about the Republican Party is whatever
*  the allegiance it has to Donald Trump, it remains very much in its congressional wing, this
*  party in transition. I mean, Trump comes in, it's still Paul Ryan's party in the House. So they end
*  up trying to repeal Obamacare. They end up passing these very unpopular tax cuts. Trump ends up yoked
*  to some degree to the Ryan agenda. And now it's moved much more towards him. But first,
*  he's very incoherent himself. But second, it hasn't lost that whole side of the party. It just,
*  there isn't unity in the party. It can't want anything because it isn't even less so than normal
*  parties. I think at this point, it isn't one thing. I almost blanch calling it a party at all. I don't
*  think it acts like a party. I don't think it has the internal coherence to make decisions.
*  And so this is weird thing where the sort of attention getters really matter, but they can't
*  pass anything. The people who run the parts that pass things, they're not connected to the core of
*  the base anymore. It's just a very weird structure that I think is going to create a whole lot of
*  governing problems. Because as you were saying, there's nobody to call who can actually control
*  it. Yeah. And one of the things is that this is partly what happened to Trump as well,
*  is that actually turning your ideology or preferences or prejudices or whatever into policy
*  is not a trivial matter. There's a lot of just plain detailed grunt work that's involved. I mean,
*  if you actually read Robert Caro's great biography of Robert Moses, Moses first established
*  his reputation as being the best drafter of legislation in Albany. He knew how to write a
*  bill that would make something happen in ways that people didn't understand, but he did.
*  And if you ask who among this current crop of, I mean, among the Fox News class of Republicans,
*  who among them has any idea how to write a bill? The answer I would assume, basically none of them.
*  The people who do to the extent that anybody in the Republican Party knows how to do that. Now,
*  they're probably people who basically came up the Paul Ryan route. They came up through the
*  right-wing think tanks and all of that. But it does mean that there's no real coherent
*  message. There's no coherent policy goal, just a lot of free-floating hostility.
*  Let's talk about that question of writing a bill that does what it says on the 10. So if you look
*  back over the past couple of years of the Biden administration, they've passed a series of big
*  bills that among other things, a lot of people I think correctly have heralded as a return of
*  what gets called industrial policy, the government getting interested in supporting, fostering,
*  nurturing particular domestic industries. And one of the specific things these bills try to do
*  is using both carrots and sticks, locate and build very advanced manufacturing chains in the US.
*  We're trying to onshore a semiconductor manufacturing, onshore a lot of the electric
*  vehicle production process, onshore a lot of the battery production process. We're investing a lot
*  of money in that. We have these various buy American provisions, which could slow down some
*  of the adoption of things we really care about. But the hope on the Biden administration side is
*  that it will actually lead to us building these industries. How do you think about that? Do you
*  think we're going to be able to do this? Well, I think we will be able to make it happen.
*  Whether it will actually be efficient, whether the industrial policy aspects are going to
*  make GDP grow faster is very much up in the air. We really don't know that. But in a way, that's
*  a hope, but it's not the point. Above all, the Inflation Reduction Act is another one of those,
*  you know, the name has absolutely nothing to do with what it's really about. It's primarily a
*  climate change bill, but it tries to fight climate change through industrial policy,
*  not because the drafters necessarily believe that industrial policy was the best way to do it,
*  but because they thought that was the politically feasible way to do it. Because by using carrots
*  rather than sticks, by saying, here's a tax credit for buying energy efficient stuff made in America,
*  rather than saying we're going to tax your carbon emissions, that they had basically the only way
*  that you could get major legislation passed. And I'm not terribly afraid. I mean, there's some
*  people who look at industrial policy and say, oh my God, inefficiency, it'll hurt the economy.
*  Yeah, maybe not. Unlikely to be actually even within the measurement error in terms of the
*  GDP growth rate. What it does do is it makes it politically possible to do things that we
*  really do need to do, like fight climate change. Well, for the sake of argument here, let me take
*  the other side of this, which, and not the other side from the conservative perspective, but from
*  the liberal perspective. If you listen to environmental scientists and climate scientists,
*  and I do, they say, we got to do this really quick. The decarbonization timeline to take
*  as the example is unbelievably short. We need to be inventing, manufacturing, deploying,
*  distributing, and using this stuff at a speed and a scale unlike anything since the construction of
*  the highway system. And I don't particularly care about a tenth of a point on GDP from these
*  measures. But I think the concern that people legitimately have is that they will slow down
*  adoption, that we are not going to be able to do this that fast. Losing five years on this stuff,
*  or slowing things down when we need them to come out really quickly really does matter.
*  And say China is very, very good at creating solar panels and wind turbines and so on at this point.
*  And China's got its problems, but climate change is also a very big problem. So take it off of the
*  question of GDP. I think there's a concern, there's like one hand of the democratic policy body
*  that is all about moving faster. And then another, like the other hand, is layering on all these
*  standards and ideas about politics, which maybe are good, but are going to slow things down.
*  And when we keep being told speed is of the essence and then keep being told, well,
*  it's worth it to make this trade off for speed, there's at least some tension there.
*  Yeah, although I don't think speed is really going to be the issue. I don't believe that we're going
*  to lose a lot of time by having, particularly by American provisions, will delay things maybe.
*  I'm not even sure it'll significantly delay, say, the electrification of transportation.
*  And the shift to renewables, I'm not sure it'll delay it at all. It'll make it more expensive,
*  probably get less bang for the buck in terms of decarbonization. It's a miracle that we got this
*  at all. Just a few months before the midterm elections, it looked like the whole agenda had
*  collapsed. There was going to be nothing, no major action on climate change. And then miraculously,
*  we get something that at least the environmental modelers I talk to, they're kind of over the
*  moon. They think that effectively Biden got 80% of what he was aiming for in terms of climate
*  change policy. And if he did so at the cost of some inefficiency, well, okay, that's unfortunate.
*  But it looks to me as if political reality is reality. And given the political reality,
*  we actually did remarkably well on all of this. Well, I agree, given the political reality. And
*  I don't want to take the other side of this because I think the IRA is an unbelievable
*  achievement. And I was so deeply relieved when it passed. But there's a question of political
*  reality and there's a question of climate reality, I think. And the thing that has been on my mind a
*  lot talking to, I think, presumably the same modelers you talk to, like people like Jesse
*  Jenkins and others who've been very involved in the climate fight, is they're all terrified,
*  as best I can tell, about deployment. And I've been trying to dig in more in my own reporting
*  on what it takes to get a next generation energy project built, or for that matter, I'm in California,
*  just what it takes to get a house built. And it's tough. You really do see things get slowed down
*  for a year or years. I've reported a bit on congestion pricing in New York. And that's been
*  held up. And now it's moving forward, I think. But it really spent a lot of time in environmental
*  review for what's very much a pro-environment policy. And so one of my big themes has been
*  this idea of the supply side and how that interacts with liberal values. Because I think that
*  oftentimes, Democrats and liberals underestimate how much constraints on supply
*  actually end up foiling or slowing down or reversing things that are intended to achieve
*  both progressive but more to the point good and just ends.
*  Yeah. But that's really not an industrial policy or a bi-American policy question. It's a question
*  of how much we're going to allow regulatory snarls, nimbism in the broad sense to hold things up.
*  And this is a place where we'll see what happens, but there will probably be some cases where it's
*  going to be really important to yell at people who think that they're progressives, but in the name
*  of saving some notion of a place's character. I'm sounding like I sneer at that, but that's
*  real. But there are things that are more important and saving the planet from catastrophe is more
*  important than that. And we do kind of need a bit of a wartime mentality where you have to be willing
*  to take some risks of some things that you don't want to see happening in order to get this stuff
*  rolled out. And so sure, in a way, that's almost a case for industrial policy. It's saying that
*  if you just provide price incentives, well, then you're going to get people
*  coming up with all kinds of reasons why you can't do things. And if you say,
*  we have a federal backed project that is going to build a green energy facility here,
*  and we are going to bring the full political weight of the president of the United States
*  on you to make sure that you don't stop it from happening, it may be more likely to get things done.
*  I wrote this piece on construction productivity that you had a thought an interesting response to.
*  Do you want to talk a bit about how you understand the construction productivity
*  puzzle or state of play and some of the arguments you're making there?
*  Okay. Now, construction really is strikingly inefficient in the United States. I mean, so
*  even leaving aside the question of whether it's really true that we've had no productivity
*  increase for half a century, which I don't think is fully plausible, even though that's what the
*  numbers say, we do know that from place of things that we can measure, we know that it's immensely
*  slower and more expensive to say construct a mile of mass transit in the United States.
*  So we have a real problem. We have somehow created in the land that's supposed to be the
*  land of the free market, we've created a situation where building stuff has many, many obstacles.
*  And it's amazingly easy for really quite narrow self-interest groups to block it. And
*  addressing that is really, really important. There's a danger. I was just struck because I
*  happened to remember the productivity debates in the 70s when productivity growth slowed down
*  abruptly more or less as we began having significant safety and environmental regulation.
*  And there, it was important to note that actually we got a lot in terms of reduced
*  workplace injuries and improved environment out of those regulations, even if they weren't perfect.
*  But there's clearly a lot of, you don't have to be a complete regulation is bad guy to think that we
*  have problems of regulations. On the other hand, you don't have to be a complete regulation is
*  always a mistake person to take the opposite position. Clearly, we have a construction problem
*  in America. In a way, I very much doubt that it is really the case that we've made no productivity
*  gains at all in construction. It just kind of defies perceptions. And if you, to some extent,
*  if the data are telling you something that really conflicts with what you think you see with your
*  naked eye, or you might really want to ask about the data, but clearly we do have a problem.
*  And that should be the issue. One of the really interesting conversations I had in that piece was
*  with this guy, Ed Zurensky, who has been in construction for almost 40 years. Now he's a
*  sort of consultant and analyst. He's an estimator. He's worked on a lot of job sites. And he was
*  saying sort of to the point you're making that when he started in the 70s, the safety regulations
*  on the job site were almost unnoticeable. And now they're quite profound. And that's a place where
*  I think if it slows things down, it's probably very much for the good. On the other hand,
*  it's pushed me back and I be curious how you think about him because he's such an important
*  figure in your field. It pushed me back to thinking about this book by Mansour Olsen on
*  The Rise and Decline of Nations, which I don't think is a book that's correct in every respect.
*  And I think that it spends way too much time assuming everybody's selfishly trying to get
*  their piece of the pie and get money for themselves. But a lot of our growth as a country
*  in recent decades has been in places where you don't have to ask them any permissions before
*  doing something. I mean, sometimes worryingly so. Finance, the internet. And when you get into
*  areas where you are dealing with a lot of different stakeholders in any one project,
*  and construction is I think a really good example of that. I mean, to build something,
*  you've got neighbors, you've got emergency access vehicles, you've got safety regulators,
*  you've got people who don't like the noise, you've got a million players. And I think the Mansour
*  Olsen take on a lot of things for us, but also in maybe other advanced nations, is that as
*  countries get really stable and really rich, they develop all these different groups who,
*  for reasons that are sometimes really good and sometimes bad, are able to have their say and just
*  everything slows down. And I think his view is almost as irreversible without some kind of crisis,
*  which I don't think is my view, but I'm curious how you take his work because he's in your field.
*  He's just somebody I've been enjoying reading. You know, Olsen's book, they're actually the biggest
*  single insight from his book is that political action in general, you know, it's a public good
*  that there where people can free ride on other people. So you can have bad outcomes because
*  even though some policy choices are very much in the, you know, against the interest of the general
*  public, no one person has much incentive to organize against it. And on the other hand,
*  there may be some quite small interest group that makes, you know, dominates back in the days when
*  used to be the kind of thing I worried about. We used to talk about the U.S. had sugar import quotas
*  that raised the cost of food for everybody. Sugar was two or three times as expensive in the United
*  States as was on the world market, but nobody knew that because sugar is an all pervasive ingredient
*  and you never see it. On the other hand, there were really a handful of sugar cane growers in
*  the United States and they were the ones who had the lobbying power. So that was a powerful insight
*  and the idea that it can be a restraint on growth, I think also maybe a may have been just too cosmic
*  in it. It kind of, it was kind of generic and lacking in specifics, but as it happens, the whole
*  housing construction area is one where you can really see that happening. If we ask where in America
*  do workers seem to be most productive? Where do we seem to, you know, do people seem to produce
*  the most? Be most, where workers are most needed and they tend to be in the Bay Area, they tend to
*  be in New York. They tend not always, but by and large, the most productive places are places where
*  you have a big concentration of technology and knowledge, which also for the most part are places
*  that make it almost impossible to build housing so that people who should be
*  productively employed in those places end up moving someplace else, being less productive
*  because they can afford a house. And when you try to put numbers to what that costs, people have done
*  that and they're quite large. The U.S. is probably, I mean, I've seen numbers as high as 10%
*  poorer than it would be if we didn't have this basically nimbus, if we didn't prevent housing
*  construction in places where there's actually really strong demand for workers. A lot of the work that
*  you won the Nobel for is in trade economics and we've had a, I think, a pretty big shift
*  in the politics around trade and not just where Republicans are on it, but where Democrats are.
*  There is on and off talk of decoupling with China. Certainly, I think, a sense that China policy
*  over the last few decades was too liberal and too optimistic. How would you say
*  attitudes towards trade in economics and in politics have changed and are you comfortable
*  with the changes? I'm never comfortable with anything.
*  But look, we have an economic theory which says free trade is by and large good
*  and it's a good theory and it's very insightful. We tend to make too much of it. Economists
*  tend to celebrate free trade more than their own models say they should because it's an insight
*  that economists have that the general public does not and so we make a big deal out of it more so.
*  The inefficiencies caused by protectionism get far more attention than the inefficiencies
*  caused by dysfunctional healthcare policy and yet healthcare policy is a much, much bigger
*  source of inefficiency in the economy than protectionism is. So in some sense, we're
*  kind of coming off the high of being all hyped on the virtues of trade. We also had a political
*  theory which was that commerce bred peace. In particular, with the breakup of the communist
*  world, there was a lot of hope that integrating former communist countries into the world economy
*  would push them towards becoming democratic good citizens of the world. And what's happened now is
*  that we have had some rude awakenings. We've learned that countries can become deeply integrated
*  in the world economy and get a lot richer and still remain authoritarian and not bring in
*  western values along with western technology. And especially between China's backsliding,
*  China's becoming more authoritarian over time and now it turns out that the era of aggressive wars
*  of conquest isn't over either. I think a lot of people are willing to say, okay,
*  there's still a lot to be said for global commerce, but defending the openness of
*  world markets has moved down several rungs on our list of priorities.
*  We seem to be in an era of pretty intense weaponization of economic policy. You think
*  about the sanctions regime that we've encircled Russia with. You think of not just the trade stuff
*  that Trump is doing with China, which Joe Biden has mostly kept, but Biden's escalation into
*  trying to lock them out of some advanced semiconductor trade and materials and manufacturing
*  and a sort of clear view that we should try to slow their technological progress on certain
*  frontiers. How is that read to you? Do you think these are good moves and they make sense given
*  the geopolitical context? Do you think that they are sort of washing in, falling into a new Cold War
*  mentality that isn't for the best? How's that all sat with you? So the stuff that Biden is doing
*  is very serious. We are explicitly trying to hobble to technological development of a rival power.
*  That is very, very serious stuff. That is something I don't think we've seen. It is the
*  Cold War. It is going back to trying to prevent technology transfer to the Soviet bloc. And
*  I think it makes sense, unfortunately. The dangers are real. Actually, a funny story. So, you know,
*  I spent a year in the US government in the Reagan administration, which is hard to believe in
*  8283, but you know, sub-political staff level, the guy behind the table passing up notes to his
*  principal. And I sat in on a debate, cabinet level debate about what can we do to stop the
*  Europeans from building gas pipelines to Russia? Because the US view was that that would be
*  dangerous. It would create strategic vulnerability. And basically the answer is we couldn't figure out
*  a way to stop them from doing it. But you know what? People who were worried about that were
*  right. In the end, it turns out that becoming dependent on Russian gas was a genuine security
*  risk to Western Europe. It took a long time for that particular bomb to go off, but it turns out
*  to be real. So we now know that these national security concerns are real. We know that the age
*  of aggressive governments, authoritarian regimes that pose a threat to the world order is not over.
*  So yeah, it's tough stuff. It makes me very nervous, but I don't think we can go back to
*  the kind of innocence that a lot of people had as late as the Obama years. I think you go back in
*  time a year, 18 months, there is a sense of China's being this inevitably rising power.
*  They have the zero COVID policy, their economy is weathering lockdown pretty well. They have all this
*  manufacturing prowess increasingly everybody else is jealous of. It feels like they are rising and
*  we're fading. And a lot of that seems to have reversed in a pretty compressed period of time.
*  And you've written a few things about the aura of China's inevitability shattering. Tell me about
*  how your assessments of China's arc have changed. Okay. I mean, the fundamental fact about China is
*  that they are obviously, they're human beings with all of the usual human capacities and have
*  in fact shown a lot of flair for entrepreneurship, for industrial development and the rise of the
*  Chinese economy is one of the great economic miracles of history. And there are a lot of Chinese.
*  So they don't have to be as good at anything as the West to become the world's biggest power.
*  So that was kind of the case for China. But at this point, it turns out that authoritarian
*  governments can move very effectively, but they can also make very big mistakes because nobody
*  can tell the leader that he's getting it wrong. It turns out that there are a fair number of
*  indications that China is falling into what some economists call the middle income trap,
*  that you can develop very rapidly up to a point, but getting beyond that point is not that easy,
*  that the full transition to becoming a complete first world economy is something that only a
*  handful of countries have actually managed. And it's starting to look like China may not be one of
*  them. And of course, although there are a lot of Chinese, the working age population has been
*  declining. So the inevitability of Chinese dominance, well, it doesn't look very inevitable
*  anymore. It's way too early to know. But it is starting to have a feel that this is a little bit
*  like Japan, early 90s, when everybody knew that Japan was going to take over the world and they
*  didn't. And so China is much bigger than Japan, but it's also has never actually achieved anything
*  like Japanese levels of productivity. So maybe not. Do you at this point think of AI as being
*  a potential significant economic shock for good or for ill? Or do you think that people are missing
*  something about how it'll interact with the economy? No, I think it's quite possibly a
*  significant economic shock. There's a lot of white collar employment involves things that could
*  plausibly be taken over by, you know, we're all calling it AI. It's not entirely clear
*  that it really is. Well, I hope we can argue definitions, but certainly the kinds of things
*  that we're now seeing. And this has been happening, by the way, for a while. It's been lower key, but
*  we've been seeing a lot of creeping mechanization of things that used to think only human beings
*  could do. And now it's really accelerating as highly visible and it could possibly displace
*  quite a lot of jobs. It's fine when I see people who are worried about this described as Luddites.
*  The Luddites were actually mostly skilled workers. They were weavers who suddenly found their skills
*  devalued by the development of the power loom. And they weren't wrong to feel that machinery was
*  hurting them. And it's not hard to imagine that this could happen to a lot of people.
*  On the other hand, if you've been in this economics business for a long time,
*  there have been multiple times when people made predictions that everything's about to change that
*  hasn't happened. So I think we just have to reserve judgment on this one. The thing that that brings
*  up for me is this seems like a real moment where the technology is moving very fast and the policy
*  conversation, the extent that there is any at all, is very slow. And you obviously want to be
*  careful about trying to think about policy for technologies that we still don't really understand.
*  But if you were thinking about areas of policy to think about in a world where maybe, you know,
*  the next 10, 15 years are really, really disruptive from this perspective, what kinds of things would
*  you think about? Well, I wish I was more creative on these things. I, when I try to think about how
*  do we deal with rapid change, being a pretty boring kind of a conventional social democrat who says,
*  look, change happens. You can't preserve jobs that technology no longer considers necessary.
*  You can't stop progress, but you can try to cushion people from some of the worst effects.
*  There's social democratic agenda of strong insurance that makes sure that people aren't
*  impoverished, aren't without healthcare if a machine happens to take their job.
*  That does a lot. It doesn't do everything. It doesn't restore dignity. If your identity,
*  if your sense of self is bound up with being a, well, in the past, we had people who were proud
*  of being coal miners. And then suddenly technology said, we don't actually really need coal miners
*  anymore because we just blow the tops off mountains. You can give those people healthcare,
*  you can give them food stamps. You can't give them the life they had before. Now it may be claims
*  adjusters who are suddenly find that what they were doing is no longer necessary. And I don't
*  have great ideas there. I don't think that the, you know, we try and try retraining, but that
*  has never actually been hugely successful as a way of coping with economic change. Probably just need
*  to try a bunch of stuff, hope that some of it works, but mostly what we can do is we can at least
*  limit the amount of misery. I think it's a good place to end. So as our final question,
*  what are three books you'd recommend to the audience? Okay. So first off, Brad DeLong,
*  my friend and economist and historian has this wonderful book called slouching towards utopia,
*  which is a history of what he calls the long 20th century. And if you just want to understand how
*  the world changed from, he says that 1870 was the pivot point of history. You got to read that book.
*  I have recently reread How the War was Won by Phillips O'Brien, who's a military historian.
*  And it's a book about World War II, but he's become a prolific commentator on the war in
*  Ukraine. And it's mostly, it's this wonderfully unromantic anti-glory view of war. It's all about,
*  look, it's really about modern wars, about production and logistics. The opening sentence is,
*  I think there were no decisive battles of World War II. And it opened my eyes to thinking about
*  both about that history and about how to think about what's happening in Ukraine now.
*  I just read a fantasy novel by Lee Bardugo called Ninth House, which is set at Yale. So I was a Yale
*  undergraduate. And if you know Yale, you know that there are anything about, there are these
*  secret societies that people of a certain type get, you can't apply, you just get tapped for them and
*  then become a lifelong member of Skull and Bones or whatever. I was never obviously going to be
*  tapped for that. I was the nerd universe at Yale. But the conceit of the book is that the secret
*  societies are in fact evil places that carry out dark satanic rituals. And it was just so much fun
*  to have my college re-represented as a place of dark and terrible secrets.
*  I love it. Paul Krugman, thank you very much. Take care.
