# Watching the Protests From Israel
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNPmdSY_Z2c)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  I've been watching, as I imagine so many of you have, as the campus protests over Israel
*  over what's happening in Gaza have exploded across the news.
*  Clashes and arrests at colleges across the country.
*  Demonstrations are now coming to a head.
*  Tonight at University of Texas Austin, police one by one detaining pro-Palestinian protesters.
*  In Oregon at Portland State University.
*  Atlanta's Emory University.
*  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
*  At Fordham University's Manhattan campus.
*  At Texas State University and the University of Washington.
*  And on Long Island, students and police clashed at a protest at Stony Brook University today.
*  An encampment was set up.
*  I've been watching police go in and clear encampments in the place I went to college
*  at UCLA.
*  I'm here in New York.
*  What is happening in Columbia has been all over the news.
*  More than 100 people were arrested after the school asked police to remove student protesters.
*  And I found it hard myself to know what to think.
*  One reason is that protests of this size are never one thing.
*  On the one hand, you really do hear at them people just shouting anti-Semitic poison.
*  And on the other hand, you can go to one of them and attend a beautiful Passover Seder
*  inside the Columbia encampment.
*  And trying to think about what to make of it.
*  Whether this is a thing to cover, whether it is a distraction from the thing to cover.
*  And I think the place I came to is that I wanted to keep an eye on power here.
*  Who has the power to change the reality in Israel and in Gaza right now?
*  I think there's an implicit default in people's thinking to some Deus ex machina, some outside
*  player, maybe America or the UN, who can come impose some new reality.
*  That's not how this works though.
*  Really it's Israel and it's Hamas.
*  Hamas could release the hostages.
*  Israel could end its war or change its policies.
*  And I think if you are listening to the protesters, the students, the idea that they really have
*  is they're going to influence Israel.
*  They want their universities to divest from Israel.
*  They're using media coverage to try to push Joe Biden to change his policies towards Israel.
*  But what that means then is that the effectiveness of these protests in the end relies on some
*  engagement, some sense of Israeli politics and culture.
*  And so I wondered how are these campus protests being received in Israel?
*  What are Israelis seeing?
*  What do they make of it?
*  When I think about Israel, I always think about this book written in 2013 by Ari Shavit,
*  who's a longtime political reporter there, called My Promised Land.
*  And I recommend this book to everybody.
*  I think it is the single best book on what Israel is because it is a book that is better
*  able than any other to hold both the idealism and violence at its heart, to take seriously
*  both the way it was a miracle for some and a tragedy for others, to make you feel the
*  work that went into it.
*  This was not just given to the Israelis and on the other hand, the dispossession that
*  was required by it.
*  It's a book that does something that not that much on this subject does, which is hold contradiction
*  without trying to resolve it.
*  And so I wanted to talk to Shavit as somebody who understands Israel very deeply about the
*  protest movement, about the increasing tensions with Jews in the diaspora and Jews in Israel
*  and about Israeli politics itself and where it goes from here and what happens if it
*  actually doesn't really go anywhere from here.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Ari Shavit, welcome to the show.
*  So good to be with you.
*  Thank you.
*  So when you look at the campus protests sweeping America about Israel, what do you see?
*  I'm deeply saddened.
*  I'll tell you what I don't see.
*  I don't see Gandhi like marches.
*  I don't see Martin Luther King kind of demonstrations.
*  I don't see an understanding of the profound tragedy that we are trapped in.
*  So if people were there marching, talking about the hostages and talking about the 1200
*  people who were slaughtered on October 7th, then I would deeply, deeply respect their
*  anger.
*  But when you see that it's all one sided and when you see that it goes from legitimate
*  to a kind of obsession with hating it, then I wonder, it makes me, beyond the sadness,
*  it scares me.
*  I think there is justified criticism, there is understandable criticism, and then there
*  is vicious criticism bordering on antisemitism.
*  When America was in Vietnam, there were anti-war, justified anti-war marches all over.
*  They never doubted the legitimacy of America, of the United States of America.
*  When France was in Algeria and Indochina, there was criticism of the entire global left.
*  No one said that the French Republic is illegitimate.
*  In a way, I'm glad you brought up the Vietnam marches, because I think the thing you just
*  said there is flatly wrong.
*  The Vietnam marches, which were right in their moral direction, were full of people who questioned
*  the fundamental legitimacy of America, full of people who were calling for victory over
*  and the deaths of our soldiers, full of people who did not march with love, who were not
*  Gandhi, who were not Martin Luther King Jr.
*  Of course, they also had marches where there literally was Martin Luther King Jr.
*  One of the difficult things about reading a mass protest movement is that it is never
*  one thing.
*  It is never, or very rarely, perfectly on message, perfectly respectable, perfectly managed.
*  If it were, it often would not get very much coverage.
*  So let me agree with you that there are things at these marches that are repugnant.
*  I frankly have very little patience myself for the way this conversation ends up endlessly
*  circling this question of, does Israel have the right to exist?
*  Israel exists, but many of the people at these marches do not hate Israel for being Israel.
*  They certainly do not hate Jewish people for being Jewish.
*  These Jewish students, as I understand them, and I've spoken to some of them, they feel
*  they have to choose between their political values and any kind of solidarity with the
*  state of Israel.
*  What do you say to them?
*  I would ask them, and ask even you, to make a distinction between the Israeli government,
*  between the Israeli prime minister, and between the Israeli people and the Israeli project.
*  I am as angry at Prime Minister Netanyahu as you are, or as the young demonstrators
*  are, because Mr. Netanyahu is endangering the lives of my children.
*  I'm angry at the Israeli extreme right, just as you are, or as the young demonstrators
*  because they are tainting and threatening the dream that my grandparents dreamt and
*  my grandparents and parents fulfilled in the most miraculous way.
*  But there is a distinction between that and the Israeli project, the Israeli state, because
*  at the end, look, when I listen to some of this discourse, people are talking that Israel
*  is a colonizing nation?
*  We have been the ultimate other of white Europe for fifteen hundred years.
*  We never knew where we'll sleep next year.
*  We never knew what will happen to us.
*  And then we became white Europe's ultimate victim.
*  So we ran away from white Europe.
*  We were not sent by white Europe.
*  How can you totally attack the right of a homeless people to have a home?
*  We are not part of imperialism.
*  We are a small persecuted people that somehow saved itself at the last moment.
*  And in order to prevent the death of a people, they transfer them from one continent and
*  several continents.
*  They revive the language.
*  They build a society, create a state.
*  They build a nation.
*  It's an incredible, incredible human endeavor.
*  You don't have to be Jewish or pro-Israeli to see that.
*  And you know, when I look around, where are we compared to Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
*  or you folks?
*  When I see that distortion, I find it difficult to deal with, difficult because the distortion
*  is so extreme, so true.
*  I wrote about it and I'm willing to talk about it.
*  We've sinned.
*  We made mistakes.
*  We are in a tragedy.
*  But to totally overlook the justice at the heart of this project and to just see the
*  flaws and the problems, I find that a distortion.
*  It was interesting to me that you kept coming back to the word distortion here because the
*  word you use in your book is contradiction.
*  I was looking at my notes from my promised land.
*  I have, and you should take this as a compliment, 188 highlights in that book.
*  It's a lot of highlights.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I want to read you one of them.
*  And I want to hear how it sounds to you right now.
*  You write, Zionism skated on thin ice.
*  On the one hand, it was a national liberation movement, but on the other, it was a colonialist
*  enterprise.
*  It intended to save the lives of one people by the dispossession of another.
*  In its first 50 years, Zionism was aware of its complexity and acted accordingly.
*  It was very careful not to be associated with colonialism and tried not to cause unnecessary
*  hardship.
*  It made sure it was a democratic, progressive, and enlightened movement collaborating with
*  the world's forces of progress.
*  With great sophistication, Zionism handled the contradiction at its core.
*  I'm curious how that paragraph that you wrote sounds to you now, because the thing that
*  people are picking up on, what you're calling the distortion, is they're seeing one side
*  of it has now taken over.
*  And maybe they're right.
*  It's a wonderful question.
*  When my great-grandparents came to Palestine, to Eretz Israel, they understood that we have
*  to make it clear to ourselves and to others that we are not another colonial project,
*  that we are not like others.
*  And they understood that while they have a particular mission, saving the Jewish people
*  from death, not just oppression, they have a universal mission.
*  The idea of the kibbutz, for example, was this combination that on the one hand, you
*  want to settle the land, you want to build a national project, but simultaneously, you
*  want to contribute to the world.
*  You have a message.
*  By the way, that's my understanding of Judaism.
*  It's not just about national entity, national existence, and definitely not about power.
*  You need the inspirational parts.
*  You need the moral dimension.
*  David Ben-Gurion and these people understood that.
*  No, we had the right to try to throw a nuclear bomb over Germany.
*  We did exactly opposite.
*  We signed agreements with Germany in 1952 to help us build the country.
*  They were so much into this balance that we experience what we experience, but we will
*  build.
*  Our revenge will be to live, to bring children, to bring life.
*  We came to death, we are surrounded by death, but we choose life.
*  That's the Israel I love and admire.
*  Sadly, decades later, we surrendered to the victimhood ethos and we used the Holocaust,
*  which is a horrible event.
*  We lost that balance of fighting for ourselves while seeing the others.
*  Then we find ourselves in a place where extreme right-wing Israelis help extreme left people
*  in America lead us all into this kind of distortion.
*  There is a separation that gets made there in your answer, but here constantly when I
*  heard Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's speech about Israel, he was making the separation
*  between the government and the people.
*  I wonder about this because Netanyahu has won again and again and again and again.
*  If you are 18 and you are in college right now, he has been prime minister of Israel
*  for almost your entire life.
*  The vast majority of it, he has been chosen.
*  His coalitions have been chosen.
*  The movement right has been chosen.
*  I wonder whether there is this separation because when I even think of Donald Trump,
*  he represents something.
*  He did not just take over in a hostile boardroom maneuver.
*  He appealed to people and they wanted him and they want him again, many of them.
*  There is something in Netanyahu that is wanted.
*  Maybe he is seen as incompetent, maybe he is seen as a failure, but it is not clear
*  that what is current Israel is against him is the right-wing project so much and the
*  callousness of it so much as the fact that he did a terrible job managing security.
*  Defend this cut to me.
*  Let's make a distinction here, if I may, between previous years and October 7th and afterwards.
*  If you look at the last few years or the Netanyahu decade, what you have seen is a terrible failure
*  of the center-left and by the way of the international community as well.
*  Basically what happened, we asked our people, I was active in the peace movement at the
*  We asked our people to accept the two-state solution idea, the peace idea.
*  Time after time they voted for it.
*  They voted for Rabin, they voted for Barack.
*  We went to the David P. summit in 2000, it failed.
*  We went to the Annapolis summit in 2007, it failed.
*  We even had the process under President Barack and John Kerry in 2014 and it failed.
*  We never came back to our people saying, true, the old peace process failed.
*  We've learned from the mistakes and therefore we offer something new and realistic that
*  addresses the harsh realities of the Middle East.
*  I'll say here in brackets, my life has been, my public life has been about the struggle
*  between liberal and moral values and the brutality of the real, historic reality I live in.
*  So the center-left and the international community have not delivered anything to deal
*  with the legitimate fears and concerns of Israelis who tried the two-state solution
*  so many times and it failed.
*  It caused terrible suffering for the Palestinians, which called terrible suffering for Israelis.
*  And then comes Netanyahu and uses these fears.
*  So historically, in a sense, I would say Netanyahu is not only the sin, he's the punishment for
*  the failure of the center-left to bring a realistic vision.
*  Israelis have not become evil and crazy and racist.
*  We have that minority in us, but it's not the majority.
*  The main problem is fear that was not addressed and the failure of the old peace process.
*  Now let's talk about after October 7th.
*  I want you to understand, and I think it's so important, Israelis are seeing a different
*  war than the one that Americans see.
*  You see one war film, horror film, and we see at home another war film, horror film.
*  Israelis are stuck on October 7th while the world has forgot October 7th, nearly forgot
*  October 7th.
*  So Israelis are totally traumatized, are totally traumatized.
*  Each one of us knows someone who was murdered, who was kidnapped, who was terribly wounded.
*  My wife sees terrorists coming into our garden and it's all over.
*  We experience real fear.
*  Now it's not just Jewish neurosis.
*  It's not just in our minds.
*  I want to compare it to 9-11.
*  What we experience is number-wise, it's like 10 times or 15 times worse than 9-11, but
*  it's an ongoing 9-11.
*  Imagine a 9-11 where afterwards Al-Qaeda keeps 133, 250 at the beginning, hostages a bit,
*  combined the Iran hostages crisis of 79 with Al-Qaeda of 2001.
*  Think of the fact that the ongoing 9-11, you would have had Al-Qaeda in Mexico and Iran
*  in Canada.
*  It's a nightmare.
*  It's surreal.
*  So if you want Israelis to replace Netanyahu, to move away from the extreme right, you have
*  to address their fears, their legitimate fears.
*  Once we address this, we can demand of Israelis to have much more empathy and generosity and
*  really try peace in a new way, in a realistic way, to stop this terrible tragedy.
*  Let me say first that I agree with everything you just said about both the psychology and
*  the geography of this.
*  I often try to say to people who see it as obvious that Israel's response has gone way
*  too far, which I do believe, by the way, it has gone way too far.
*  I do say, look, imagine that 9-11 was conducted by an Al-Qaeda that ruled Canada and what
*  we would have done in response.
*  There is, I said this over and over and over again in the podcast I did after 10-7, there
*  is no country that would permit that kind of incursion and massacre and not respond
*  with overwhelming force.
*  At the same time, I want to connect this back to what you were just saying about the peace
*  process because one thing that I think Israelis completely disregard now is that in the background,
*  long before 10-7, they had let themselves become the villains.
*  When you say that Israelis feel we tried peace and it was not responded to, I think there's
*  a lot of truth to that.
*  How much everybody tried that there are contested narratives of these peace processes, that's
*  all true as well, but I do think that there were honest attempts to try to find some equilibrium
*  that was not this.
*  I would say that went until about 2008.
*  And then what happened, and I think this is the much more dominant narrative for people
*  who have followed this and are younger here, is peace was abandoned and the settlements
*  kept getting built.
*  And so it wasn't just that the peace process failed and then went into a state of dormancy.
*  It was that the peace process failed and then it was made more and more impossible year
*  by year, that there was an active effort, the laying down of concrete, the paving of
*  roads, the erection of buildings to make it impossible to imagine that trade of land.
*  And so there's both the genuine problem you are pointing to, the question of how can anyone
*  in Israel feel safe if Hamas exists in Gaza, but there's also this other question, which
*  is how can Israel be safe?
*  How can it exist?
*  How can people here support it if it allows itself to settle into this role as the occupier?
*  So first of all, the short answer is if you want these rallies to change, and I think
*  they should or we should, the first thing is not to hold maps of the entire land between
*  the river and the sea, all Palestinian, and basically say that I and my daughter and my
*  wife and my two sons have to leave and go back to Poland because this is right now what
*  is said in campuses.
*  So if you want Israelis to take the risk again, and I think we must and I'll get into it,
*  the international community led by America has to hug and support democratic Israel.
*  Beyond that, I agree, I wouldn't use the word villain the way you use, but with everything
*  else you said I agree.
*  So I wouldn't say Israel is a villain, but obviously there are Israeli villains, just
*  like there are American villains and European villains, there are Israeli villains.
*  I think it is too complex, I just want to say that I think this is way too complex to
*  say anybody is a villain.
*  I'm saying that for many people Israel came to appear the villain.
*  They were the stronger player.
*  Oh well, the strong will get into the strong.
*  So you know what, let's get to the strong.
*  First of all, talking of distortions, one of the great distortions here that it's not
*  only about Israel, is that you assume that the weak is just and the strong is wrong.
*  That's a profoundly morally flawed statement because if I'll parachute you into Europe
*  of 1944 and early 1945, the Germans were very weak and the allies were bombing them in Dresden
*  and other places.
*  So if you follow that logic, that distorted logic, you'll be pro-Nazi.
*  So I ask everybody to get out of this.
*  This is something that happened in our intellectual world in the last 20, 30 years and it's a
*  distortion not only regarding Israel.
*  Point number two, Israel is not that strong.
*  The flaw of Israel itself that became arrogant and cocky, people did not understand how vulnerable
*  Israel is.
*  Regarding the Palestinians, we are stronger, but there is a larger context here.
*  What is threatened now is the entire free world and world order.
*  You have a Chinese, Russian, Iranian Axis attacking everything we believe in.
*  We have to see the larger context.
*  We cannot be blind.
*  Ezra, this is the most intimidating Jewish moment in our lifetime.
*  It's one of the most painful Palestinian moments in our lifetime and it's one of the most dangerous
*  global moments in our lifetime.
*  We have to wake up.
*  This is a mega, mega, mega event.
*  What happened on October 7th was an attack on the Jewish state, on the democratic state,
*  on the Jewish people, and in many ways on the post-war world order.
*  There is much, I think, that people outside Israel do not see clearly about Israel.
*  There are things people inside Israel think do not see clearly about Israel, and one of
*  them is strength.
*  The thing that I see again and again is this effort to then create a much larger set of
*  enemies to justify a deep and very understandable, I come from Jewish history too, a deep and
*  understandable feeling of vulnerability, of weakness, of always being on the precipice,
*  but I'm in America.
*  What I understand, I think better than Israelis do, is what the American politics are at least
*  right now.
*  Iran was never going to be a threat to Israel in this war because as soon as it began, America
*  moved battleships into place to make very clear that if Iran joined, it would be annihilated.
*  When there was an attack that led to the killing of a major Iranian commander, Iran launched
*  a drone strike that it understood, everybody understood back and forth.
*  This was well calibrated to be shot down.
*  Israel did a calibrated response.
*  Israel and Iran have been in a very calibrated series of just enough, in a way, to maintain
*  their domestic politics on both sides.
*  The danger for Israel, which is much stronger than I think you give it credit for, in part
*  because it is backed by the strongest military the world has ever known.
*  It is using American bombs now.
*  It is backed by American warships now.
*  When you say that the world needs to hug Israel, it is true that protesters on college campuses
*  are unfurling maps in which Israel does not exist.
*  It is also true.
*  The actual president of the United States of America has wrapped Israel in a very, very,
*  very tight hug.
*  He has then been spat on again and again and again by Benjamin Netanyahu, which I think
*  we probably share a view on how that's gone.
*  What would make Israel weak is the loss of that support.
*  What would make Israel actually vulnerable is if the politics that is emerging now among
*  young Americans becomes the dominant politics of America when they move into power, which
*  is how things typically work.
*  There is this paradoxical way in which the insistence upon vulnerability and what vulnerability
*  makes possible, practical or necessary is in the long run, it seems to me, the thing
*  that could create real vulnerability, a sort of unwillingness to recognize how much support
*  for Israel in the long run and the strength will depend on whether it is seen as a moral
*  nation by the generation that is going to take power here and that when they look at
*  it, do not see that anymore and also do not see anybody trying to prove that to them.
*  So you're preaching to the converted, but let me try to explain.
*  First of all, let's begin with President Biden, because not enough Israelis express
*  enough gratitude to the United States generally and specifically to President Biden.
*  So let me try to do my bit.
*  I think that what President Biden did in the first three days, in the first three weeks,
*  in the first three months of this war was incredible.
*  It was a heroic, realistic act of leadership, not in spite of his age, but because of his
*  age, because he has World War II at his background and he has the Cold War in his bones.
*  Now I totally agree, and look Ezra, I've been reading you, you've been reading me,
*  I've been reading you.
*  What you write about the three generations and their attitude to Israel is totally, totally
*  true.
*  I was speaking to some, in some lecture I gave in Cambridge to some young students
*  who were confused about Israel and the conflict.
*  And the older one among them came to me and she said to me, Ari, listen, I had Rabin,
*  I had the Oslo process, I had an Israel I could identify with and look up to.
*  What the younger Jewish kids in the diaspora have been experiencing in the last 20 years,
*  that they are asked to defend a nation with whose values they cannot identify.
*  I'm not one who's using the external threats, the Chinese, Russian and Iranian dimension
*  in order to run away from the Palestinian issue, not at all.
*  Israel has to deal in a much more courageous and generous way with the Palestinian issue.
*  And Israel is guilty of the fact that in the last 15 years we ignored it and it became
*  like the elephant in the room and then we saw what happened.
*  But while we, our commitment, our responsibility, our mission is to deal with the Palestinian
*  issue, you have to remember that Israel is not France, not America and not China.
*  Israel is a small, intimidated nation.
*  So I ask all people of good faith and decency to look at the larger picture.
*  I'm not asking it as an excuse to ignore the Palestinian issue in no way.
*  There's this language you hear that you're using, I'm certain I've used it, it's not
*  a criticism, the Palestinian issue.
*  But I want to make this more direct, Palestinians, right?
*  I mean, we talk about a battle for Israel's soul, but the battle happening right now is
*  in Gaza.
*  The question right now is whether or not Israel will enter Ra'afah.
*  One of the things that makes it hard to support what Israel is doing for me is I don't believe
*  the war aims.
*  If you could prove to me that if you went into Ra'afah, this place where more than half
*  of Gazans are now huddled, you would somehow with the same intelligence community that
*  could not predict 10-7, figure out exactly who is a Hamas fighter and who is a Hamas
*  commander and remove them, kill them, imprison them, whatever it is.
*  And as such, then Hamas or something like it could not reconstitute itself and some
*  other more moderate leadership would emerge and negotiations for some kind of stabilization
*  could begin.
*  Fine.
*  But I genuinely do not understand what the theory of this is.
*  You talk about how traumatized Israelis are and they are and every single person here
*  who forgets that or does not take it seriously has walled themselves off from understanding
*  the issue.
*  Everything you say about that is right and it actually infuriates me.
*  But do Palestinians not feel this grief?
*  Are they not being traumatized right now?
*  Not just the loss of life and the loss of children in particular, but the loss of homes,
*  of livelihoods.
*  How do Israelis imagine a people as traumatized now as the Palestinians are?
*  Not them as an issue, but them as people.
*  What security emerges from this?
*  So again, whether it's good or bad, I actually agree with you.
*  Mr. Sinwar is an evil genius and Israel walked right into his trap.
*  The head of Hamas.
*  Exactly.
*  What's the Sinwar genius?
*  He put Israel in a kind of lose-lose situation.
*  Mr. Sinwar is not only willing, but he wants to sacrifice the civilian population of Gaza
*  in order to change the minds of hearts of the civilian population of the United States
*  of America and turn it against Israel.
*  And he's using the hostages in order to break the spirit of Israeli society.
*  So Mr. Sinwar understands what sadly our generals did not understand, which is war is
*  not only a military operation.
*  It's not only about tanks and planes.
*  That if you win the war in Chanyunas, but you lose it in Harvard Square, you lost the
*  war.
*  You lost the war.
*  This is exactly what Sinwar wanted.
*  And sadly, the way the war was waged on our side, and I think we had to do it and we had
*  to defend ourselves and we had the right to defend ourselves, but we should have been
*  much more sophisticated.
*  It should have been clear to any person watching television or TikTok or whatever in the United
*  States that we are fighting Hamas, we are not fighting the Palestinians.
*  And right now, the opposite has happened.
*  So definitely, I oppose the RAFA.
*  Going into RAFA is exactly what Sinwar wants.
*  If Israel will make that mistake, it will be a decisive, tragic mistake.
*  Mr. Netanyahu all his life was a Churchill wannabe.
*  He wanted to be Churchill.
*  Here he has an amazing, tragic opportunity to be Churchill.
*  But what did Churchill do?
*  Basically two things.
*  One, national unity.
*  And two, he went to America.
*  He went to Washington.
*  He talked to FDR.
*  He convinced FDR to stand by Britain.
*  This is what we should have done.
*  So I'm totally with you.
*  We should not go into RAFA.
*  We should find a way to end the Gaza war once all the hostages are back.
*  We have to prevent a regional war and we have to understand what kind of danger we all face.
*  Here, I'm going to ask you not to speak as you, but as a reporter and as somebody who
*  knows the Israeli political and military establishments.
*  Because this is a place where putting it all on Netanyahu is simply not true.
*  Benny Gantz, who is the likeliest next leader of Israel, he agrees that somehow this war
*  is going to achieve the goals.
*  He agrees that they should go into RAFA.
*  If you look at the interview that Yair Lapid, the opposition leader, just gave to one of
*  my colleagues, he agrees this war needs to be continued.
*  Benny Morris, the revisionist historian who has done so much to increase our understanding
*  of the expulsion of Arabs during Israel's war that created the state, he agrees they
*  need to go into RAFA.
*  So there is a wide agreement over anything you might call from the right to the center
*  left that they need to go into RAFA, that somehow this will make Israel safer, that
*  Hamas can be sufficiently degraded.
*  Why do they think something so many of us seem to think is not true, which is that what
*  Hamas is, is not an idea, not an expression of rage that will find its way out, but a
*  military unit.
*  The good news is that quite a number of leading Israeli strategists, ex-generals, serious
*  people have been saying in the last week or two what I just told you.
*  They said going into RAFA would be to walk into a Sinwar trap.
*  It's a strategic trap and we should not go into it.
*  On this issue, I'm not totally lonely.
*  I think there are other people who think, don't get me wrong.
*  I think that eventually Hamas has to be crushed.
*  Look, Hamas is threatening the lives of Israelis and the liberty of Palestinians.
*  And we all have to unite in eradicating Hamas and liberate the Palestinians.
*  I want Gaza to be Dubai by 2040, 2050.
*  That's the future of Gaza.
*  We need to bring in a coalition of moderate Arabs and moderate Palestinians.
*  We need a Marshall Plan for Gaza.
*  We need to turn it into something that every young person in Gaza who's suffering so much
*  today will have a future, will have hope, definitely food and water, but much more than
*  that.
*  Gaza has to be an amazing project of the international community led by the moderate and rich Arabs
*  who have the resources, the capability, and who know how to deal with radical religious
*  sentiments.
*  So we have to do that.
*  But we'll have to defeat Hamas.
*  But I'm saying right now, this thing went so wrong.
*  There is so much suffering.
*  There is no hope.
*  There is no breakthrough.
*  We have to find a way to stop the fighting.
*  Again, once all the hostages are back, all the hostages have to be back.
*  I want every Palestinian to feel that he has more freedom, more prosperity, more hope every
*  year while Israel's security is not in danger.
*  But this gets to something that you said a few minutes ago, which is the world cannot
*  understand what Israel will or will not do.
*  It cannot influence what Israel will or will not do until the trauma and the fear and the
*  grief of Israelis is taken seriously.
*  And that if you want to be a protest movement, if you want to be a politician, if you want
*  to be a stakeholder that is somehow influencing Israel, you have to start there.
*  And I believe you are right.
*  But that is also true for Palestinians.
*  And what I hear is a sort of jumping, right, to this sort of world where there's nothing
*  like Hamas.
*  There's an international coalition.
*  Somehow so much money has been poured into Gaza that maybe Israel allowed this, which
*  seems unlikely to me, but that it now looks like Dubai.
*  But before you get to any of that, you have somehow done something to take seriously the
*  trauma, the grief, the anger, the fury, the loss of Palestinians.
*  One thing your book does very well is, I think, force people to reckon not with 1967 and the
*  Six-Day War, but 1948 and the violence and the loss and the expulsions of that war, how
*  they still shape the region, how they still shape how everybody sees each other.
*  This one is fresher, right?
*  This is happening right now.
*  You are right to demand the world take your grief seriously.
*  You are right to demand they take your fear seriously.
*  But what does it mean to take the grief and fear of Palestinians seriously?
*  Because that is not something, not just something I don't see Israelis doing, but I don't see
*  anybody even discussing that it needs to happen.
*  And if it doesn't happen, then I don't understand how you think you will ever live in peace
*  or even live in security.
*  Once again, I totally agree.
*  And I really, you know, sorry for using psychological terms or emotional terms.
*  No, I think we need those here.
*  I think the conflict, this conflict is about history, identity, and soul and feelings and
*  humiliation and anger and fear.
*  This is about few and again, part of the failure of previous peace processes that they had
*  economic dimensions, strategic dimension, they never dealt with the deeper identity
*  issues and you have to deal with them.
*  Look, I understand why Palestinians would hate me because of the conflict, the tragedy
*  of the conflict.
*  But Palestinian leadership, Yasser Arafat and such people, the moderates, did not care
*  enough about Palestinians.
*  You know, there was the old almost ancient stink song, I hope the Russians love their
*  children too.
*  And the Russians did love their children too.
*  And that's why the first Cold War ended the way it ended.
*  But the problem that we don't have enough constructive forces in the Palestinian leadership
*  who would care about their own people.
*  There are two terrible metaphors in the tragedy of the conflict in recent years.
*  One was suicide bombing.
*  What was suicide bombing, which were horrible 20 years ago, 25 years ago?
*  Suicide bombing is when your hate for your enemy is stronger than your love for yourself.
*  And now we have the tunnels.
*  Now we have the tunnels.
*  Rather than build skyscrapers of hope in Gaza, everything went into these dark, evil tunnels.
*  Each one of us has to cure his own society from the poison and all the toxic materials
*  of the conflict that has poisoned all of us.
*  We're all poisoned.
*  Okay, we're all poisoned.
*  We need now a process of detox that helps both Israelis and Palestinians at the same
*  time to move forward to something that is more constructive, which you now see in the
*  Middle East, which was not the case before.
*  My Palestinian hero is Salam Fayyad.
*  Salam Fayyad is the one Palestinian leader who really tried to do nation building.
*  So obviously he had his grievances regarding us and I understand that.
*  But he tried to build something.
*  We need out of this chaos and mess and tragedy, we need Salam Fayyad attitude combined with
*  an Mbz attitude.
*  Look, the good news in the Middle East is that the first time in a century we have Arab
*  modernity that works and is successful.
*  And the Emirates are like the symbol and the example for that.
*  Because what's the United Emirates all about?
*  It's about moving forward, solution, not going back to the past, not getting into victimhood,
*  but building things.
*  So if we will have Mbz like forces supporting Salam Fayyad like Palestinians, I think we
*  can begin to move forward from the agony and suffering into something that is more promising.
*  You say if there was something like Salam Fayyad, who was a former prime minister of
*  the Palestinian Authority, you would see a willing Israeli partner.
*  But I had Salam Fayyad on this show a couple months back and people should go listen to
*  it.
*  And here was somebody who is doing everything you're saying should be done.
*  And frankly, at a better time in Israeli politics than this one.
*  And he had built up a lot more economic capacity within the Palestinian Authority in the West
*  Bank where he was governing.
*  He had built up profound security cooperation.
*  He had exiled and expelled much of Hamas.
*  He had made the West Bank far safer.
*  And what he says happened is he could not get the Israelis to work with him, that they
*  would not stop their incursions.
*  They would not loosen the restrictions.
*  They would not make it easier for him to build.
*  Salam Fayyad had all kinds of problems.
*  But he will tell you, he told me that really his biggest one was that Israel wouldn't
*  hold up its end of the bargain.
*  And so there is this truth that in many points, Israel has not had a partner who could deliver
*  peace or even maybe wanted to deliver peace.
*  It is also true that there have been points when the Palestinians or at least some Palestinians
*  have not had an Israeli partner to deliver peace because some Israelis don't want it
*  because they want the West Bank because they want control because they want Hamas and the
*  Palestinian Authority split because they don't want international support shifting to the
*  Palestinians.
*  So there is this tension between the call for someone like Salam Fayyad and in the actual
*  historical experience of the actual living Salam Fayyad.
*  So after expressing my admiration for Salam Fayyad, I don't want to do polemics regarding
*  him.
*  I really admire him and I really want him back.
*  I really think that he and people like him are an essential part of the solution.
*  But I'll say two things.
*  One, Salam Fayyad had terrible problems with corruption in the Palestinian Authority, including
*  by Mr. Abbas who's leading it.
*  They wanted him out.
*  The second element that I want to remind you that while Salam Fayyad was in power, we had
*  a prime minister in Israel by the name of Eud Olmert who went to the Annapolis peace
*  summit with George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice and offered 100% of the territory with
*  some territorial exchange.
*  Eud Olmert made the most generous, some Israelis feel reckless, offer to the Palestinians and
*  it was rejected.
*  So after it was rejected, Netanyahu was elected.
*  Israelis became, again, they're not profoundly more right-wing, but they're more skeptical,
*  more fearful, more it's more difficult to bring them.
*  We need to find a way to get out of this vicious circle.
*  And again, don't get me wrong.
*  In the last 10 years, extreme right-wing Israeli governments and with a lot of influence of
*  the settler parties and the extreme right, Israel was not there.
*  But the reason they were elected was the failure of over 15 years, we tried the old peace and
*  it failed.
*  One thing threaded through your book is an appreciation of tragedy and a willingness
*  to see your own story, Israel's story, the story of the Palestinians as a story of tragedy.
*  And part of tragedy is timing, that there are moments where an opening exists for something
*  else and they're missed.
*  And then there's a moment on the other side and it's missed.
*  And something I think that that history should teach us or force us to reckon with is that
*  there's not going to be perfection here.
*  There are not going to be perfect leaders on either side.
*  There's not a Palestinian authority free of corruption.
*  Frankly, there's not even right now a Palestinian authority with legitimacy.
*  There's not going to be an Israeli polity that moves from where it is now all the way
*  to where you are farther than that.
*  And so there is this question to me of what happens if this is where we are, if the Palestinians
*  hate Israelis even more than ever after this, whenever the after this is, if Israelis are
*  more terrified of the security risk of what would happen to them if you had a Palestinian
*  state that had sufficient self-determination to become strong because a stronger and richer
*  and freer such a state became, the more could one day exact revenge.
*  I think that is how a lot of people think.
*  So what if we don't get perfect leaders?
*  What if we don't even get very good leaders, which is, I think, the recent history of this
*  conflict?
*  What then?
*  Look, we are all fearful now.
*  The worst can happen.
*  Ezra, remember my words.
*  The worst may happen.
*  What October 7 and whatever happened since taught us is that it's a make or break moment.
*  If we will let things just deteriorated, horrible, horrible, horrible things might happen in
*  the Middle East within a few years.
*  So it's a more responsibility upon all of us to get to work and to create a different
*  path and find a different path so we can prevent catastrophe and actually bring back some hope.
*  Look, human life is a tragedy.
*  We all die.
*  We all die.
*  We forget it some of the time, but we all die.
*  And you make the most of the path of the road that you have on this good earth.
*  So we have to take this tragedy and act in a sensible, rational, pragmatic manner in
*  order to bring it to a better place.
*  You know, there's this 1948 essay by the philosopher Hannah Arendt called The Say of the Jewish
*  Homeland.
*  And the thing she's describing, I've been thinking about this essay, which people can
*  and should read online.
*  And there's a lot in here, but the thing she's discussing is that there had been a cacophony
*  of views about Israel, about Zionism in the Jewish community.
*  And then came the war, the fighting, the founding, and that collapsed into unanimity.
*  And she thought that the unanimity was very dangerous because what was needed at the founding
*  of Israel was to take seriously the insights of the people who thought this could go very,
*  very badly.
*  And she says later in that essay that if you get the Israel of pure Zionism, the Israel
*  that what you will end up getting is an Israel that ends up diverging from the interests
*  of the Jewish diaspora.
*  The Jewish diaspora is deeply liberal.
*  The Jewish diaspora is exilic Judaism, as people say it.
*  It is the Judaism of being the stranger, the Judaism of being a refugee.
*  My friend, Spence Vakerman, the national security reporter said at the beginning of this war,
*  something I keep thinking about, that he cannot think of less Jewish thing than to make another
*  person a refugee.
*  And then there is what Israel is as a state, which it has made many people refugees, but
*  it also has the interests of a state.
*  And states change everybody, not just Jewish people.
*  They make you very quickly forget the lessons of being a refugee.
*  And that wedge of values, that is the thing that I think people are beginning to recognize
*  and people in Israel are under emphasizing how dangerous it is for them.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  So if I may, I'll tell you, when I wrote my promised land, the chapter I loved writing
*  most was the chapter about the 1950s.
*  Because what Israel did in its first decade of existence is the most heroic and breathtaking
*  enterprise one can imagine.
*  650,000 Jews observed one million refugees, no, one million immigrants, of which half
*  were, or many of them were Holocaust survivors and other refugees from the Arab world.
*  Now, it's as if America today would absorb 500 million immigrants.
*  I understand you have a slight problem with seven million.
*  So it was an incredible, incredible achievement.
*  But what's so impressive about it?
*  That those people who came out of Auschwitz with numbers on their arms, with nightmares
*  at night, they never surrendered to victimhood.
*  They never saw themselves as victims.
*  They didn't hate.
*  And for me, the beauty of being Jewish, of the Jewish tradition, you know, I'm a non
*  I'm very passionate Jew.
*  The beauty is that we are a universal tribe.
*  We are a tribe, but with a universal mission and a universal commitment.
*  And what happened in recent decades, that Israel went into the tribal, the particular,
*  while diaspora Jews, non-orthodox, went into the universal.
*  And again, I think we should meet again at this universal tribalism, at this beauty of
*  a tribe being proud of our heritage, of who we are.
*  We have rights like any others, and we should not be ashamed of ourselves.
*  We should be proud of ourselves.
*  But at the same time, having universal values at the core of our existence, whether in Israel
*  or in the diaspora.
*  But do people in the other political movements in Israel, I understand that they think that
*  outside Israel, we're naive, that outside Israel, we don't understand.
*  And this is probably true.
*  What it feels like to live inside this kind of danger.
*  But do they actually understand that if they demand that the price of supporting Israel
*  is to give up on universalism, to give up on all these other commitments that are core
*  to the values of at least most Western Jews?
*  I mean, you can see what our politics are.
*  Some people will choose Israel.
*  I mean, there is some evidence, in fact, post 10-7.
*  And I understand this myself.
*  It has forced me to deeply reengage with Israel.
*  There is some people who will choose Israel.
*  They will say push comes to shove.
*  The particularism is dominant in me.
*  There are many who won't.
*  And you can say a lot about what is happening on campuses.
*  And you can say a lot about what is happening at the protests.
*  I got an email the other day from a grad student at Columbia.
*  And he said something to me that I've been hearing from a lot of students, which is that
*  he doesn't feel the protests are anti-Semitic, though they do attract anti-Semites.
*  What he does feel is that he is being asked to choose between a kind of thoroughgoing
*  anti-Zionism, right?
*  A Zionism that believes Israel to be a stain that must be erased and being a sort of social
*  progressive on his campus in good standing.
*  And I don't know what choice he'll make.
*  I don't know what choice a lot of people make.
*  But do people in Israel, this is my question as a Jew living in America, do people in Israel,
*  the kind of people in leadership in Israel, the Benny Gonses of the world, do they understand
*  that if that is the choice ultimately, that a lot of people are going to choose their
*  politics over a country they don't live in, that they don't have this memory of it as
*  a refuge or a miracle, they have a memory of it as something that makes their day to
*  day defense of who they are difficult?
*  Because that seems to me to be what's happening to a lot of college students right now.
*  I don't know what they will choose, but it appears to me to be a more significant threat
*  to the relationship between the diaspora and Israel than people in Israel really seem to
*  realize.
*  I said before, and I'll repeat it for once, you have justified criticism of Israel because
*  there is wrongdoing.
*  You have understandable criticism of Israel because some things that are actually justified,
*  but it's difficult to understand when you don't get the complexity.
*  There is the vicious criticism of Israel and there's anti-Semitism.
*  And I'll tell you where I see the line crossed.
*  When people deny the Jewish people's right for self-determination and when people deny
*  the Jewish people's right for self-defense, that's when vicious criticism becomes anti-Semitism.
*  That's the new anti-Semitism.
*  Just the way that my great-great-great-grandfather was treated in his shtetl in Eastern Europe
*  as the odd person, as the other, as the one who is not like the others, this is the way
*  the Jewish people is treated now by many, not all, but it was treated by many.
*  And I say, no, when you come to judge Israel, you should criticize many things, but take
*  a universal standard.
*  You want to criticize the way we wage war, compare it to the way America waged war in
*  Iraq and Afghanistan and in other places.
*  Look, I want to say I agree with you.
*  I agree with you and I think this point is fair.
*  But the wedge being driven, the thing I want to push you to answer to or at least think
*  about here, the wedge being driven between Jewish students in Israel is not should Israel
*  exist, do the Jewish people have a right to self-determination?
*  But if Israel exists like this, if it is this Israel, if it keeps going down this path,
*  is it really consistent with who you believe yourself to be to support it?
*  That there could be a self-determining Israel that you could support?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  But for a lot of us, frankly, for me, that's not been around for 15 years.
*  It's easy to rebut the anti-Semite.
*  But that's not the thing that is going to wedge these Jews, these young Jews from Israel.
*  The thing that's going to wedge them from Israel is actual things happening in Israel,
*  the things that Smotrich and Ben-Gavir and frankly Netanyahu actually say.
*  And so I don't know, I worry so much people are, they have managed to convince themselves
*  that if they can argue down the anti-Semites, they have solved the problem.
*  But I think they are distracting themselves from the problem with the anti-Semites.
*  I don't want this situation where it seems that Israel is in conflict with liberal America.
*  This is unbearable for me.
*  This is unbearable.
*  So I think that the extreme right in Israel that speaks in the names of nationalism is
*  destroying the nation-state of the Jewish people.
*  I think that some in the extreme right who speak in the name of Zionism endanger the
*  Zionist project.
*  And some in the extreme right who speak in the name of Judaism are betraying half the
*  Jewish people.
*  How can extreme right and extreme Orthodox people speak in the name of Judaism and actually
*  send away half or more than half of the Jewish people?
*  We live in a free world, thank God.
*  Still, I cannot expect any Jewish youngster, any young man or young girl to stick to their
*  Judaism and stick to their commitment to a Jewish state when that state turns its back
*  on their values altogether.
*  That doesn't fly.
*  It doesn't work.
*  And I say it's not only non-democratic and non-liberal.
*  It's non-Jewish.
*  Look, talking about the Jewish mission of this time, we need to build a non-extremist
*  Jewish coalition in the diaspora in Israel to fight the dark forces.
*  We are having a fight for...
*  It's a battle for Israel's soul.
*  It's a real battle for Israel's soul.
*  We have dark forces.
*  They are not the majority.
*  They took over the government.
*  They are not the majority, but they are there.
*  And in order to fight them, we all have to be much better than we were.
*  We have to be much more courageous and smart politically.
*  But we need a kind of great Jewish coalition for that.
*  So let's take this grave danger that we are now all aware of and deal with it again in
*  my admiration to the Herzl's and Weizmann's and the Ben Gurion's is when they fought a
*  terrible threat, they rose to the challenge and they changed reality in an amazing way.
*  You know, Chaim Weizmann, one of the Zionist leaders used to say, you don't have to be
*  crazy to be a Zionist, but it helps.
*  They were a bunch of dreamers.
*  They dealt with an impossible reality.
*  Today there is so much more that we have in Israel and you have in the diaspora.
*  We still have more resources, more power, more energy, but we have to address this danger.
*  And it's a double danger.
*  It's a danger from without the attacks of the anti-Semites in America and Europe and
*  elsewhere and the dangers of the radicals in the Middle East and the danger from within
*  of losing our soul.
*  We must not lose our soul.
*  We have to win the battle for Israel's soul.
*  I think that's the place to end.
*  Always our final question.
*  What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  One of the things we need today is, you know, not only victims, but heroes, democratic heroes.
*  The three books about heroes that I appreciate, one is about Rosalind Franklin.
*  Rosalind Franklin was a scientist, happened to be a Jewish-British scientist.
*  She contributed dramatically to the discovery of the DNA code.
*  She was intellectually dispossessed.
*  They took away her life's work.
*  And she died brokenhearted at the age of 38.
*  And what I see in her is scientific heroism, feminist heroism.
*  She is also family.
*  She was my mother's second cousin.
*  And that book, a biography, actually brought her resurrection in a way.
*  And today she's so appreciated.
*  So I find an element of hope in that.
*  The second book that I really have been reading in the year before October 7th, when we had
*  all this internal struggle in Israel, was Taylor Branch's Parting the Waters about
*  Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement.
*  The book is beautifully written and very comprehensive.
*  What Martin Luther King brings us is the best of what happened in the post-war era.
*  I think that all oppressed people in the Middle East or elsewhere, I think it's an inspiration
*  to fight for their rights, but within the context of universal values and the peaceful
*  struggle.
*  And my third one is Truman.
*  Truman is so dear to my heart because, first of all, he was like the unlikely hero, the
*  surprising hero.
*  The fact that you come from the people and you serve the people and you don't forget
*  that you're one of them, I find endearing.
*  He enabled the world of Rosalind Franklin and the world of Martin Luther King because
*  he created the post-World War II order that gave humanity its best 70, 80 years.
*  And I really, really hope we will find the Harry Truman of our time who will deal with
*  the amazing challenges we'll face and lead us to a hopeful future.
*  Arie Shavit, thank you very much.
