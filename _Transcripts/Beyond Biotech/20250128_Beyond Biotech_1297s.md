Video Description: Is there a connection between worms being eradicated from the gut in the early 20th Century and an increase in allergies and autoimmune disease?  


This week, we have a conversation with Holoclara CEO Andrea Choe, who not only believes there is a connection, but also sees secretions from worms as a way to tackle such diseases. 




01:31-06:05: About Holoclara
 06:06-08:26: From discovery to setting up a company
 08:26-10:40: Was this a symbiotic relationship?
 10:40-12:30: As we are losing species for a variety of reasons, are there other species that may also be beneficial?
 12:30-14:03: What are roundworms secreting?
 14:03-15:28: How do you take these secretions and advance that to creating a drug?
15:28-15:44: Do you need the worms to make your product?
 15:44-16:02: What conditions are you looking to address?
16:02-16:43: Are you looking to cures or disease maintenance?
16:43-16:58: How far down the path are you with this?
 16:58-17:26: How important are partnerships and investment?
 17:26-18:12: What is reaction like to the concept of using worms to tackle diseases?
 18:12-19:25: What are the next steps? 
 19:25-20:44: Are there other cures to be discovered from other species?

# Using worms to treat diseases
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 75 and this week I actually had to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=0.0s)]
*  look up which number it was. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly LeBioTech podcast. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=16.8s)]
*  The big question this week is what is the connection between Biotech and Herbie Hancock, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=22.84s)]
*  the great musician. Well you'll just have to stay tuned to find out in this week's conversation [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=28.8s)]
*  which is about worms of all things and that chat is with HoloClara CEO Andrea Cho. While [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=34.88s)]
*  studying at Caltech she discovered that round worms which have survived the harshest environments [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=42.52s)]
*  secrete specific molecules that could block severe allergic and autoimmune diseases and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=49.36s)]
*  that worm-human coevolution may have helped protect us. They were common in humans until [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=55.63999999999999s)]
*  perhaps 150 years ago but they were then pretty much removed from our environment and Andrea [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  thinks that the reduction in the worms that used to inhabit the gut might in fact be a reason why [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=70.44s)]
*  we've seen an uptick in certain diseases. HoloClara is aiming to unlock a novel class [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=76.96s)]
*  of therapies that could be a game changer for the future of human health. So let's get to the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=83.16s)]
*  conversation. So I guess the easiest and most obvious question is if you could tell me a little [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=89.64s)]
*  bit about the origins of the company. Sure I mean that goes I guess that goes way back to my days [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  at Caltech so maybe I can sort of paint the scene for that time. I mean at the time that I went to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=101.84s)]
*  Caltech so I did the MD-PhD program here in Southern California which means you know I did [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=109.32s)]
*  the MD at USC, I did my PhD at Caltech. By the time that I went to Caltech that was kind of 2006 [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  and we had just completed the human genome project. There was a lot that we had learned about genetics [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  and scientists were actually using round worms specifically C. elegans to just interrogate [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=129.4s)]
*  genetics and the kinds of things that we could learn from a roundworm were pretty incredible. I [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=137.32s)]
*  mean have you heard of people using roundworms just to develop tools and explore the basic [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=144.12s)]
*  tenets of life? I just if I had to give a little bit of background on the worm, C. elegans as [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=150.6s)]
*  species was the first animal to have its genome completely sequenced, synaptic connections mapped. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=158.12s)]
*  I mean you walk into a lab and when I first walked into the lab I was just amazed the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=164.6s)]
*  fact that first of all you could put a worm under a microscope and it'll lay on its side [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=170.04s)]
*  paralyzed for a moment and you can use a laser to oblique any cell you want at any point in its life. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  You could also feed it bacteria with RNA and knock out any gene that you want. There was just a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=181.72s)]
*  tremendous amount of just science that you could study using C. elegans so that's what drew me [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=187.0s)]
*  into the lab and I just wanted to give a little bit of background of how tremendous you know worm [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=192.84s)]
*  research is. So at the time I originally took on this project to study mutations and understand [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=198.12s)]
*  genetics and at that time my PI Paul Sternberg had left for a summer sabbatical and during that time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=205.16s)]
*  I went rogue and I totally abandoned the project and when he came back he was like what what did [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=214.6s)]
*  you do and I said actually I didn't do anything. I didn't do any of the work that we agreed on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=220.84s)]
*  and I ended up talking about how incredible it was this idea of worms when you watch them [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=227.56s)]
*  you could see them they would go left they would go right they would mate they would aggregate like [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=235.16s)]
*  what is it that they're what is mediating these behaviors and how has it evolved around different [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  species and we just had these long conversations about pheromones and molecular language and I [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=243.56s)]
*  just really wanted to take on this project of understanding what it was that worms were secreting [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=249.08s)]
*  that they're using to communicate with each other so that was the beginning of that project and you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  know as I started eavesdropping on the worms we started finding these really interesting molecular [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=261.8s)]
*  languages they were secreting that were all the same. I mean the thing is I expected to go into [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=267.64s)]
*  this thinking oh this is going to be 14 different chapters on 14 different species and 14 different [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=273.88s)]
*  things that they were evolved to talk to each other but what we found was remarkable they were [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=278.6s)]
*  using the same molecular language just different letters of the alphabet to communicate you know [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=283.24s)]
*  hey there's there's a predator over here there's food scarcity over here you know there's potential [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=288.12s)]
*  mates over here and that finding in itself was how I got my PhD and so that was sort of the groundwork [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  for trying to think about okay there are all these worms and they're communicating with each other [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=302.12s)]
*  and that was going to be it I was going to return to medical school and pursue my medical career [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  but then I started thinking about you know this human history element to worms because the truth [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=315.24s)]
*  is we're supposed to have worms if you look at mummies they've had worms homo erectus before [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  homo sapiens they've had gut round worms and if you look at king richard the third ozzie the iceman [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=328.12s)]
*  they all had gut round worms mummies from all over the world had gut round worms and then when [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=335.24s)]
*  you when you suddenly took them out at the turn of the century something happened there was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=339.88s)]
*  a suddenly this increase in allergic and autoimmune disease is it a coincidence I don't know but there [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=345.24s)]
*  was this sort of hypothesis that these diseases that started arising could have happened because [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=349.56s)]
*  we've removed these gut roundworms and that's kind of a little bit of the setting of the background [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  of what I walked into how does that research then turn into you saying that you're going to start [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=364.12s)]
*  up a company using this knowledge toward human health yeah great question well from there I just [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=371.8s)]
*  became really interested in this whole phenomenon and I started reading more literature I would [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=381.24s)]
*  listen to podcasts I listened to a radio lab podcast about how this guy with intractable [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=387.16s)]
*  asthma walked around barefoot in Africa to get hookworms on purpose to treat his disease and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=392.2s)]
*  then it worked and he came back and he was selling worms and the FDA shut him down and he's selling [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  them out of mexico and there are all of these other stories like there was this article from the new [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=403.4s)]
*  york times parasite underground where all these people were taking worms to treat their disease [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=408.36s)]
*  they were taking matters into their own hands when therapies for them just wouldn't work biologic [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=413.08s)]
*  steroids sometimes it just doesn't work so that was really interesting to me because I'd wait at [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=417.96s)]
*  the end of those articles or podcasts to hear well what is it that people are doing about it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=423.88s)]
*  and it never got to the point where I was saying and here's what someone's doing about it it sort [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=429.0s)]
*  of ended there I mean the parasite underground that term in and of itself is they have to go into the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=434.28s)]
*  shadows to find this that these sort of worms eat legally so that just inspired me to think well [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=439.96s)]
*  can we solve this can we do something about it if you look at what the FDA is doing of course [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=447.56s)]
*  they're not going to want you to take a living parasitic worm right that sounds like a regulatory [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=454.36s)]
*  nightmare is that one way you're going to become thousand is it going to become zero is it going to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=458.92s)]
*  hurt you how do you know it's secreting the things that you want it to so of course they just want [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=464.76s)]
*  you to find what is it that they're secreting that could be responsible for this so that's when [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=470.52s)]
*  we thought okay we have discovered this molecular language from roundworms it's kind of like this [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=475.96s)]
*  Rosetta Stone of roundworms and their language there's got to be something in there that could [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=482.2s)]
*  be responsible for this and lo and behold that's what we found some of the molecules we studied [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=488.12s)]
*  were incredibly therapeutic if they could block pre-clinical models of allergic disease autoimmune [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=494.12s)]
*  disease and I mean it was pretty remarkable so at that point we decided to start the company [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=499.4s)]
*  so prior to roundworms being kind of eradicated from humans was it a symbiotic relationship [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=506.2s)]
*  I think so I mean I tend to think about worms that I don't ever want to say good or bad because [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=514.12s)]
*  that's just a human-centric view right but ones that are beneficial to us and ones that are not [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=520.6s)]
*  I would think the ones that are not beneficial are kind of the ones that go to your eyeballs and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=525.8s)]
*  muscles I don't want them there but I think the ones that are dwelling in your gut they are [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=531.24s)]
*  secreting things in a way that there must be something that they're secreting that can help [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=539.0s)]
*  balance your immune system and so if you think about it the worms goal is really just to protect [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=545.24s)]
*  themselves and they've been here for such a long time they're actually by some people's definition [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=552.12s)]
*  the most successful animal on earth because they're the most abundant animal by number in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=558.84s)]
*  the world so why have they been so successful since for hundreds of millions of years like [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=563.08s)]
*  they survived t-rex they survived the time of dinosaurs and the cambering explosion and all of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=568.44s)]
*  that how have them they've been able to scroll away in all these different environments they have had [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  the luxury of time to secrete the perfect molecular tool set of things that can help modify their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=580.0400000000001s)]
*  environment so in the worms in specific they're just with there is sitting in your gut they're [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=586.12s)]
*  secreting things that simply block our inflammatory response to that worm so for example [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=591.4s)]
*  eosinophilic diseases the eosinophil is actually designed to get rid of parasitic worms so could it [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=597.5600000000001s)]
*  be that people with eosinophilic diseases actually their body thinks that there's a worm there when [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=603.96s)]
*  there isn't and so it's starting to attack its own body and could it be that these molecules that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=611.48s)]
*  we found that the worms are using to temper that response could help them it's almost kind of like [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=618.04s)]
*  it seems they're a part of the microbiome but not necessarily bacterium that the microbiome might be [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=623.88s)]
*  a little more than just a mix of i guess viruses maybe fungi bacteria that's exactly right that's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=631.0s)]
*  what we believe as well the number of species that there are now is a lot less than it was [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=638.36s)]
*  a couple of hundred years ago because of what we're doing collectively to the planet do you [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=644.76s)]
*  think that there are maybe other species that have similarly beneficial activities on humans that we're [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=649.4s)]
*  kind of getting rid of without even realizing that we're harming ourselves maybe 100 100 and let me [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=657.32s)]
*  put it this way you're a musician right yeah so my husband was telling me this story where he walks [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=665.64s)]
*  into a room and herbie camp hancock is there herbie grabs the microphone and he asks this [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=671.48s)]
*  question he says how many families do you think there are in the world and after a pause he goes [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=675.96s)]
*  one or one family right and if you think about it which you know herbie would probably like this [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=683.0s)]
*  because he's an electrical engineer think about the whole world as a giant circuit board prove to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=690.6s)]
*  me that we're not all connected you know humans plus plants plus animals plus worms how can you [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=696.12s)]
*  prove that we've coexisted for such a long time that we're all part of the same circuit board so [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=701.88s)]
*  of course if you're just going to hole punch one aspect of it and you remove it you're going to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=707.0799999999999s)]
*  lose that resource without understanding what that was doing and how you were living in harmony with [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=711.72s)]
*  that so that's our goal is to find those missing pieces which is why holoclara is actually named [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=716.68s)]
*  holoclara it comes from this greek word holoclaros which is to complete to complete the missing part [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=723.64s)]
*  and that's what we'd like to do is we'd like to return key secretions from gut round worms [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=730.52s)]
*  that are intended to be a part of our ecosystem and you know can potentially make a huge impact [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=736.68s)]
*  on human health and it's pretty cool that we managed to get herbie hancock into a biotech [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=742.84s)]
*  podcast i like that without giving any kind of secrets away to the work that you're doing [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=747.24s)]
*  one of the molecules that they round worms are secreting and how does that connect to human [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=753.5600000000001s)]
*  disease in terms of that communication in the gut yeah i mean what we can share is that they're [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=758.36s)]
*  secreting many different things you know me and my co-founders who you know includes this incredible [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=763.5600000000001s)]
*  geneticist like i mentioned paul sternberg an incredible chemical biologist frank schroeder [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=770.04s)]
*  from cornell we really thought about what is it that we want to do at holoclara and you know i [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=776.4399999999999s)]
*  think finding things that can be orally available that we can improve that we can really mimic this [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=783.9599999999999s)]
*  idea of a worm being in your gut secreting things every day we really want to figure out how we can [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=790.68s)]
*  make this a therapeutic offering how do we go from this science and how do we scale this so [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=799.32s)]
*  that's when we started thinking about who could be included in our team and one of those is an [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=806.2s)]
*  incredible chemist brian stoltz who's also at caltech and he really specializes in these [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=811.4000000000001s)]
*  nature-derived small molecules so he's helping us think about how can we even improve this further [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=817.4000000000001s)]
*  how do we make this consumable for man and he's just an example of one of the teammates that we've [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  recruited do this and i don't think that it's just the secretions are just affecting the gut [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  they're actually affecting so many other components of the immune system and that's what we're [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=835.88s)]
*  discovering and it's really interesting so how do you then turn that into something that's given [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=839.96s)]
*  to humans in terms of the mode of action and the mode of delivery because you're mentioning earlier [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  how the worms have so many ways of communication through those secretions how do you narrow that [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=851.4s)]
*  down to apply it to humans well we find key molecules that have a lot of potency we make [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=857.72s)]
*  them from scratch we put in a pill give to people it's as simple as that so it's going to be a pill [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=865.24s)]
*  that people can take that's orally available and it's something that we have made from scratch [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=872.12s)]
*  using gmp methodology things where we go through the typical checkpoints of safety [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=878.28s)]
*  and regulatory guidelines so at the end of the day people feel safe taking this look at the i [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=886.44s)]
*  really don't blame people for wanting to take out worms right like if i were someone that were i [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=892.76s)]
*  don't know the early 2000 or 1900s to the 20th century and i see this ad for remove roundworms [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=898.2800000000001s)]
*  i don't want to take it because the idea of it sounds gross i get it nobody wants to eat [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=909.72s)]
*  living roundworms so that's what we want to do is bring back these key components that maybe [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=914.76s)]
*  were intended to be a part of our immune system but without the actual living worms [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=922.2s)]
*  do you need the worms initially or do you need the worms to be able to create the compounds or [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=927.88s)]
*  are you able to do that in a different way yeah we use traditional chemistry to do that we use [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=933.32s)]
*  the worms to identify the compounds but then we use traditional chemistry to make them what kind [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=938.2s)]
*  of conditions are you looking to be able to address through this yeah that's a great question we have [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=944.2800000000001s)]
*  evidence for both allergic and autoimmune diseases that we know that our molecules can block these [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=950.36s)]
*  diseases we're starting with allergic disease to begin with and we'll expand from there is it [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=956.6s)]
*  something that you'll be able to just cure it or is it something that kind of like a multivitamin [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=962.84s)]
*  that you would take once a day to maintain that health i think that it would probably be something [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=968.44s)]
*  that people take daily or you know frequently to mimic that worm being in their gut releasing it [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=975.16s)]
*  and secreting it and living in harmony with the human body now as to whether we cure it i hope so [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=983.16s)]
*  you know that would be great and even if it's something that you're taking [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=991.4s)]
*  every day a little bit of and you keep your disease at bay that could be the definition of [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=995.0799999999999s)]
*  curing something how far along the journey are you currently yeah so we started in 2017 and i can [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1001.4s)]
*  share that in 2024 which is just around the corner we'll be heading into our first clinical trials [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1011.56s)]
*  in terms of the business side of things how important are partnerships investments and what [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  have you been able to achieve in that area oh there partnerships and investors investments [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1025.24s)]
*  they're everything they're what drives this whole operation i have a lot of really great investors [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1032.04s)]
*  that have helped us from the beginning including bold capital partner and horizons ventures and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1037.56s)]
*  more recently the nih it's something as well with it being something slightly different [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1043.96s)]
*  is the reaction to it one of wow that's really interesting or is it more of a [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1050.04s)]
*  that's kind of weird is it what kind of reaction are you getting it's a mixed bag so i i don't [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1055.8s)]
*  expect everyone to have one reaction or another you never know until you talk to someone about it [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1062.52s)]
*  you always have to give them the opportunity to be inspired by a worm story people are pretty [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  interested because at the end of the day they all know someone with an allergic non-immune disease [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1074.36s)]
*  so i don't think that we have the luxury of turning away from an opportunity like this [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1079.72s)]
*  especially if this is part of the missing link that could be responsible for allergic and auto [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  immune disease what are the next steps you mentioned the clinical trials are there other [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1090.68s)]
*  things that you kind of have to work on alongside that we're growing our team members are growing [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  we've recruited some great people to join this mission including you know i have a board member [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1102.12s)]
*  peter harten hut who is you know our regulatory expert he's former chief counsel to the fda [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1108.9199999999998s)]
*  we recruited um rick mazels who is the leading sort of worm scientist and immunologist in this [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1115.32s)]
*  space because believe it or not there's a whole field of people studying this phenomenon out there [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  so you know he's joined our mission and then i just have great corporate advisors like stan [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1127.32s)]
*  lapidus who has just reinvented his field multiple times so it's just how do we do something that's [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1132.6s)]
*  big and how do we scale this so i'm always looking for more people that can listen to this story and [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1139.72s)]
*  say hey that makes a lot of sense i want to help or i want to get involved or i want to know something [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1145.24s)]
*  about it reach out to me we're always looking for people that want to help be a part of this mission [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1150.28s)]
*  so i think that that is always going to be happening in parallel with with as we march [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1156.12s)]
*  closer to clinical trials and beyond and i assume as well that there are probably other discoveries [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1161.72s)]
*  still waiting to be made not just necessarily with roundworms but in other species as well that may [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1168.04s)]
*  lead to some cures i mean that's really partially what inspired me as well because if you think [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1174.04s)]
*  about that era that i was telling you about you know there was a lot of stuff that happened in [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1180.92s)]
*  the 2000s like crisper came from a bacteria up to genetics from stanford came from algae right [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1187.0800000000002s)]
*  ozempic do you know where that comes from helomonster so there's just been a lot of this [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1196.04s)]
*  movement of people being inspired by nature and nature has already innovated these great tools [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1201.64s)]
*  and therapies so people are mining it and i think that that that's part of what inspired me to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1207.4s)]
*  form holoclara and do this so i do think that there is this whole movement and this renewed [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1215.24s)]
*  interest in exploring that well hopefully your success will inspire some of that maybe i hope [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1221.48s)]
*  so and truly i know i mean i know a lot of the people that are doing this sort of thing and [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1228.44s)]
*  for sure we are all colleagues and comrades in this we're excited about what the next chapter [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1234.2s)]
*  is going to bring not just in terms of technology but drug discovery [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1239.72s)]
*  an interesting and thought-provoking conversation there and definitely something to keep an eye on [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1248.8400000000001s)]
*  as the company holoclara grows i think after that i will go and dig out some of my old herbie [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1254.68s)]
*  hankok albums the only problem is which era and also whether or not to annoy the neighbors by [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1261.4s)]
*  playing along with them anyway don't forget to check out the latest news and articles at [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  the biotech.eu and i hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1273.96s)]
*  thanks for listening and you'll join us again next time for another beyond biotech [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFIzHetEjmo&t=1280.04s)]
