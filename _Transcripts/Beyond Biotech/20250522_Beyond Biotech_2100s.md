Video Description: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is already changing how people research, communicate, and interact, but its biggest impacts on biotech are still to come.

Cradle is a Dutch-Swiss biotech startup founded in 2021 that has developed a web-based software platform leveraging GenAI to accelerate protein design and optimization, aiding scientists in biotechnology R&D. Cradle’s technology integrates AI with wet lab experimentation, doubling the speed of most projects compared to industry benchmarks.

In this episode I talk to Cradle co-founder Elise de Reus to discover how their software platform is putting the ‘tech’ into biotech, and learn how some of the biggest names in pharma R&D are coming to rely on Cradle to accelerate their experimentation and get therapies to patients faster.

# How generative AI and 'Photoshop for proteins' are transforming biopharma R&D
**Beyond Biotech:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dylan Kissean and this is episode 148 for the podcast. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=10.36s)]
*  AI is a part of so many conversations these days, both inside and outside of the biotech [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=14.88s)]
*  industry. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=20.16s)]
*  It's already changing how people research, communicate and interact. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=21.68s)]
*  And even if it's already having a significant impact on biotech, it seems almost certain [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=25.7s)]
*  that the biggest impacts are still to come. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=30.74s)]
*  Cradle is a Dutch Swiss biotech startup founded in 2021 and headquartered in the Netherlands. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=34.58s)]
*  It has developed a web-based software platform that leverages generative AI or GenAI to accelerate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=41.1s)]
*  protein design and optimization, aiding scientists in biotechnology R&D. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=48.1s)]
*  Cradle's technology integrates AI with wet lab experimentation, doubling the speed of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=54.54s)]
*  most projects compared to industry benchmarks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=59.9s)]
*  I sat down with Cradle co-founder Elise de Roos this week to discover how their software [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=63.58s)]
*  platform is putting the tech into biotech and learn how some of the biggest names in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=68.7s)]
*  pharma R&D are coming to rely on Cradle to accelerate their experimentation and get therapies [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  to patients faster. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=79.34s)]
*  I hope you enjoy our chat. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=81.42s)]
*  Elise, welcome to Beyond Biotech. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  Thank you Dylan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  I want to get started by learning a little bit about you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  Can you share a little bit about this journey of yours? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=92.5s)]
*  You seem to have a real interest in life sciences right from the start. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=94.7s)]
*  You did your masters, you did your PhD. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=99.34s)]
*  What sparked this passion? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, thinking back to my first encounter with DNA, it was actually in a fifth grade [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  presentation on explorers of the early world and I pasted a gif of a rotating molecule [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=112.58s)]
*  of DNA. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=119.78s)]
*  It had nothing to do with the stories. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=121.02s)]
*  Sorry, but I thought it looked pretty. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=122.62s)]
*  I didn't know what it was. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=124.86s)]
*  And it was only later that I figured, oh wow, this molecule besides being really beautiful [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=126.46s)]
*  is also really awesome in how it shapes life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=130.98s)]
*  I think the spark for me really came later when studying at TU Delft biotechnology, which [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=134.34s)]
*  has a very strong history of engineering yeast and applications of microorganisms like yeast [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=145.78s)]
*  in industry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=152.9s)]
*  That for me was connecting the fascination for DNA as a molecule to, wow, we can actually [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=155.38s)]
*  use it to engineer biology and then drive results in a larger scale, so an industry [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=163.3s)]
*  for chemicals or for pharmaceuticals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=168.86s)]
*  And your doctor work at DTU, what did you write about? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=172.66s)]
*  That was on fungi, so filamentous fungi. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=178.26s)]
*  They're pretty cool. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=181.22s)]
*  They can influence their environment by making all sorts of beautiful molecules, which can [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=182.36s)]
*  turn into small molecule drugs. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=186.78s)]
*  They're also extremely efficient at making proteins at very high concentrations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=188.7s)]
*  You can use that in all sorts of applications like making dairy protein. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  And you finished your PhD. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=200.94s)]
*  You moved on to some roles in industry there in Zymergan, Perfect Day, Fries and Campina. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=202.78s)]
*  How did these sort of experiences shape your perspective on what industry can do with biotechnology? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=208.66s)]
*  So Perfect Day was a really good place to see how a single ingredient made in biotech [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=215.82s)]
*  can help to unblock or shape an industry. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  So at Perfect Day, what we were working on was making whey protein, but rather than from [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=227.5s)]
*  a cow, making that from fermentation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=234.42s)]
*  And if you think about milk, of course, it has all these different components and you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=237.34s)]
*  can't tune a cow to produce more or less of a specific component like whey protein. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=241.22s)]
*  But you can turn on a fermentor or fermentation process and make that ingredient very precisely. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  So the precision fermentation at lower impact and thereby help to bring the system into [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=253.77999999999997s)]
*  balance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=261.5s)]
*  At Zymergan, the cool thing there was learning the importance of high throughput reliable [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=264.02s)]
*  data. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=271.02s)]
*  And so it was a synthetic biology company in California with a ton of robotics and lab [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=272.02s)]
*  automation and really the ability for any scientist to run hundreds of experiments [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  per week. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  And so these different experiences you had, was there one particular moment that led you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=284.62s)]
*  to the decision to say, look, I'm going to co-found something, I'm going to build something [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  of my own? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=293.88s)]
*  I wish there was. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=296.98s)]
*  I mean, I think it was more, if I answer this honestly, more a gradual process of understanding [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=298.26s)]
*  the power of the approaches that are used in labs today. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=306.86s)]
*  So really the power of running more experiments to just have more shots on goal, but also [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=310.42s)]
*  the limitation of running experiments and seeing pretty low success rates. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=315.82s)]
*  And so the realization that scaling out experimentation is only part of the story, but the other part [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=321.26s)]
*  of the story needs to be putting in better designs and better hypotheses into those experiments [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  to make the most of this time and energy and all the resources that you're spending in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=331.7s)]
*  the wet lab. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=335.66s)]
*  And so that is what sparked the conversations with the folks who became co-founders at Cradle [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  to explore how we can best bring machine learning and generative AI into that workflow of a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=344.86s)]
*  wet lab scientist like I was up till then. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=352.18s)]
*  I guess moving from being a scientist to a co-founder, though, means you have to take [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=356.5s)]
*  on a lot of different responsibilities and a lot more responsibility. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  You know, setting up that wet lab, working on partnerships. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=364.78s)]
*  When it comes to the business side, the entrepreneurial side, how's that been for you? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=368.84s)]
*  Have you enjoyed that part of the journey as well? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  Oh, it's wonderful. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=375.82s)]
*  It was never an explicit goal of mine to become an entrepreneur, but there's just so much [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=377.78s)]
*  that goes into building a company, like building the technology, figuring out really which [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=382.56s)]
*  customers you're going to serve, building out this team. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=388.44s)]
*  I think what has been the most rewarding in building Cradle is this technical courage [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=392.52s)]
*  that is very deeply embedded in the company. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=399.2s)]
*  So by that, I mean choosing the problem that you want to solve and then learning the skills [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=401.24s)]
*  that are needed to solve it rather than starting from your own skills and going, where [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=407.84s)]
*  can I apply them? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=412.36s)]
*  And that goes for everyone working at Cradle at an individual level. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=414.36s)]
*  So there's a lot of interdisciplinary learning because we're working at this intersection [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=420.12s)]
*  of machine learning, generative AI and biotechnology. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=423.76s)]
*  But it also means as a company that you have technical courage by building the team that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=427.64s)]
*  is best enabled to solve this big problem or really help to drive the impact in the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  world that you want to see. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=442.04s)]
*  Let's talk about Cradle for a second and really introduce it for anyone who doesn't know [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=444.44s)]
*  Cradle. Can you describe its core mission and how you really aim to impact biotechnology? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=448.68s)]
*  And I guess in particular in areas like sustainability and when it comes to health. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so our mission at Cradle is to help scientists develop better proteins in less [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=460.24s)]
*  time and fewer experiments. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  What we're doing is building a software platform that scientists can use to bring generative [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=469.12s)]
*  AI into their web lab protein engineering workflow. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=473.6s)]
*  And so the challenge that we're addressing is that engineering proteins means that you're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=478.2s)]
*  shaping a protein and trying to adjust it so that it meets all these different requirements [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=483.0s)]
*  in order to be able to bring it to market. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=488.48s)]
*  So if you're thinking about an enzyme, that means it has to be active and very fast. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=491.12s)]
*  It has to be very specific, but it also has to be able to withstand all the challenges [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=497.68s)]
*  of being in an industrial process or for a drug. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  It has to be efficacious, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=505.96s)]
*  An antibody has to bind to the right cancer cell. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=508.84s)]
*  It should not attack your healthy tissues. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=512.04s)]
*  But again, it should be developable so that it can be formulated into a drug that then [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=514.96s)]
*  reaches patients worldwide. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=520.04s)]
*  Given all of these constraints and all of these requirements that a single protein must [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=521.36s)]
*  fulfill, it's really challenging for a scientist to tweak it in such a way that it meets all [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=526.16s)]
*  of these objectives. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=531.16s)]
*  And that's where generative AI can really help to accelerate the process, to introduce [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=532.08s)]
*  very specific changes to proteins, to make sure that these can get to market in fewer [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=537.0s)]
*  total experiments in less time. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=544.12s)]
*  Is this the same sort of generative AI that people are talking about when they're talking [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=546.44s)]
*  about when they're using Chatchie PT and Grok and these sort of models there? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=549.92s)]
*  Or you're talking about something very specific to biotech? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=555.5999999999999s)]
*  Chatchie PT made it a lot easier for me to explain what Cradle does, because you can [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=559.36s)]
*  make the analogy Chatchie PT for proteins, where Chatchie PT is a large language model. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=564.16s)]
*  So it learns the language of humans by devouring internet and a lot of written language. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=571.04s)]
*  Our protein language models see all the protein sequences that we as scientists know in the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=578.4799999999999s)]
*  world, and so they learn the protein, the language of proteins. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=585.04s)]
*  And then you can get more specific and the prompts that you ask Chatchie PT are a question [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=588.56s)]
*  and then it gives you an answer and then you can you can Google it to fact check whether [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=596.76s)]
*  that is correct. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=600.5999999999999s)]
*  The prompt that you would give a protein language model is given this antibody sequence, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=601.64s)]
*  how can I tweak it so that it is more thermally stable and it binds more strongly? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=607.92s)]
*  And so the output of this generative model is a protein sequence that has certain amino [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=614.4s)]
*  acid mutations that increase the likelihood of this protein meeting all your requirements. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=619.3599999999999s)]
*  This is already proving somewhat attractive to partners as well. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=627.28s)]
*  You're bringing in companies like J&J Innovation, Nozizam, Twist Bioscience. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=630.88s)]
*  What do these sort of collaborations mean for the work you're doing? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're super proud of the partners that we get to support. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  Also in that list are the likes of Novo Nordisk or Corteva Catalyst. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=646.88s)]
*  Scientists are really the ones driving the real world results. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=652.72s)]
*  They are running the experiments in their labs. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  They're working on programs across medicines and sustainable chemicals and all sorts of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=659.6s)]
*  other applications. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=665.04s)]
*  And they do this with the help of Cradle. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=666.2s)]
*  And so our vision long term is to support every scientist working on protein engineering [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=668.24s)]
*  in the wet lab. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=674.2s)]
*  And this is just the start of working with these awesome teams to help them accelerate [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=675.84s)]
*  research. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=682.32s)]
*  Is it hard to get people on board with this vision or are people really starting to come [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=683.6s)]
*  around now? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=688.24s)]
*  There is a lot more awareness of the technology. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=691.4s)]
*  Which is great. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=695.96s)]
*  And people are starting to see how impactful it can be. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=696.76s)]
*  There is it also comes with a challenge of figuring out what's real and what's hype. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=702.6s)]
*  So quite some demystification that needs to happen. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=708.6s)]
*  Some people are very skeptical. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=712.76s)]
*  Other people believe that AI will turn anything into gold. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=714.64s)]
*  And the reality is somewhere in between. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=719.2s)]
*  And I think what is at the heart of this is that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=722.64s)]
*  ChachiPT, when it gives you an answer, it's very easy to fact check it through a simple [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=731.4s)]
*  Google search. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  Whereas if a generative protein model provides you with a set of sequences and it says, try [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=737.52s)]
*  these sequences in the wet lab, then as a scientist, you know that testing those sequences [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=743.92s)]
*  will take you eight to 12 or even more weeks. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=748.76s)]
*  And thousands of dollars. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=752.4s)]
*  And so it is a slower iterative cycle that is more costly. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=753.48s)]
*  And before you really commit to using a novel approach like generative AI, you want to make [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=760.72s)]
*  sure that you trust this model and that it will make good use of all the work that you're [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=765.72s)]
*  putting in in the wet lab. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's really what Cradle helps to do is to to make sure that the models are [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=775.5999999999999s)]
*  developed in such a way that they are robust and that they are validated. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=782.28s)]
*  And it's a thing that you can see where I'm sitting, because behind me through a glass [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=786.52s)]
*  wall, you can actually see the Cradle wet lab that we have in-house, which we use to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=791.16s)]
*  A-B test any model. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=796.88s)]
*  So any development that we have on the computational side in our algorithms, we test [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  in-house on all sorts of different protein projects to make sure that it actually works [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=804.56s)]
*  and that these it improves the quality of these models before we ship them to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=808.5999999999999s)]
*  to customers. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=815.2399999999999s)]
*  The people working in the wet labs for your partners there, they won't necessarily [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=817.16s)]
*  have any coding experience or prompting experience. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=822.56s)]
*  How are you actually making this generative AI accessible to them? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=826.0s)]
*  Right. So one clarification is that Cradle is not a CRO. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=829.56s)]
*  So we don't offer wet lab services to our customers, but actually we we fit as a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=833.28s)]
*  software platform into their wet lab workflow. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=839.4799999999999s)]
*  And so our customers will typically run the experiments within their own wet lab or [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=842.92s)]
*  with a partner CRO that they have relationships with. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  And [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  it is very easy for them to use these generative AI [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=854.96s)]
*  techniques through Cradle without coding experience because it is a software platform [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  with a very intuitive user interface. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=864.64s)]
*  And so it's quite easy, actually, to start a project on Cradle, run models to generate [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=867.1600000000001s)]
*  new protein sequences and then test those sequences in the lab over different rounds. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=873.6s)]
*  So how does Cradle maybe position itself then on the market? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=878.8s)]
*  Are you a software company with just a specialization in biotech? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=882.24s)]
*  Are you a biotech company with a software platform? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  How do you describe yourself? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  I would say we are a tech bio company. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=891.92s)]
*  So we are technology first. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=895.4799999999999s)]
*  We build really powerful machine learning tools. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=897.68s)]
*  Those are at the heart of the Cradle product. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=904.1600000000001s)]
*  But we also make sure that there is a really strong interface with our final users. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=908.0s)]
*  So our our scientists using or customer scientists using the platform. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  So really building user interfaces that enable anyone working on protein engineering to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=920.0s)]
*  access these tools in an easy way. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=926.32s)]
*  And so we have a really powerful machine learning tool. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=928.32s)]
*  So we can use these tools in an easy way. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=932.32s)]
*  And so to get started on a project, you can run projects through the early phases. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=934.88s)]
*  For example, if you're talking drug discovery, like the hit identification phase where maybe [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  you don't have so much data yet or you're working with data from like an immunization [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=948.96s)]
*  campaign all the way through to maybe you're in a late stage project and you're in lead [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=954.32s)]
*  optimization. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=960.5600000000001s)]
*  On Cradle by uploading your data or indicating what sequence you would like to start from. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=962.72s)]
*  So which protein you would like to take as a starting point. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=966.96s)]
*  Then you define the goals for your project. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  So which objectives, what criteria are you looking for this protein to meet? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=972.72s)]
*  And the assays that you plan to run. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=976.88s)]
*  And then you can very easily configure the models by saying please don't make any changes [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=979.5200000000001s)]
*  in this part of the protein. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=986.0s)]
*  Please focus here and introduce a maximum of 10 mutations. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=988.4000000000001s)]
*  This is where as a scientist you can really configure these models to work with them and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=993.36s)]
*  inject your own understanding of the project that you're working on. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=998.4000000000001s)]
*  And then you just hit run and the models run. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1002.1600000000001s)]
*  They'll generate a small library for you. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1004.24s)]
*  And the next day when you come into work, you will have a small library of sequences [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1006.4000000000001s)]
*  that have been selected by these models from hundreds of thousands of sequences that they [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1012.08s)]
*  evaluated in Silico as the small capsule that is most likely to help you get to your goals faster. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1019.84s)]
*  And so most likely means these sequences will have very good diversity so that you've got [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1028.8s)]
*  more horses in the race and you're less likely to get stuck in your program. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1035.04s)]
*  It also means that you can have more diversity to strengthen like a patent situation, right? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1040.3200000000002s)]
*  And also just sequences that are predicted to score best across all these different properties [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1047.04s)]
*  that you want to optimize your protein for. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1052.24s)]
*  Cradle is, it was first described to me as Photoshop for proteins. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1056.24s)]
*  This is how it was described to me. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1060.24s)]
*  Is that fair and can you explain maybe what that means in context? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1062.24s)]
*  Yeah, so Photoshop is a tool that you use to edit photos so that they are good enough to use in [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1067.0400000000002s)]
*  your photo album or for your marketing campaign. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1072.88s)]
*  You can also think of image generators like Dali that can generate a photo from scratch. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1079.7600000000002s)]
*  Cradle, I would say, is a combination of the two. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1086.0s)]
*  So scientists use Cradle to generate new protein sequences with [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1088.48s)]
*  edited properties. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1094.0s)]
*  So tweaking very specific properties like binding affinity, like enzymatic activity, like expression. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1094.9599999999998s)]
*  You mentioned before you worked early in your career on whey proteins and synthetic whey proteins. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1106.0s)]
*  You've also worked now on proteins for animal free food with Cradle. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1113.6s)]
*  Can you walk me through that? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1119.84s)]
*  With Cradle, can you walk me through a specific use case like animal free food? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1121.36s)]
*  How would it work in the lab from start to finish? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1127.04s)]
*  Do we start with that goal of where we want to be and then start to use Cradle to find us the right way there? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1129.92s)]
*  Very often there are really great starting points that evolution has already come up with. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1137.28s)]
*  So natural proteins that you would like to then tweak across certain properties so that you can [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1142.0s)]
*  use them in your final application. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1150.56s)]
*  For proteins, it can mean you would like them to change a little bit so that they can be [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1154.8s)]
*  expressed, which is a fancy way of saying it's easy for a cell to make a lot of them, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1162.48s)]
*  which is useful for the unit economics of your process. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1167.9199999999998s)]
*  For enzymes, which are also very commonly found in alternative protein type foods or other parts of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1171.44s)]
*  the food industry, it can mean that you want to increase the speed with which they catalyze a [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1178.4s)]
*  reaction or the specificity so to make sure that there aren't any off products that are formed. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1184.0800000000002s)]
*  Other really great examples in food and ingredients are fragrances and flavors that we [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1192.0s)]
*  have historically harvested from plants that maybe live in endangered areas, vulnerable ecosystems, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  and where biotechnology can offer a way to produce these same fragrances or flavors at a lower [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  environmental impact. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  What about applications when it comes to medicine? Are you seeing any early work there? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1216.72s)]
*  Absolutely. This generative protein design is already changing the way in which drug discovery [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1223.28s)]
*  is done. I think we are going to see a lot of really exciting results and new drugs coming to [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1231.4399999999998s)]
*  market that were developed with these technologies. Right now, to put it into context, the mean time [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1239.04s)]
*  to get a biologic into clinical trials is anywhere from three to six years from that initial [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  discovery to phase one clinical trials. Then there's another six to seven years in clinical. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1249.4399999999998s)]
*  This whole process costs, I mean, the estimates vary, but 2.3 billion in R&D was an estimate that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1255.1200000000001s)]
*  was put out by D-Lite. This is true across all different types of biologics, so whether you're [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1263.5200000000002s)]
*  talking antibodies or vaccines or other type of recombinant proteins like cytokines or antibody [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1273.5200000000002s)]
*  drug conjugates, even CAR-T, and generative AI can really help to increase the efficacy. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1282.08s)]
*  Often this is binding strength, functional readouts, as well as the safety, so preventing [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  immunogenicity, like unwanted immunogenicity effects, and manufacturability, so things like [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1300.1599999999999s)]
*  thermal stability and solubility and preventing aggregation. Cradle really helps across different [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1307.04s)]
*  modalities and across different properties, so the models are able to drive projects forward at [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  greater speeds across different types of programs. We're working on dozens of programs with our [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1323.52s)]
*  partners across six plus different modalities and many different properties. One cool example [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1328.72s)]
*  recently was a protein engineering competition that Adaptive Bio hosted, where the challenge was to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  develop better antibody binders to EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor, which is a target [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1352.0s)]
*  for cancer therapies like cetuximab. The challenge was to create binders that were at least 10 [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1358.0s)]
*  mutations away from the starting point, cetuximab, where over 130 teams participated and they [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1364.16s)]
*  submitted over 1,100 designs. Cradle's designs came out as the winner. Only two of the 1,100 [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1370.56s)]
*  designs actually improved over cetuximab. One of those was Cradle's, and upon winning, we [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1381.12s)]
*  had the opportunity to experimentally validate an extra 10 designs. We found out that actually all [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1388.08s)]
*  of the designs submitted by Cradle would have won that competition, so we would have dominated [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1395.44s)]
*  the leaderboard, which was really cool to see because the other teams used other popular [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1400.32s)]
*  open source tools and all sorts of different designs. It was really a testament to the ability [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1406.4s)]
*  of the Cradle platform to optimize a very important property, so binding affinity, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1412.56s)]
*  of an existing molecule without having seen data specifically for that molecule. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1418.72s)]
*  We refer to this in technical terms as a zero-shot project or diversification [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1424.32s)]
*  around an existing starting point. That's medicine. You're also working in sustainable materials. Is [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1432.24s)]
*  there a project that comes to mind that has stood out as a success so far in sustainable materials? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1438.96s)]
*  There are a ton of really interesting projects that we're working on, and unfortunately I can't [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1445.6000000000001s)]
*  divulge or reveal the details of all of them because they are also with our customers. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1450.48s)]
*  One company that I find really inspiring in the sustainable materials space is Gino [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1456.56s)]
*  formerly GinoMatica. They're making bio-based nylon. You can actually buy shirts that have [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1462.64s)]
*  product in them. It's also used in things like clothing or carpets or auto parts or just the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1468.88s)]
*  stuff that we have around us. Their estimate is that this technology could save over 85 million [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1474.64s)]
*  tons of CO2, which is comparable to the annual emissions of a country like Greece or Austria. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1481.3600000000001s)]
*  Compared to the petrochemical variant, the CO2 emissions would be reduced by over 90%. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think those are really the types of impacts that biotechnology can have. So I think it's going [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1496.96s)]
*  to be one of the most interesting fields to watch in terms of planetary and human health in the coming [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1503.92s)]
*  decades. It's got me thinking. This model of yours then is a proprietary approach as opposed to an [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1510.88s)]
*  open source approach. What's the business model there? Is it a license? Do you license it out to [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1518.24s)]
*  top pharma companies or is it on a success basis? How can you describe that business model? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1523.6s)]
*  Yeah, so the business model really has three pillars. We are a software company, so software [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  as a service, which means that customers who use cradle pay for accessing the platform for protein [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1537.12s)]
*  design on an annual basis. We don't take any royalty payments or milestone payments because [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  we're building a tool and we're putting it in the hands of these teams and so they are paying for [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1551.28s)]
*  it as a tool. It also means that any IP that is generated, so new sequences that come out of [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1556.32s)]
*  cradle's models, also belong to the customer. And any data that they upload into the platform [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1562.08s)]
*  stays there. So we never pool data across customers to train models for new customers, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1568.96s)]
*  which means that it's very safe and secure. And obviously IP in this space is the gold [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1576.24s)]
*  and any company that is working on protein engineering is very careful with their IP. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1585.12s)]
*  This business model approach differentiates cradle from other machine learning, generative AI [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  machine learning companies in the space. And it means that we are a platform that [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1599.36s)]
*  has quite a broad usage. It also means that we can see where this technology works really well [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1606.8s)]
*  and we can drive results across a larger number of projects compared to going very deep doing [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1615.36s)]
*  wet lab work specifically with our customers and negotiating royalty and milestone deals. And [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1623.44s)]
*  I've never met someone working in pharma or non-pharma companies that enjoy negotiating [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1630.4s)]
*  royalty deals. It takes a huge amount of time and it's also fundamentally not what is going to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1636.3200000000002s)]
*  help this industry move forward at speed. So if you look at the software industry where [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1643.68s)]
*  my co-founders Jela and Steph and Eli came from, open source or just the ability to build a tech [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1650.08s)]
*  stack is so integral to how innovations come to market. Whereas in biotechnology there's a [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1656.56s)]
*  stronger culture of reinventing wheels, building things in-house. And it makes sense if you have to [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  give away a share of your royalties for every vendor that you work with, you're going to [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1670.7199999999998s)]
*  think very seriously about building things in-house. But we see that machine learning [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1675.6s)]
*  doesn't really scale that way. And the best machine learning will be built by a company like ours [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1680.08s)]
*  that can really run a lot of different projects and specifically iterate on the machine learning [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  models using in-house wet lab development. So what are the hurdles that you're facing then? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1693.52s)]
*  The business model is locked down. What are the technical or maybe the scientific hurdles that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1700.6399999999999s)]
*  your team is focused on and really want to keep overcoming in these months ahead? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1705.52s)]
*  So we see continuously how powerful these models are and how well they're able to [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1711.28s)]
*  solve problems across the biotech domain. So across modalities and across properties. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1719.4399999999998s)]
*  Demonstrating this does take time. Wet lab work takes time. Any iteration takes three to four [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1725.52s)]
*  even more months. And so building out the case studies to show new customers or potential [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1732.32s)]
*  customers of the cradle platform that these models work and are likely to work for their [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1740.0s)]
*  program takes time. The other thing there is that it's really important to always ensure that we [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1746.08s)]
*  are delivering the best possible quality of our machine learning, generative machine learning [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1756.32s)]
*  approaches that are at the heart of the cradle platform. And that is why we have our wet lab to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1762.24s)]
*  run experiments, watch the behavior of these models and help them to make the most out of [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1769.04s)]
*  the wet lab data that they are receiving and yeah, accelerate, meaningfully accelerate these [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1776.6399999999999s)]
*  processes. Are there any regulatory problems that you're going to face there? I mean these are big [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1786.72s)]
*  pharma companies that are globally present. They'll have labs in Europe, they'll have labs in the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1792.48s)]
*  United States and those labs will have different regulatory regimes, especially when it comes to [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1798.24s)]
*  tech and to AI as well. How are you overcoming that or is this a problem that you're facing [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1803.84s)]
*  or is this a problem for the partner to have to solve on their IT side? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1809.84s)]
*  I think as with other technologies, it is really important to not regulate the tool itself but [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1816.24s)]
*  regulate how it is used. And this is where a company like cradle does rely on regulatory agencies [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1822.16s)]
*  like the FDA to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1831.68s)]
*  confirm that the products that are being developed are safe and will not cause harm. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  That said, we do have certain areas within the cradle terms of service where we also maintain [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1844.08s)]
*  the right to not work on projects if we believe that there is a real risk of causing harm [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1853.4399999999998s)]
*  through these projects. And this is an active discussion also in the field of generative [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1861.04s)]
*  AI for protein design on how we as a community can work together to [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1868.32s)]
*  maximize the positive impact and minimize the downside risk of dual use. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1875.28s)]
*  And there are things, luckily, that we can learn from, for example, consortia around DNA synthesis [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1882.3999999999999s)]
*  providers who have also come together to formulate which types of DNA they will or will not ship to [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1889.6s)]
*  customers and how they screen for potential misuse of the technology. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1896.96s)]
*  I guess if we can look more broadly now, AI itself is just transforming biotech, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1903.84s)]
*  it's transforming tech bio as well. Where do you see it making the really big impact [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1909.9199999999998s)]
*  in say the next 12 to 18 months and how does cradle fit into that? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1915.12s)]
*  Do you mean where AI is transforming biotech or what else is going on in biotech that is [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1921.04s)]
*  being transformed? I guess where AI is having an impact, in particular this generative AI. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1925.92s)]
*  Where is it not? In companies and industries all across our society, people I think are now [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1933.6000000000001s)]
*  considering how to best bring generative AI into the organization. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1942.96s)]
*  You see it in the creative industries, you see it in software, so in coding with [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1947.92s)]
*  assisted bi generative AI, you see it in biotechnology on protein design. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aa-IM80sRY&t=1954.5600000000002s)]
