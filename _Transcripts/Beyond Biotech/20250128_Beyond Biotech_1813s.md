Video Description: Sitryx Therapeutics is a private UK biopharma company founded in 2018. It is a leader in the field of immunometabolism, an area of immunology that looks to rebalance the immune system to achieve sustained disease remission in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 


Sitryx already has big pharma validation following a deal with Eli Lilly in 2020 worth in excess of $1 billion and is focused on advancing its pipeline of potentially first- and best-in-class therapies, which could address a wide range of chronic conditions, including SYX-5219 for atopic dermatitis.


The company has a broad pipeline of small molecules against novel targets in major autoimmune indications with high unmet need.


To talk about immunometabolism, our guest on the podcast this week is CEO of Sitryx Therapeutics, Iain Kilty.

# The immunometabolism landscape
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 117. I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. This week our subject is immunometabolism. It's an area [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=17.8s)]
*  of immunology that looks to rebalance the immune system to achieve sustained disease [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=25.0s)]
*  remission in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. One company at the forefront in this field [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=31.08s)]
*  is Citrix Therapeutics and to talk about the company and immunometabolism is the CEO of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=38.32s)]
*  Citrix, Ian Kilty. So the first question is, I wonder if you could tell us a little bit [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=45.28s)]
*  about the company. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. So Citrix Therapeutics, we're an immunology company but we're focused on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=53.4s)]
*  targeting metabolic pathways to reset the immune cell response. And really the fundamental [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=58.36s)]
*  piece here is that different immune cells rely on metabolic pathways to both generate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=65.84s)]
*  energy but also generate the building blocks to make amino acids and purines and so on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  So by modulating those pathways we can modulate the access to those building blocks and therefore [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=77.84s)]
*  the phenotype of the cells. So for us it's an exciting space to work in because it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=83.16s)]
*  moving beyond the immunosuppressants in inflammation immunology which have been fantastic for patients. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=88.48s)]
*  I've been involved in developing some of those through my time at Pfizer and other companies [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  but into a space where we're really looking to reset your immune response as opposed to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=100.48s)]
*  just block the immune response once it's started. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=104.96s)]
*  To talk a bit more about that I wonder if you could kind of define and explain what [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=108.64s)]
*  immunometabolism is? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=113.6s)]
*  Yeah, so really what we mean by immunometabolism is modulation of metabolic pathways to change [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=115.44s)]
*  the phenotype and behaviour of inflammatory cells. The real opportunity here is as opposed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=121.63999999999999s)]
*  to just blocking a single cytokine like an anti-TNF or whatever or blocking a signalling [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  pathway like the JAK inhibitors, what we're doing is shifting the phenotype of the cell [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=133.12s)]
*  and moving it to more of a homeostatic state and that's the real excitement here. By modulating [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=139.88s)]
*  metabolism we can modulate the phenotype of inflammatory cells and that's really what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=144.8s)]
*  we mean by targeting it, you know, metabolism. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=149.6s)]
*  What kind of approaches are there to address autoimmune and inflammatory diseases? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=152.4s)]
*  So there's been great progress over the last decades in this space and really the first [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=157.96s)]
*  therapies were broad immunosuppressants, the corticosteroids that people still regularly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  use, drugs like methotrexate which is an immunometabolism drug as it happens, that methotrexate blocks [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=169.16s)]
*  a particular metabolic pathway called a one-carbon metabolism. So that's really where the area [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=175.28s)]
*  started or drug discovery started in the space and then the next wave of therapies have been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=181.68s)]
*  a number of biologics targeting specific cytokines that we think are involved in disease and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=186.64s)]
*  the most well-known there would be the anti-TNF, so there's various others and drugs like Humira [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=192.4s)]
*  are the best-selling drug for a number of years and that's a drug which specifically [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=196.88s)]
*  targets TNF and blocks that and shows great benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=201.64s)]
*  diseases like psoriasis and diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and then from a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=207.6s)]
*  small molecule perspective there's a number of inhibitors of signalling pathways downstream [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=213.0s)]
*  of those cytokines that you're targeting with biologics, things like the Janus kinase inhibitors [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=217.8s)]
*  that I was involved in working on when I was at Pfizer and these drugs do have a real impact [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=222.44s)]
*  for patients. If you're an RA patient this type of therapy can transform your life compared to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=228.36s)]
*  when these therapies weren't available but there's still significant medical need whilst they'll [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=234.12s)]
*  reduce symptoms, reduce long-term damage for patients. Only about 20 to 30 percent of patients [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  if we use RA as an example are achieving long-term remission. They might have previously had quite [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=245.6s)]
*  severe pain in their hands and it's now reduced that they've still got pain but it's now only two [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=252.0s)]
*  joints are swollen, well you've still got two joints are swollen and still limiting your ability [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=256.48s)]
*  to function on a day-to-day basis. So there are a broad spectrum of drugs out there and inflammation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=260.56s)]
*  is a process which we see influences many different diseases but there's a lot of medical need that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  remains and that's where as an industry I think we're really thinking about how can we go further [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=273.56s)]
*  so as opposed to just suppressing some of these pathways which we started with very broad suppressors [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  and now much more targeted suppressors to say how can we reset the phenotype of a cell or [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=283.0s)]
*  reset the process to get people back to homeostasis, back to a more healthy looking process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=289.24s)]
*  So turning the tap off at the top as opposed to you know trying to capture the consequence of the tap [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=294.36s)]
*  being on. When it comes to developing a drug, I'm kind of going off topic a little bit here, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=300.04s)]
*  when it comes to starting on that pathway do you look at how you can work alongside other drugs or [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=305.88s)]
*  is it developing a drug that works in a standalone capacity that kind of takes what's already been [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=315.0s)]
*  done further and addresses those unmet needs? I think there's elements of both of those pieces [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=322.04s)]
*  as we think about new targets. My approach here is to think when we modulate disease x with target [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=328.44s)]
*  wideness again rA with an anti-TNF, what's the biology or the pathology of the disease that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  we're not fully addressing with that particular therapy? So that therapy may have a great effect [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  on general levels of systemic inflammation but not affect perhaps local structural cells fibroblasts [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=346.68s)]
*  or in the panus in the joint just as an example. So what's the biology there that we might want to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=352.44s)]
*  address which is not being addressed? So and that may be a standalone therapy that has broader [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  activity or it may be that a therapy that you're adding on top of that anti-TNF. But in many [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=364.36s)]
*  respects where I think we'd really like to get to are therapies that are not immunosuppressive [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=370.12s)]
*  and the reason to get away from that is whilst again the efficacy is good and they're very good [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=376.12s)]
*  drugs there are side effects of immunosuppressants and you need to be conscious of that and combining [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=380.6s)]
*  immunosuppressants. There's a number of examples particularly in the biologic space where that has [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=386.04s)]
*  really increased the number of side effects. So what are some of the approaches we can take to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=390.92s)]
*  complement or to even replace those immunosuppressants and again get patients back to more of that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=395.96s)]
*  non-disease phenotype, that homeostatic setting. And I guess kind of connected to that what's your [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=402.36s)]
*  approach to discovering those pathways? So I'll give you an example with our lead Holyown program [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  within Citrix and that program's for atopic dermatitis so eXma. The big breakthrough in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  that field for patients suffering from eXma was the approval of a drug called Dupixent in 2017 and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=420.6s)]
*  it's a biologic that blocks two cytokines called IL-4 and IL-13 and this really showed great [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  efficacy for the patients and showed the importance of those cytokines in driving disease [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=432.44s)]
*  and the cells that make those cytokines TH2 cells which are type of lymphocyte being an important [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  driver of this pathology. So when we looked at our PKM2 program which is our most advanced Holyown [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=443.88s)]
*  program we looked to see where do we see the biggest impact on different inflammatory cell [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=451.24s)]
*  types. So we took our PKM2 modulators looked in macrophages looked in TH1 cells TH2 cells and we [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=456.04s)]
*  see a profound effect on TH2 cells and B cells. So seeing that and seeing that we modulate these [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=462.04s)]
*  cytokines like IL-4 and 13 which we know are important in the pathology as well as modulating [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=468.04s)]
*  other cytokines like IL-31 which you know is a big driver of itch which is one of the symptoms the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=473.72s)]
*  patients really suffer from and affects their life and so on that suggested this was a really [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=478.76s)]
*  good fit for that disease space. Now there's other reasons a good fit and I can describe that more [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=483.64s)]
*  but that would be the way we tend to think about it that fundamentally these different inflammatory [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=488.76s)]
*  cells use different metabolic pathways to regulate their activity so it's matching those modulators [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=493.56s)]
*  of metabolic pathways to the right inflammatory cell and that inflammatory cell for the right [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  pathology where we think we can add benefit for patients. There are a lot of inflammatory diseases [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=505.4s)]
*  and conditions how did you decide upon which ones to go after? Yeah so absolutely and a lot of our [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=511.56s)]
*  targets are very much pipeline in product type targets because we're not specifically looking [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=518.6s)]
*  for that cytokine that's the big driver of disease X. So for example IL-17 is a big driver of psoriasis [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  if you block IL-17 and there's drugs on the market that do that you have a really good effect [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=531.08s)]
*  on psoriasis and provide great patient benefit but our approach is a broader approach because [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=535.88s)]
*  we're modulating specific inflammatory cells and often these inflammatory cells are involved in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=541.88s)]
*  multiple diseases so for example this TH2 cell that I described as well as being involved in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=547.32s)]
*  atopic dermatitis is also involved in asthma is also involved in allergic rhinitis and other sort [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=553.24s)]
*  of allergic indications. So why did we choose atopic derma as our lead indication? Well we look at a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=561.48s)]
*  number of things for lead indication the most important is where is there a medical need [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=568.6s)]
*  and do we have a therapeutic hypothesis that matches that medical need and then after that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=574.28s)]
*  there's a number of steps. Is it a disease where we believe we can build a good translational [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=580.04s)]
*  package to build confidence that as we translate to people we'll see efficacy in those people [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=584.36s)]
*  and that's probably the hardest step in all honesty novel targets the biggest risk with [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=590.04s)]
*  a novel target is it just won't work irrespective of how well it works in a cell system in vitro [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=594.12s)]
*  or mouse so we cured lots of diseases in mice and that haven't turned out to be cures in humans. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=599.48s)]
*  So that access to being able to generate translational data is an important consideration [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=604.44s)]
*  for us and then ultimately for us as well as a small company we need to have a clinical trial [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=609.6400000000001s)]
*  that we can run in a sensible manner that addresses risk within the program and that we can get an [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=615.1600000000001s)]
*  early signal of efficacy so it'd be much harder for us to do this in for example fibrotic diseases [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=621.0s)]
*  where you'd need much longer endpoints than in atopic derma population you should be able to see [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=627.96s)]
*  some impact in patients within a four to six week trial so it means we can get those early signals [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=632.76s)]
*  of efficacy to say this mechanism is translating to benefit in patients before we move on to much [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  bigger studies but also from those small studies learn about what's the biology we're modulating [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  with our compound is it what we thought it would be from a pre-clinical perspective and who else [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=649.72s)]
*  could benefit could this drug also be helpful for people with asthma could it also be helpful for [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=654.12s)]
*  people with arthritis or lupus or whatever it might be could you tell me a bit about syx 5219 [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=658.36s)]
*  what that is and what it addresses and how it works so 5219 is this pkm2 modulator pkm2 is an [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=665.32s)]
*  enzyme that's involved in glycolysis so it's one of the pathways for generating energy within a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  cell but just as importantly it's also involved in generating those building blocks intermediates [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=677.24s)]
*  in glycolysis have tapped off the glycolytic pathway to make amino acids and nucleotides [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=682.52s)]
*  for example and about 10 years ago one of our founders luke o'neill from trinity college dublin [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=688.04s)]
*  showed that as well as having this role in glycolysis pkm2 has a moonlighting role as he [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=693.88s)]
*  described it in the nucleus so it can translocate to the nucleus of cells and regulate inflammatory [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=699.48s)]
*  gene transcription so that insight is why we started the program actually that we have an [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=705.8s)]
*  interesting target here that can both modulate accessibility to those intermediates to make [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=711.64s)]
*  nucleotides and amino acids and so on but also could directly regulate gene transcription [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=717.16s)]
*  the process of how that's regulated is somewhat complex but it's around how the different forms [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=724.28s)]
*  of pkm2 so it can exist as a dimer in a tetramer the dimer can go to the nucleus and drive [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=729.56s)]
*  inflammatory gene transcription like i described the tetramer can't and the tetramer actually is [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=735.08s)]
*  the enzymatically active form that turns the tap on really high through glycolysis so limits the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=740.2s)]
*  ability to tap off or take off those intermediates upstream in that glycolytic pathway so what our [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=745.4000000000001s)]
*  small molecules do is they induce formation of that tetramer and it has a dual anti-inflammatory [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=752.2s)]
*  effect that anti-inflammatory effect is particularly profound on th2 lymphocytes these cells which are [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=757.24s)]
*  involved in atopic dermatitis and asthma and so on it's also really has a big impact on b lymphocytes [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=764.36s)]
*  which are the cells which make antibodies and so on and we see nice suppression of human ige which [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=770.6800000000001s)]
*  is the classic marker for any a to p but as well as iggs and so on and that's why we think it could [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  also have potential in diseases classically driven by antibody production and things like lupus for [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=782.12s)]
*  example how do you target specific inflammation and not generic inflammation across the entire [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=788.5200000000001s)]
*  body different types of inflammation are characterized by different inflammatory cells so you'll get a [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=796.6s)]
*  very acute response if you bang your elbow but in them chronic inflammatory diseases you have this [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=803.5600000000001s)]
*  sustained response which often includes both innate cells these are the cells that are the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=809.72s)]
*  the initial soldiers that go out and give you that very acute response as well as your adaptive [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=814.84s)]
*  response these are the cells that are making things like antibodies and so on which is the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=819.48s)]
*  immune response which is there so that you you can clear infections and so on and that can remember [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=823.48s)]
*  that you've seen those infections before for example so you get a quick response to that but as [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=829.64s)]
*  mentioned earlier these different inflammatory diseases tend to be characterized by different [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=835.64s)]
*  cells driving the ongoing pathology now it's not exclusive it's not it's only th2 cells in atopic [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  dermatitis because it's not there's antigen presenting cells in the skin the keratin sites [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  the actual skin cells themselves seem to be important in driving the disease pathology and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=851.88s)]
*  so on as well so so it's always a mix of cells but there's different mixes at different sites [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=856.84s)]
*  and that's how you focus or target the effect of your drug more towards that chronic inflammatory [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=861.64s)]
*  setting versus an acute setting the other thing that i think is really important for immunometabolic [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=867.0s)]
*  targets is that you often only reveal the target pharmacology so the activity at an inflammatory [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=872.68s)]
*  site it's cell context dependent and the reason for that is just to go to that pkm2 example again [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=880.04s)]
*  that i was using if a cell is in the blood and it has access to all the amino acids it's really [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=886.5999999999999s)]
*  nicely oxygenated it has all the other small molecules and metabolic intermediates that it [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=892.92s)]
*  needs to exist happily it is not dependent on tapping off these metabolic pathways to make [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=898.1999999999999s)]
*  the building blocks for amino acids and nucleotides because you can just transport them into the cell [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=905.64s)]
*  but at inflammatory sites you find that the extracellular levels of amino acids and so on [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=910.1999999999999s)]
*  become depleted because the cells are trying to proliferate they're trying to make inflammatory [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=916.28s)]
*  mediators and they're using up all of that substrate so they have to turn on their intracellular [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  biosynthetic pathways they can no longer just pull it in from outside they've got to make these [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=925.88s)]
*  building blocks themselves and that's when you see sensitivity to metabolic intervention so our pkm2 [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=930.12s)]
*  activators have pretty much no effect in whole blood when we look at whole blood assays but if [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=937.16s)]
*  we culture the cells in an environment which is representative of an inflammatory site they have [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=943.9599999999999s)]
*  a profound effect on the cellular phenotype and inhibit the ability of the cells to proliferate [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=949.16s)]
*  and to make cytokines like 4 and 13 and 31 that I mentioned earlier so the upside of this is it [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=954.2s)]
*  gives you a very laser targeted approach to those inflammatory sites and not just everywhere through [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=960.6s)]
*  the body. Could you tell me a bit about one of the other things that you're working with the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=966.92s)]
*  xyx1042 and without giving any trade secrets away the partnerships that you have on that? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=971.96s)]
*  No absolutely so in 2020 we signed a collaborative deal with Eli Lilly and it's been a [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=978.28s)]
*  fantastic collaboration the two teams the Lilly team in immunology and the Citrix team have really [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=983.96s)]
*  worked hand in glove on a couple of different targets and the most advanced of those is this [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=989.48s)]
*  target xyx1042 this is a mimetic of a natural anti-inflammatory metabolite called Atacanate [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=994.84s)]
*  which was also first published on by our founder Luke O'Neill from Trinity College and essentially [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1002.52s)]
*  what happens is at inflammatory sites myeloid cells cells like macrophages will induce expression [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1008.44s)]
*  of an enzyme that makes this natural anti-inflammatory metabolite called Atacanate [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1015.4000000000001s)]
*  and it's really there to be the feedback mechanism to turn off inflammation so you're driving a big [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1020.7600000000001s)]
*  inflammatory response Atacanate builds up over time and will turn off that inflammatory event [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1025.16s)]
*  so the fact that that it has such profound anti-inflammatory activity is quite interesting [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1031.56s)]
*  and obviously there's precedent for this to build on natural anti-inflammatories like steroids [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1036.68s)]
*  from a small molecule drug discovery perspective to try and make more drug-like versions of a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1040.92s)]
*  natural process and that's essentially what we've done with syx1042 so Atacanate is actually a [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  metabolite that's been known in the literature I think since the 40s a long time but it wasn't [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1052.6000000000001s)]
*  known what it did and it doesn't look like a drug it's highly polar it doesn't get into cells and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1057.24s)]
*  so on so what we did is make a drug-like form of Atacanate working with the Lilly team the goal [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1062.44s)]
*  was to get to an IND package so a package that was ready to submit to regulators to progress to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  phase one studies and we achieved that IND package about a year ago now slightly over a year [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1075.56s)]
*  happily for us Lilly decided that they really liked that and opted in so essentially they took [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1082.28s)]
*  over the program at that time and started phase one studies early this year so that program's in [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1086.52s)]
*  phase one it's really exciting from our perspective to have our first program in the clinic hopefully [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1093.0s)]
*  it'll progress to patient studies in the relatively near future we still work closely with the Lilly [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1098.2s)]
*  team we actually met with them just last week to review that program and another one that we're [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1103.0s)]
*  working on with them it's a really strong relationship and I was really I've been really [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1107.4s)]
*  impressed with how the two teams work together having worked on these types of collaborations [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1111.56s)]
*  in the past I think this is quite a unique collaboration. What's the the mode of delivery [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1116.44s)]
*  for these drugs? Yes so one of the real opportunities we have is the all small molecule [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1122.28s)]
*  approaches to date it's not that we'd be averse to doing biologics it's just that the targets that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1129.08s)]
*  we have currently focused on are intracellular targets that are amenable to small molecule [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1134.6s)]
*  modulation so they're essentially once a day pills that we're working on now from a patient [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1139.88s)]
*  perspective that is obviously something that's seen as a really big positive relative to having [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1145.8000000000002s)]
*  injections so we think that's one of the areas where we can have real value from a patient [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1151.24s)]
*  perspective as well as obviously more importantly from efficacy and so on but from a compliance [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1156.1200000000001s)]
*  than the fact that this is the preferred route of administration we see this is a really good thing [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1161.3200000000002s)]
*  and one of the few ways we think you can really focus on resetting that immune response with a [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1166.6s)]
*  small molecule some of the other approaches that I would also think of resets are either cellular [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1171.24s)]
*  therapies there's been some as you may well know some really impressive work with CAR T cells [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  targeting B cells into diseases like lupus and more recently a lot of interest in T cell engages [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1181.24s)]
*  and so on but these are biologic or cell therapies which are obviously less convenient than the small [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1187.24s)]
*  molecule pill. What else do you have in your pipeline? Our first Holyon program the PKN2 [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1193.4s)]
*  one is focused on T cell biology obviously we've been looking at metabolic pathways in other cell [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1198.76s)]
*  types and we have another program which is more focused on structural cells fibroblasts this is our [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1204.2800000000002s)]
*  GLS1 program we think there's an exciting opportunity there this is part of the [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1210.3600000000001s)]
*  immunology that's not necessarily been well targeted with current therapies and there's [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1215.88s)]
*  other companies very focused on that specific area we think an opportunity to potentially impact [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1220.36s)]
*  fibroblastic diseases but also impact the sorts of diseases I've been talking about often have some [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1226.9199999999998s)]
*  fibroblastic components within there and then really building on some of our knowledge we've [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1232.6s)]
*  built in the pathways for making these nucleotides amino acids in T cells we think there's other ways [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1237.7199999999998s)]
*  we can go about that and we're excited to progress those and bring them forward. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1244.76s)]
*  Has there been a lot of research and work on immune cell function and now there are a lot [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  of other companies working in that space? Yes yeah absolutely immune cells and general inflammation [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1254.52s)]
*  seems to be associated with many different diseases and classically we've always thought [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1261.24s)]
*  of these processes being important in chronic inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1264.84s)]
*  disease or psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis and so on but today there's data that says [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1269.32s)]
*  inflammation is important in depression and other indications like that these diseases where we're [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1274.44s)]
*  seeing fibrosis things like NASH we're seeing liver fibrosis is the end stage there fibrosis is very [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1280.04s)]
*  much the end stage of chronic inflammation so inflammation is important across a wide landscape [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1285.8s)]
*  of diseases and people have done a lot of work through the years to try and understand immune [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1291.24s)]
*  cell phenotypes and some simple things like when I was at university there was probably one type [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1296.3600000000001s)]
*  of macrophage now there's dozens because we understand that macrophages in your lung are [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1301.48s)]
*  not like macrophages that you might find in your kidney or liver or wherever and that adds [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1305.48s)]
*  complexity but also brings opportunity for more targeted approaches there so it's probably fair [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1311.8s)]
*  to say all the major pharma have groups focused on inflammation and immunology because of the clear [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1317.24s)]
*  medical need in that space and the opportunity to impact patients. Is the sheer number of what you [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1323.16s)]
*  were just talking about the fact that inflammation is involved in more pathologies than initially [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1330.2s)]
*  may be suspected is that why there's been increased interest in the space? I think there's a few [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1336.52s)]
*  things so that may be part of it I think as we have found mechanisms that have been able to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1342.44s)]
*  impact patients some of these targeted monoclonal antibodies for example that tells you about the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1348.92s)]
*  pathology and I use that example of Dupixent being approved in atopic dermatitis really showed us that [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1353.16s)]
*  inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 would be really important in the pathology here and you could [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1359.32s)]
*  have benefits so those sorts of insights have allowed us to say well okay so we know we want [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1364.12s)]
*  to hit those elements but what else is left in the pathology here which is still impacting patients [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1368.52s)]
*  still driving symptoms for these patients that we can now build upon so the foundation has come from [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1373.3999999999999s)]
*  some of this great work with the different targeted therapies and as we increase our understanding of [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1381.24s)]
*  the impact of those therapies on patients and we immunophenotype those patients so look at the blood [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1386.84s)]
*  of those patients when they're on drugs or and so on to understand what we still need to modulate [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1392.36s)]
*  here I think that's just provided further opportunity for us to have a bigger impact [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1397.48s)]
*  and then there are different modalities which have also meant that some targets we couldn't [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1403.0s)]
*  previously go after because it wasn't obvious how to modulate them with a small molecule or [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1407.1599999999999s)]
*  biologic we can now do that degrade as always other types of targeted approaches editing whatever [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1411.32s)]
*  it might be in that space so lots of reasons I think why there's so much focus here but [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1417.72s)]
*  probably the most fundamental one is there's so much medical need and that we have these [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1423.24s)]
*  scientific insights now that we think we can start to address some of that medical need [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1428.6s)]
*  has that increased interest led to more investment more takeovers new discoveries [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1433.32s)]
*  yes I think all of the above if you look at some of the takeovers deals that have been done this [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1440.2800000000002s)]
*  year some of the bigger deals have been in the immunology space I think this just is a reflection [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1445.48s)]
*  that the big pharma companies recognize again medical need I think when you get to those big [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1451.5600000000002s)]
*  late-stage trials there's nothing better than working in a big pharma at that time because [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1457.4s)]
*  it's a bit like riding this wave with the machine behind you and you've already shown the proof of [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1461.96s)]
*  concepts there we know the mechanisms translating now we need to bring to bear all the skills to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1466.04s)]
*  build out that safety data set and show in broad populations we can really see that activity and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1471.32s)]
*  I think big companies can do that very well and there have been various deals done to do that both [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1475.96s)]
*  at phase one stage but after you've shown proof of concept perhaps in phase two or even later stage [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1480.92s)]
*  studies like I guess for example Lily did a deal with Morphic this year around a small molecule [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  modulator in inflammatory bowel disease that I think will add a huge amount of benefit for patients [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1490.52s)]
*  if it translates in phase three in those broad populations there so you have a lot of interest [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1495.8s)]
*  in the space which reflects this broader opportunity and interest how do you see that developing the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1501.72s)]
*  treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in general I think where we're moving is hopefully [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1508.68s)]
*  beyond immunosuppressants which as I've said a few times have had a huge impact for patients [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1515.0s)]
*  two how can we really drive to greater disease remission by resetting the immune response [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1520.5200000000002s)]
*  but not being broadly immunosuppressive to give yourself a better therapeutic index a better safety [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1526.92s)]
*  adverse event overall profile that's certainly the discussions that I've had when I was in [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1532.3600000000001s)]
*  Big Pharma we were talking about how can we increase remission rates beyond this sort of [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1538.5200000000002s)]
*  ceiling of 20 to 30 percent in diseases like arthritis disease like IBD and so on and how [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1542.68s)]
*  can we do this in a way that avoids some of the the issues around immunosuppression so an example [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1549.08s)]
*  from that perspective is I was involved in developing the JAK inhibitors at Pfizer Janus [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1556.4399999999998s)]
*  kinase inhibitors this is a kinase enzyme that sits downstream of cytokine signaling there are [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1560.6799999999998s)]
*  a number of approved drugs which modulate JAKs and they add fantastic benefits to patients but [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1566.12s)]
*  they are pretty broadly immunosuppressive and that's meant they largely come with a black box [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1570.84s)]
*  from the FDA label which limits uptake or limits availability to after biologics in [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1576.12s)]
*  certain settings and so on so what we'd really like to do is achieve that sort of efficacy [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1581.56s)]
*  in a way that doesn't bring that immunosuppression and so what about work in the [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1586.28s)]
*  immunometabolism field how is that developing there are examples of old drugs which modulate [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1592.1999999999998s)]
*  which are immunometabolic drugs like I said methotrexates and immunometabolic drug tekvidera [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1598.9199999999998s)]
*  which is a drug for multiple sclerosis is an immunometabolic drug so there are certainly [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1603.4s)]
*  examples out there we see ourselves as part of the leading edge for new immunometabolic drugs I think [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1607.64s)]
*  immunometabolism or targeting metabolism has been an area of focus in oncology for a period of time [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1614.3600000000001s)]
*  and it's more recently that we've seen the opportunity to apply this type of approach [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1620.52s)]
*  to driving a change in your immune response and resetting that immune cell phenotype [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1626.8400000000001s)]
*  so we're really excited that first of all Lily adopted into our lead program and that's now in [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1633.1599999999999s)]
*  phase one that is as far as I'm aware the most advanced program which is a tachyne mimetic in [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1638.52s)]
*  the space and yeah we're really excited to take our pkm2 modulator forward in atopic dermatitis [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1645.08s)]
*  and hopefully we'll be starting our phase one early next year for that program which will put [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1651.3999999999999s)]
*  at the forefront of that mechanism in immunology as well so we see this as a new frontier it's [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1658.04s)]
*  pretty exciting certainly we have a lot of interest and excitement from the pharma companies that we [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1663.56s)]
*  talk to to keep them updated and what we're doing in this space and I'm I also aware that some of [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1669.48s)]
*  those companies have groups focused in this space too so I'm sure we won't be the only ones. What [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1674.84s)]
*  are the other plans and goals for Citrix as you move forward? Well so we've been going through [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1679.8s)]
*  the transition from being a purely research company to a research and development company [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1686.12s)]
*  over the last year or so now we have that capability and we're well positioned to take [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1690.12s)]
*  the pkm2 program to the clinic early next year which is really exciting it's quite a cultural [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1695.1599999999999s)]
*  change and things as well for the company you different types of people in the different [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1699.9599999999998s)]
*  skill sets which has been great actually for some of our young scientists to see that transition from [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1703.1599999999999s)]
*  fundamental early science to this is what the patient needs and this is how we'll go and find [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  out about this in the clinic and build our understanding of our safety etc etc so that's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1713.16s)]
*  been a key transition we've been going through. We did a fundraise last year that funds us through [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1718.0400000000002s)]
*  generating some the safety phase one data and some patient data with our lead program but we [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1725.64s)]
*  see a lot more potential in the pipeline taking forward the additional programs to the clinic [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1731.64s)]
*  targeting probably slightly different processes to focus on other diseases as well on different [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1736.76s)]
*  mechanisms I mentioned there's the more structural cells or more myeloid cells are different to the [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1741.8s)]
*  lymphocyte phenotype and so on so yeah a lot there we're really excited to continue to build the [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1748.76s)]
*  company and make the most of the insights that we've really had through moving forward the [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1754.12s)]
*  programs that we have to date and reapplying that again to bring the next wave of exciting programs [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1760.12s)]
*  forward. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1765.72s)]
*  Some great background there on immunometabolism and treatments of autoimmune and inflammatory [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1766.6799999999998s)]
*  diseases definitely a company to watch. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbgu2e_z9k8&t=1778.52s)]
