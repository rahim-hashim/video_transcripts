# AI in biotech today, and how it will impact the industry tomorrow
**Beyond Biotech:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Gellin Kassein [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 144 for the podcast. In the most recent impact survey of biotechs [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=11.28s)]
*  worldwide, respondents were asked whether they thought the impact of artificial intelligence [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  on the biopharma industry was likely to be positive, negative or neutral. A full 80%, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=22.76s)]
*  8 out of 10 of those biotechs responded that the impact was likely to be positive, but just where [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=30.28s)]
*  is that impact going to be felt and how much of that impact is already a reality? This week I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=37.28s)]
*  sat down with David Del Borgo, founder and CEO of White Lab Genomics to talk all things AI and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  biotech. I hope you enjoy our discussion where we unpack how and where AI is changing the way [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=51.04s)]
*  that new therapies are imagined, developed, tested and supplied. So David, thanks for joining us [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=57.76s)]
*  today on Beyond Biotech. Before we jump in, maybe you can tell me a little bit about your personal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=66.96s)]
*  journey. You moved from biomedical engineering and business development eventually to founding [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=72.44s)]
*  White Lab Genomics. Tell me about that. Yes, so thanks Dylan for having me. I'm a biomedical [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=78.16000000000001s)]
*  engineer by training and I started my career in the medical imaging at GE Healthcare as an engineer [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=87.4s)]
*  and then I moved to more business development, marketing positions, product management, always [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=97.56s)]
*  in highly technical environment and very innovative. So throughout my career I worked in medical [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=105.04s)]
*  imaging and then medical device and then I worked in a company in the field of genomics [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=112.64s)]
*  which was you know and I got really interested and I developed a passion about the field of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=119.36s)]
*  genetic engineering. So back then I was working for this company and there was a lot of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=127.36s)]
*  innovation in the field of how we can use gene editing to create new drugs. I was back in 2014, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=134.56s)]
*  2015 when Editas Medicine was founded and launched programs to develop new drugs, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=143.36s)]
*  new treatments using gene editing and got really passionate about that. I think back then I realized [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=152.16s)]
*  I realized that there was this opportunity to use data that was kind of overwhelming in many aspects [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=158.56s)]
*  because of the quantity of data generated and the industry was not yet grasping all this data. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=168.48s)]
*  I was new and then I think my engineering brain got plugged in back and I was like okay what can [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  we do to help the industry make sense of all the data and develop better drugs in a more efficient [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=184.0s)]
*  way and this is why we decided to create White Lab Genomics to have an AI platform that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=193.36s)]
*  helps to discover and design new drugs in the field of genomic medicine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=203.12s)]
*  You say we, you co-founded White Lab right? Is it with Julien Cotino? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=208.88s)]
*  Yes I co-founded with Julien Cotino and Lucia Cinque. So Lucia she's a biochemist [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=214.96s)]
*  by training in Julien, she's a genetician. We were working together in the previous company, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=225.36s)]
*  they were part of my team and when I had this idea I said hey guys what do you think [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=232.16s)]
*  you know would you be interested to onboard onto this venture and here we are six years later. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=237.68s)]
*  Yeah your mission there I read on the website is about accelerating these genomic therapies [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=245.92s)]
*  and you said that the you know working with all of this data to make things move a little bit faster. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=251.52s)]
*  Can you give me an idea or even a snapshot of just what that looks like in practice? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=256.64s)]
*  Yeah so you know for that I usually use this kind of image that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=262.16s)]
*  the pharma industry is doing is still doing a process where they a lot of molecules are screened [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=273.36s)]
*  to be tested right you know millions or even more and it will be like similar to if the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=282.88s)]
*  automobile industry to test a new prototype would basically manufacture it as like a test you know [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=291.6s)]
*  car and like crash it into the wall to see you know how well it works and get feedback data from [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=300.88s)]
*  it and just build a new one and crash it again and build a new one and this for like a million [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=307.2s)]
*  times right and so this is where the AI approach comes in where you what you do is like instead of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=312.48s)]
*  like you know screening so many molecules and eliminating the bad ones over like a trial and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  error process which is highly costly and inefficient you do a lot of like in silico modeling where you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  based on different data sets you create models you train algorithms to predict if this molecule [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  is going to be a good candidate or it's going to fail and then when you get to your pool of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=343.12s)]
*  highly qualified molecules well you have way less so in our platform we're like 10 000 times more [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=348.96s)]
*  efficient than the global like the standard process and your chances of success are much higher as [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=356.4s)]
*  well so you save time you save cost and it will eventually be reflected in the price of the drug [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=363.12s)]
*  which are really high today got a couple of questions around the company itself i mean you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=369.52s)]
*  were also you were founded in 2019 but you were part of the Y Combinator group as well that was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  a little bit later how did you find yourself at Y Combinator and how did they help you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=381.44s)]
*  you? So yes we so had like a wonderful intern back then she was like a data scientist [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=385.2s)]
*  she was doing a data scientist internship at white lab and she said hey what what do you think about [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=396.8s)]
*  like applying to YC and i was like oh yeah but you know it's really hard to get and and you know but [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=401.44s)]
*  that would be interesting so we we tried and we were like lucky and we got in it was an amazing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=408.64s)]
*  moment for us because we also have this very international background where you know the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=416.0s)]
*  U.S. is important for us in terms of markets and so what YC had to do is so it was unfortunately [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  remote because we were like i think the last batch after they reopened in California [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  post-Covid but so we did it remote which was convenient from maybe like personal like [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=436.32s)]
*  you know schedule and stuff but not the whole experience unfortunately there however what [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=443.28s)]
*  what YC does is it helps you ask every time what are you doing that shows that you have customer [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=448.96s)]
*  traction that you're building a product that makes sense for the market for your customers [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=455.84s)]
*  and and and so i think it was very good to have us really think about the platform and the product [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=461.68s)]
*  and attraction and and how we build something that has an impact and also it exposed yourself [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  to a lot of investors a lot of U.S. based investors and i think it helped us accelerate our [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=477.12s)]
*  fundraising back then when we raised just like a couple of i think during the batch we you know we [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=482.72s)]
*  we didn't have to we didn't have to wait the end of demo day and we just closed our race before [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=489.36s)]
*  and you're leading the team now at at white lab how what gets you going in the morning what [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=497.84s)]
*  what excites you about going in to lead this team that's a great question you know [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=504.88s)]
*  the drugs we're talking about what we call genomic medicine there are incredible therapies [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=511.84s)]
*  because what they do basically is within one time or two injections you're going to cure the disease [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=518.72s)]
*  or get rid of the disease potentially forever and the reason for that is what those therapies are [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=527.12s)]
*  doing they're bringing a genetic sequence a dna sequence or rna sequence or CRISPR [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=535.28s)]
*  into the cells into the nucleus to like to to repair or you know control what went wrong and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=542.4s)]
*  repair and and make new proteins that are healthy and so so basically there is a drugs called [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=550.64s)]
*  zolgensma owned by novartis that treats the spinal muscular atrophy which is a deadly disease for [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  infants and this drug is two million euros you know for for an injection and so what what makes [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=568.08s)]
*  us wake up in the morning is that how we impact the rnd process so that we held the industry design [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=575.2s)]
*  drugs way better more efficient with higher chances of getting you know like approved in clinical [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=583.84s)]
*  trials where we design drugs in the machine and then when they get to the in vivo validation or [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=590.64s)]
*  human validation then they have higher chances of success but it's faster much faster so our target [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=598.48s)]
*  is to by a factor of three divide by three the time of development and so then you have more [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=605.6s)]
*  patients we can have access to those therapies and more therapies for more disease so i gave this [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=612.72s)]
*  example for zolgensma it's like for muscular disease but there are a lot of like brain for [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=619.6s)]
*  brain disease eye disease you know and lung disease a lot of therapies can be used and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=625.2s)]
*  applied to treat including cancer so i think what makes us you know our drive is there is a way to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=632.16s)]
*  change things using ai we didn't wait for ai to be you know fashionable like today but we started [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=638.72s)]
*  2019 even thinking about before and yeah that's that's our mission every every single day [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=647.6s)]
*  the ai is is really interesting to me at white lab you're using it for things like vector [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=654.88s)]
*  engineering for target identification can you walk through how ai might fit into those use cases but [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  also more broadly in biotech where are we applying ai to make things faster and better [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=668.72s)]
*  yeah so so if we're talking about drug discovery and drug design ai is going to help because you [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  can identify new targets faster right so so you can be a very smart person i mean this is all a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=680.72s)]
*  lot of computational data basically and if you want to look like how to enter a cell and what kind [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=686.88s)]
*  of like you know protein you need to target to have an effect and to enter the cell we have ai [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  we have ai that's going to predict and identify the right targets into cells [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=700.24s)]
*  you know by analyzing like you know billions data basically so this cannot be done by the human [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=706.0s)]
*  brain you know all alone and so the other component is like going to help like design [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=712.8s)]
*  right drugs so it fits to the target and then again it's like a lot of like [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=718.56s)]
*  deep learning models you know like how to predict protein folding like alpha fold this type of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=723.52s)]
*  also approaches to like have the best candidates and then you know so so a lot of the ai is [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=730.4s)]
*  progressing in our field with a lot of simulation how to predict you know protein interactions and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=736.8s)]
*  different like interaction between biological components so this is key and this is progressing [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=744.16s)]
*  really well in industry so this is ai for drug design then you have like ai applied to which [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=749.6s)]
*  we don't do but you know companies do is like how to use ai to like improve clinical trials or like [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=755.84s)]
*  to predict effect on patients you know and so how to select better cohorts and you do it using [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=762.0s)]
*  ai to just be more efficient when you when you run your clinical trials you also have ai in the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=769.44s)]
*  pharmaceutical industry where how to better optimize manufacturing processes which we know [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=775.52s)]
*  is a complicated and costly and a lot of like data also around that and and so the industry is like [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=781.28s)]
*  using ai i think right now you know sanofi took the lead couple like two years ago we actually [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=789.76s)]
*  have a partnership with them they are they are like a partner we're developing new drugs for sanofi [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=795.4399999999999s)]
*  and then they also apply ai you know in different business units and you know in bioproduction and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  and manufacturing and probably other things that we don't necessarily public but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=807.76s)]
*  i think it could it should be used you know in the all possibilities within the pharma industry [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=812.88s)]
*  and it's it's it's the case today it was not the case i would say a couple of years ago [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=821.04s)]
*  maybe companies like moderna they were more advanced on that and actually were successful [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=825.84s)]
*  with the the covid vaccine but now i think everybody understood this is a must have when [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=830.64s)]
*  you're like a biotech or pharma company you need a strong ai team you need a strong ai component or [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=837.12s)]
*  you need a strong ai partner and i think the industry realizes that today so target id [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=842.1600000000001s)]
*  drug design these are areas where ai is already having a big impact is there somewhere in this [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=849.76s)]
*  bio pharma space where ai is still finding its footing where it's still getting a hold on the market [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=855.2s)]
*  that's a good question i think i think maybe you know what is going to be important is what the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=864.96s)]
*  regulatory bodies are going to want from the biotech or from the ai or tech biocompanies you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=873.84s)]
*  know like what are we you know what do we need to provide so so regulatory filings are you know [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=882.56s)]
*  can go smoothly and they're solid data and convinced data which probably happens because [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  in the end you still have to do if you want to fly for ind to go to clinical trials you need to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=894.88s)]
*  still have to provide in vivo data and it's not ai anymore it's just you know it's like biology [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=900.2399999999999s)]
*  and in you know in primates or not and nhps and non-human primates so i think [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=906.24s)]
*  i think maybe this is a good question to ask to like regulatory bodies where they're going to ask [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=914.24s)]
*  like some kind of proof before you are allowed even to just go advance into into the the clinical [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=918.8s)]
*  trials and then probably you know there is the topic about like the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=925.12s)]
*  the twins you know like that kind of digital twins you can use i think could be very efficient [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=934.32s)]
*  also like you know to in clinical trials to to to compare parameters and have like a digital arms [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  i don't know the tool how is it you know efficient to date it's full extent yet but i [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=948.4s)]
*  think maybe you can progress on that as well when you're talking about regulation of course [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=953.2s)]
*  there's the the fda side the the regulation of the the drugs themselves are you also looking at [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=957.76s)]
*  regulation of ai as a technology so governmental regulation of ai as an approach [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  yes so that was you know there was this kind of there a lot of discussion in europe around that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  and i think you know i think what the key here is to you still want to be able to unleash the whole [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=975.2s)]
*  possibility of ai i mean it could be this kind of worry that it's going to take over and all [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=981.36s)]
*  you know i think i'm not worried about that i think we're like far from this level of intelligence [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=990.24s)]
*  but i think what you need to be cautious about are the data you know the kind of data ownership [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=996.32s)]
*  that's the end thing like you know you pro you create new data set or you create new models [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1005.2s)]
*  who do they belong to you know it's kind of this more like of proprietary discussions of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1010.48s)]
*  intellectual property generated by ai we can i think it's still tricky and it's not necessarily [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1017.12s)]
*  clear to whom it belongs and we need to be careful on one hand to not regulate too much because if [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1024.64s)]
*  you're going to much you're going to kill innovation and at the same time you have to have some [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1030.16s)]
*  guidelines so things are done you know consistently and properly [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  you talked about speeding up the development and trying to move forward at a faster rate a factor [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1041.2s)]
*  of three faster than the the traditional development there that's also got to make [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1047.36s)]
*  things cheaper as well there's a cost saving that comes from that right yes oh yeah totally [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1052.24s)]
*  because already in our you know analysis we impact the cost by a reduction of 70 percent in [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1058.72s)]
*  r&d so which translates basically in 350 million dollar savings for like a pharma company in like a [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1066.08s)]
*  non-clinical in the non-clinical part which is you know significant if you multiply this by the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1074.48s)]
*  number of programs they have in r&d that's like a ton of money and so i think it reflect it will [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1082.32s)]
*  and it has to be reflected on the price you know if you can produce your your drug faster you go [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1089.36s)]
*  through less hurdles less failure then it's going to impact the price another aspect that's going [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1094.48s)]
*  to impact the price which is very important is how many patients you can address you know like an [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1101.28s)]
*  issue was at some point is that because clinical trials you know they were like challenging and so [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1106.56s)]
*  they at some point the number of patients that will be eligible for the treatment like was reduced [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1111.36s)]
*  a lot and therefore like therefore the price has to go up so the company can have its ROI you know [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  so have less patients but so you know so the price is going to be like two or three million euros for [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1123.76s)]
*  that many patients now if you can address more patients because your drugs is better is more [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1128.96s)]
*  efficient and and is more adapted to like more patients or more disease then you can you know [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1134.08s)]
*  have an effect on the price as well that's also what we we're trying to achieve so ai it helps for [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1140.08s)]
*  speed then it helps for cost what about precision is it any more precise or does it do anything to [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1147.12s)]
*  improve accuracy yes i think a key for efficiency is precision so for example [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1153.6s)]
*  one of the challenge of the industry is you want to make sure that when you inject a patient with [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1164.08s)]
*  a drug you want in the specific of genomic medicine but i would say it's like similar in [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1170.8s)]
*  many situations you want to make sure it goes or it affects what you're trying to target right and [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1176.48s)]
*  not the rest you know and so for example in genomic medicine a lot of the drugs are going to end up [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1182.64s)]
*  in the liver you know so inject you inject in the blood to just target the muscle and then just goes [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1190.72s)]
*  like you know in the liver and so you know the different like different type of of target so [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1196.3200000000002s)]
*  i think the key is is really to to make sure you're able to be very specific to the targets [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1204.88s)]
*  you know to your target or the cell or the the tissue you're targeting then you're going to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1212.56s)]
*  increase the the the efficacy and you can reduce the dose because if you're like you know really [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1218.8s)]
*  targeting then you don't have to like overdose regarding precision if you're talking about [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1223.6s)]
*  personalized medicine i think that's like another step that's a bit further down the road in my in [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1229.28s)]
*  my opinion is that at some point if you know we want to treat dylan or david it's like two different [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1234.24s)]
*  people with different cell types and you know different you know genetic background and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1240.4s)]
*  everything you should be able to design a drug that's really designed for one patient i think [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1246.64s)]
*  this is we're not there yet because it means it means to produce to have like a very efficient [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1253.68s)]
*  product production system per patient but i think that would be eventually something that to look [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1260.0800000000002s)]
*  into so what it's got me thinking now is is what's the trade-off i mean this is faster it can be more [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1266.56s)]
*  precise it can be cheaper what are we trading off by using ai rather than a traditional approach is [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1274.8s)]
*  there a downside that we have to mitigate there um i think i think it's mostly beneficial to be [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1281.76s)]
*  honest because what you're what you're doing is you're you're using the alternative is lab you [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1294.48s)]
*  know so the alternative to ai is like to process into the lab lots of you know assays and and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1300.0s)]
*  screen i mean in drug design or drug discovery and drug design in particular you know i think [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1308.16s)]
*  really to be honest i think the the efficiency is mostly given by ai is mostly upside i don't see a [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1315.76s)]
*  lot of downside the downside would be the cost of computing power you know like the you know energy [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1323.52s)]
*  necessary for like computing because you're like processing like lab data sets you're using a lot [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1329.2s)]
*  of gpus i would say the the downside are mostly the general challenges you have with ai in general [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1335.28s)]
*  but because ai became so big and so fundamental there are a lot of i think work on how to make [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1342.32s)]
*  it more efficient in terms of like energy usage and resources so i think it's mostly in my view [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1349.28s)]
*  mostly beneficial you're working you said already with sanofi and some others as well why aren't [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1356.72s)]
*  these big pharma companies doing this for themselves not to steal away your business here but why aren't [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1364.08s)]
*  they building their own systems why aren't their own teams doing that is there something that's [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1369.92s)]
*  holding them back or are they just not quite as agile not quite as fast to move [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1373.52s)]
*  yeah i think you know we we have this question a lot because you know people say oh they're so big [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  company they're big company they have a lot of of resources a lot of money well in the end you know [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1383.68s)]
*  first of all they're pharmaceutical companies so what they're focused on is how they can just bring [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1389.44s)]
*  you know bring drugs to the market and you know produce drugs and and put them into the market [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1394.32s)]
*  so i think this is like their main focus and and they didn't necessarily develop a very data driven [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1401.36s)]
*  like ai-based culture in the past you know i don't know 10 years and and so yeah that's probably your [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1409.28s)]
*  second point it's like a lack of you know kind of agility that you can have in the smaller in [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1417.36s)]
*  companies like startups you know that by definition you know innovation in smaller companies like [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1423.6s)]
*  startups and and you have exceptions like google and you know and and maybe like meta but [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1430.0s)]
*  they are still you know the pharma is a bit more complex because they have a lot of capex they have [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1437.04s)]
*  a lot of like they need a lot of equipment there are a lot of labs a lot of operations are around [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1443.2s)]
*  that and i think they just partner with like companies that are ready to operate plus as we [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1447.28s)]
*  mentioned before there are so many topics ai can be applied in in the field of like you know [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1455.36s)]
*  pharmaceutical in general or drug design in particular and it can cover everything right so [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1459.84s)]
*  they're just like they come to us because they say okay you guys are specialized in genomic medicine [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1465.52s)]
*  you understand our challenges we we know exactly what they need we know what they're trying to [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1470.9599999999998s)]
*  achieve so we come with something that's ready to operate and so they gain a lot of time and efficiency [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1476.24s)]
*  What about on the moving away from from the design and the target id what about when it comes to [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1482.8000000000002s)]
*  manufacturing i mean you guys were named a manufacturing tech disruptor at advanced [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1488.5600000000002s)]
*  therapies week talk to me a little bit about manufacturing how is ai reshaping this side of [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1493.92s)]
*  biotech yeah very good question actually it's very interesting we have discussions as well with some [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1499.2800000000002s)]
*  companies in the field and we recently contracted with one of big [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1507.2s)]
*  company in the field of equipment for for bioproduction and manufacturing [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1511.92s)]
*  you know again it's a question of efficiency and data driven decision making so basically [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1520.96s)]
*  in bio manufacturing there are a lot of different steps there are a lot of it's it's still like a [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1529.04s)]
*  not super efficient the other yield to produce viral vectors or you know is not good so what you [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1536.72s)]
*  need to do first is understand why because when it's not good it means it costs money that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1546.72s)]
*  eventually you will be able to produce them it takes time and it's not efficient so it costs more [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1551.12s)]
*  and it's not efficient so it costs more money and then it's reflected again in the in the price of [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1555.2s)]
*  the therapy at the end so what we do for those companies or like what ai can do is really like [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1561.3600000000001s)]
*  you know there's actually a lot of data available you need to understand you know the data available [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1566.64s)]
*  what how you analyze it how you find root cause that impacts the whole process which is a complex [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1572.4s)]
*  process because it has like both like biological components and then has like pure like process data [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1580.48s)]
*  you know like and and and physical you know like measures from different equipments and so you need [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1586.0s)]
*  to make sense of that and we we work on some processes on antiviruses bioproduction actually [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1593.76s)]
*  and we really improve the yield and so it shows that you can have you know ai analysis again when [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1599.68s)]
*  you have a lot of data ai is super super good at analyzing data and like and training algorithm [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1606.48s)]
*  to improve the process so that's what we've done with uh with those projects is there a a place [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1612.56s)]
*  for ai somewhere between the design and discovery and the manufacturing does it make the handoff [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1619.92s)]
*  any smoother are there ways it can help operationally too yeah it's a very good question [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1625.52s)]
*  we actually i'm going to give a simple example but we have a we're already impacting the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1631.68s)]
*  bio manufacturing by in the drug design so if in our field we there's the in the you know in the [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1636.72s)]
*  genomic medicine field there is a need to have good vectors you know like the viral vectors are [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1644.72s)]
*  going to transport the dna or rna this is a major bottleneck today in the industry and so to design [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1650.64s)]
*  you can design a great vector that's going to be very specific to its target that's great [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1658.64s)]
*  but if you've designed this vector and you're not able to produce it then you failed so we work on [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  you know adding components like molecular components in the construct so and we use ai [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1671.5200000000002s)]
*  to predict and we have actually a poster and uh and and an approach that we patented you know [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1679.5200000000002s)]
*  um like is this vector going to be manufacturable is are we going to be able to is it later going [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1685.84s)]
*  to be able to be produced and exist per se or with just like a so you know so we if you add [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1694.0s)]
*  this component into the ai system and you predict this as like high chances of being viable then [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1700.48s)]
*  it will be reflected into the bio production process because then when you know the chances [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1707.68s)]
*  will be that oh i'm able to produce those vectors so this is how we impact from drug design into [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1713.12s)]
*  bio production let's uh let's look ahead a little bit here where do you think ai is going to be [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1718.96s)]
*  taking biotech the places that we haven't seen yet i mean all of these things we're talking about [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1725.84s)]
*  we're already seeing that impact where where is it going where are you betting on it being in [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1730.08s)]
*  sort of that five to ten year horizon [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1734.3999999999999s)]
*  yeah i think [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1740.56s)]
*  the the improvements today are still incremental uh and the next step is to show you're able to [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1743.9199999999998s)]
*  design a drug that's ai guided i would say and it's validated in clinical trials in record times [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1752.96s)]
*  you know i think that's you know in the end that's what you want to achieve right you want to achieve [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1765.04s)]
*  like safer and better drugs for patients but you don't have to like wait 15 years to see them in [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1770.4s)]
*  the market you know you want to you want to see them in three years you know in the market of [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1778.0s)]
*  course you're going to have to do what is right with the regulatory uh you know bodies of course [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1783.52s)]
*  and and it still needs to be like that but you we need to speed up those drugs you know can save [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1788.72s)]
*  lives and patients need them and and so you need to like boost the capacity to produce those drugs [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1795.36s)]
*  in record times we've seen it with covid we know it's possible it was not a drug was a vaccine but [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1804.0s)]
*  before vaccine before that vaccine took 10 years to be you know to be approved and developed and [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1810.8s)]
*  approved so i think when there is a general there is a technological capacity you know today to do [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1815.44s)]
*  it and then there is general like interest to like produce drugs faster and and you know like for the [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1823.92s)]
*  whole you know population i think this is what we want to achieve and what you you can foresee [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1829.36s)]
*  hopefully in the next five to ten years i think that covid example is a is a really good one [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1835.9199999999998s)]
*  because we just decided that we could do it we decided that we would work with regulators work [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1841.76s)]
*  with companies working biotechs and and it got done in record time is there a place for ai on [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1846.8s)]
*  the regulatory side to you know advance things and accelerate things on that side [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1852.56s)]
*  well i think i think regulators are going to be convinced again by by i would say biological data [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1859.36s)]
*  uh maybe maybe at some point i think where ai can also like maybe need to be also the impact of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1871.52s)]
*  regulation is you know we're still using animal models like nh like non-human primates to validate [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  like nh like non-human primates to validate some some drugs which is the standard and you know [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1884.3999999999999s)]
*  if at some point we are able to you know go into human trials with less animal models i think it's [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1890.8799999999999s)]
*  a probably a challenge right but with like organoids models for example and things like that that are [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1899.9199999999998s)]
*  will prevent using animals in pre-clinical trials i think that that would be great that could be [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1906.72s)]
*  some topic interesting probably discussed with regulate regulation regulatory bodies [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1911.92s)]
*  but yeah again you know regulatory bodies their their role is to make sure the drug is safe [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1918.3200000000002s)]
*  for for for patients in clinical trials as well and so it's uh yeah it's it's an important decision [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1923.04s)]
*  i think ai can help in regulation for sure and i'm not a regulatory expert but i'm sure there [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1930.5600000000002s)]
*  are a lot of initiatives in ai and regulation at the fda or like the ema yeah we're we're already [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1936.4s)]
*  talking about generative ai machine learning these are quite established ai technologies [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1944.5600000000002s)]
*  are there there are other things that are emerging though tools and techniques things like [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1951.0400000000002s)]
*  protein language models or other things that are going to come to dominate the field in the years [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  ahead yeah um [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1960.88s)]
*  definitely protein language model as you mentioned we use it uh we have developed our own plm uh dna [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1969.0400000000002s)]
*  language model as well rna language model so i think the models for like designing genetic sequences [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1978.48s)]
*  uh proteins uh are important they are game changer in the field there are still a lot of work to be [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1985.2s)]
*  done uh they are less mature than lms which is fine i mean it's great uh you know lms is helping [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  on other topics and it's great uh yeah so i think you mentioned for us the great example of protein [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=1999.04s)]
*  language model uh and uh i would say like we had deep learning generative ai you know also related [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  to to protein predictions um so i think yeah i think the field of proteins uh there a lot has [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2013.92s)]
*  been done uh it's amazing to see the progress and there are lots can would still be uh be done in [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2023.92s)]
*  the next couple of years uh so there are a lot of possibilities that are still coming in the field [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2030.16s)]
*  of ai and innovation maybe i'm being a bit unfair here because uh sort of a 10-year window if we went [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2037.6000000000001s)]
*  back in time 10 years uh 2015 you you probably weren't thinking about uh these sorts of things [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2043.9199999999998s)]
*  at all or at least the possibilities there is 10 years too much of a window too big a window for ai [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2050.24s)]
*  i think so yeah i think so i think it's uh the pace of innovation of the eyes been just amazing [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2058.0s)]
*  in the past couple of years you see you know and it's also because it's highly financed uh which [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2064.48s)]
*  is great uh i think i look at ai with a shorter window frame right i would say it depends what we [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2070.32s)]
*  want to set at the end point right but the impact of like innovation of a eyes every six months [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2079.84s)]
*  right now you know so i mean they're like the new lama model that just came out and you know and [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2086.88s)]
*  there will be new alpha for the model and it will be better and better and this whole ecosystem [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2092.0s)]
*  actually uh going upwards you know it's like helping basically helping the industry to get [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2097.04s)]
*  better and better with more like fundamental biologic models uh and also helping us where [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2103.92s)]
*  we have more like applied with like a real application it's like not fundamental it's like [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2110.72s)]
*  applied to designing new therapies uh it goes fast which is great for us from white labs perspective [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2115.12s)]
*  what's the next big challenge that ai has to tackle maybe something that that's already in your [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2123.12s)]
*  roadmap well i think for us again will be ai a drug like there's been designed by our ai that [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2127.92s)]
*  that hits clinical milestones this is our next you know this we're not taking this is not us [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2142.88s)]
*  we're not going into clinical trials ourselves we're a tech biocompany so not biotech but our [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2150.16s)]
*  partner you know like a pharma company or talking discussing with taking the drug we designed [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2155.52s)]
*  into clinical trials show it's successful uh that would be that that's what we want to see next for [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2162.3199999999997s)]
*  white lab and just a final thought if you had to pitch uh the future of ai and biotech to someone [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2168.48s)]
*  who was really skeptical of ai in general maybe they've had a bad experience already or a large [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2176.4s)]
*  language model you know got them in trouble with their boss you know what's the one thing you'd [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2182.64s)]
*  say to that sort of person to convince them that ai and biotech really is a game changer [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2186.96s)]
*  you know uh i started white lab in 2019 in france and i can tell you i i talked to a lot of skeptical [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2195.76s)]
*  people you know because ai was not that uh well understood back then i would say something you [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2204.0s)]
*  know i will go back to my life in the medical imaging you know i remember in 2000 around 2000 [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2213.28s)]
*  there was uh in imaging a software uh working on the software to do like computed ad diagnostic [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2221.84s)]
*  c.a.d which is you know premises of ai you know like how the software is going to have the [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2232.5600000000004s)]
*  radiologists to like detect better you know uh potential lesions potential like tumors [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2238.48s)]
*  you know and there was such a pushback that people like were so negative no this is [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  too scary or too risky just to leave it to the computer it basically gives you more information [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2251.28s)]
*  so today it's not even a question anymore right so today the radiologists they use ai [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2257.68s)]
*  to just do their you know to confirm their diagnostics there is no question whatsoever but [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2264.24s)]
*  25 years ago the pushback was really strong and it took the industry that long to actually make [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2270.8799999999997s)]
*  it accepted i think it was a waste of opportunity so i would say you know why don't you give it the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2277.3599999999997s)]
*  benefit of the doubt try it you can be deceived you can be disappointed but you know don't don't [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2283.12s)]
*  waste the opportunity because you know it's 20 years to get like ai for radiology to be more [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2290.72s)]
*  accepted or totally accepted but it's a waste of 20 years because it was there 20 years ago and [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2297.7599999999998s)]
*  some different way but not that's so different not that different and same for like ai in biotech [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2303.8399999999997s)]
*  right give it the benefit of the doubt it's been actually proven with like the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2308.7999999999997s)]
*  modern approach to mrna design in record times in the end it will benefit everyone [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2313.04s)]
*  and i think there are less skeptical people today people are using gpt and see what you can do and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2322.0s)]
*  other ai tools to design cars and you know it's kind of everywhere today i think i think yeah [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2328.9599999999996s)]
*  that's what i would tell them give it the benefit of the doubt perfect david thanks for joining [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2336.72s)]
*  us today on beyond biotech thank you delan thank you for having me [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyOpNKi-QA&t=2342.3999999999996s)]
