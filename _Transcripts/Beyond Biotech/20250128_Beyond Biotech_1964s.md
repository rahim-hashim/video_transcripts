# Epic Bio - gene editing without cutting DNA
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 79. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTech. And this week we have a conversation with one of the pioneers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=16.52s)]
*  of CRISPR about his company which is taking a novel approach to treating disease. Stanley [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=22.76s)]
*  Chi was one of the original inventors of CRISPR at UC Berkeley and one of those who published the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=29.56s)]
*  first paper on CRISPR interference in February 2013. That seems almost a lifetime ago in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=36.4s)]
*  world of research and now Dr. Chi is the founder of Epic Bio and that is a company pioneering [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=43.98s)]
*  epigenetic editing. Before we get to what epigenetic editing is I would normally ask for some background [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=51.0s)]
*  on the company. However this time that's not how the conversation started. You've had a very [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=57.84s)]
*  interesting career to this date so I wonder if maybe to start you could tell me a little bit [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=64.2s)]
*  about some of the things that you've done so far in the biotech field. Yeah sure I'm currently an [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=70.92s)]
*  associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford University and my primary research direction is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=77.44s)]
*  to get better technologies and tools that we could use to modify and control the human genome [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=83.96s)]
*  beyond gene editing. And besides using these tools for research we have a big goal to translate some [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  of these tools into the therapeutic domain such as new gene therapy or cell therapy for disease [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  that really demands a new technology. For my training background I originally got my PhD from [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=106.16s)]
*  UC Berkeley in bioengineering. However even before that I was trained as a philicist and I have been [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=115.08s)]
*  working on synthetic biology and biofuel production and methods on that for a couple years before I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=122.44s)]
*  transitioned my attention fully onto tackling the technologies and the treatments for the human [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=130.76s)]
*  disease. And after my PhD at Berkeley I also worked for a few years at UCSF as an independent [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=137.72s)]
*  fellow and there we co-developed technologies like NucleusDAD, DCAS9 and CRISPR-i, CRISPR-a and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=145.04s)]
*  then after I moved my lab to Stanford we've been very much focused on thinking how we could use [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=153.76s)]
*  these technologies to treat disease and we have particular focus on the human epigenome such as [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  the epigenetic editing. Is that what led to the formation of EPIC bio? Oh yes so we've been working [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=168.0s)]
*  in this domain for more than decades and it all started with the need, the huge needs that the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=178.24s)]
*  question is how can we precisely modify or control the human genome and CRISPR technology came out [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=186.24s)]
*  right got inspired it was originally discovered as a bacteria's genetic immune system used by [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=195.6s)]
*  bacteria cells to fight their viruses like bacteriophages it has super high potential for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=202.4s)]
*  precision that really excited me so we've been working on polishing the tools in the lab and many [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=210.0s)]
*  of our papers being published on top journals but meanwhile the technology is being filed as patents [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  and then as we shifting more and more focus onto the translational side I do I realized there is a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=224.44s)]
*  huge need to translate these tools outside of the lab and while the research lab itself is not [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=231.36s)]
*  sufficient to provide a full spectrum for testing them in human and also develop them as a real [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=239.0s)]
*  product to the real world and that therefore we've been talking to the people and the investors and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=246.8s)]
*  the supporters there is a big support to say okay so let's try to license all the technology into a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=255.24s)]
*  new startup which is EPIC bio which was founded in 2019 and supported by Horizon Ventures and by [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=261.24s)]
*  the way also Horizon Ventures being and the McCushing Foundation being a long-term supporter [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=269.8s)]
*  to my research in the lab so they very well familiar with everything going on on the technology [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=274.64s)]
*  advancement side and I get a huge amount of support from them and I should also mention [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=280.04s)]
*  in the meantime we almost every other week we got an email from a stranger a patient either [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=286.72s)]
*  is them is there like children their parents or their friends they got a rare disease they read [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=292.68s)]
*  news about our technology and they ask oh when your technology could be accessed by patients we [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=299.04s)]
*  did feel there is a demand for doing this timeline to benefit the society. CRISPR has obviously been [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=305.64s)]
*  around for a while now could you tell me about some of the things like CRISPR interference in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=313.12s)]
*  the epigenome and epigenetic editing could you explain what those all are? Yeah like you said [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=320.68s)]
*  CRISPR feels both old and new to people first I should say why it feels old because it's the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=327.24s)]
*  technology was reported a decade ago and decades seems a long time in the in the tech world right [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=335.16s)]
*  and meanwhile it feels new because the first CRISPR drug was approved a month ago and just [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=342.72s)]
*  yesterday I saw the news that it's expanded the disease scope from the first drug further from [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=348.56s)]
*  sickle cell anemia to beta-settlcemia which is very exciting but if you consider how this drug [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=356.56s)]
*  going from testing in the cell cultures in the lab to be approved as a drug in patients it took [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=363.12s)]
*  like less than 12 years I think that's extremely fast for a drug development perspective but [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=372.16s)]
*  meanwhile we've been working on this very different spectrum of the CRISPR which is we do not focus on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=378.92s)]
*  gene editing CRISPR came out from as a nucleus molecule and it's an already guided DNA cutting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=386.48s)]
*  molecule we call it nucleus it allows us to cut the DNA and modify the sequence that on that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=393.6s)]
*  particular site of the DNA and however since day one what our inspiration from this CRISPR is less [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  about this cutting ability if I make a metaphor I will say okay CRISPR is a very precise scissors [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=409.84s)]
*  right that allow us to do gene surgery on the genome we are less inspired by the Caesar function [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=417.24s)]
*  we are more inspired by precision function and based on this we thought okay how can we harness [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  this precision because it allows us to use a RA to target any piece of DNA and then to control the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=430.52s)]
*  function come out from the piece of DNA that really leads to two inventions one is this nucleus [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=438.08s)]
*  dead cast we name it dcast d stands for dead so dcast 9 dcast 12 dcast mini like miniature casts [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=444.12s)]
*  that we developed and also second technology is leading to this control technology which is we [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=451.88s)]
*  named CRISPR-i CRISPR inference for silencing a gene or CRISPR-a for activating a gene and that's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=458.36s)]
*  being said this leads to like expanding the gene editing from altering gene sequence into modifying [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  the human epigenetics okay your question is what is the human epigenome the epigenome is the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=473.2s)]
*  chemistry of the DNA that controls gene expression by chemistry it could be broadly defined but I can [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  give you one most well started example is gene methylation for example like we there are a lot [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=488.16s)]
*  of studies shown that if a gene region consider human genome is associated it's like modified [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  heavily by gene methylation that usually leads to silencing of that gene sometimes even permanent [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=501.44s)]
*  silencing when the cells divide this methylation marks also inherited by daughter cells it does [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=506.88000000000005s)]
*  keep silencing the genes in the daughter cells but if a piece of gene is depleted of the methylation [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=512.1600000000001s)]
*  it's usually associated with gene activation gene on so it's really like this chemistry is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=518.4s)]
*  fascinating because the controls the fate of the DNA how the DNA expressed when they are expressed [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=524.48s)]
*  and when something goes wrong there with the chemistry they definitely lead to disease that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=531.04s)]
*  really leads to what we want let's make tools for modifying epigenome which are called epigenetic [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  editing and we want to be very safely and very precisely to modify such chemistry marks such as [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=542.96s)]
*  installing new methylation marks to silencing permanently or we erase the marks to turn on the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=549.52s)]
*  gene promptly and I believe all this would find their potential uses for disease treatment [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=556.48s)]
*  could you tell me a bit about your gems or gene expression modulation system yes and the core [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  component of our technologies so we can precisely modify the human genetics relies on two components [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=571.84s)]
*  one component is a precision molecule we invented a miniature cast system which is only a third size [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=580.0s)]
*  of cast nine and which makes it much easier to deliver into the cells or into the body [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=587.84s)]
*  and the second component which is a piece of a protein which is actually an enzyme [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=594.64s)]
*  that either come from the natural human of human proteins or is being engineered to further improve [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=600.96s)]
*  the activity what does this enzyme do okay this enzyme it will modify the chemistry on the DNA or [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=607.84s)]
*  histone or histone associated with DNA so we can influence how the genes are turned on or turned off [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=614.32s)]
*  and normally we we call it gene expression modulation because despite it being an epigenetic [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=622.24s)]
*  enzyme such as being modifying the methylation marks or certain units or the histone or it's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=628.32s)]
*  being a methyl transferase or demethylase we think the outcome is to modify gene expression [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=635.36s)]
*  right we can turn on or switch on or switch off the expression therefore we name it gene [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=640.88s)]
*  expression modulation or gems one of the good things about this system is that the editing [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=645.12s)]
*  is reversible how do you reverse that and why would you need to do that yeah that's a fantastic [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=650.48s)]
*  question so i've been thinking about this question for a long time even since the beginning of the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=658.0s)]
*  technology so if we think about the gene editing we talk about modifying the sequence such as by [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=663.6s)]
*  converting a single base pair a to a g example or disrupting a gene by deleting a fragment from [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=670.08s)]
*  this gene and all these modifications are considered irreversible it's not saying that it's [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=677.12s)]
*  absolutely impossible to reverse that but in the normal clinical setup it's irreversible [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=684.9599999999999s)]
*  being irreversible brings the good thing about it could be a one-time treatment but it also bears [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=690.88s)]
*  a big risk which is if these irreversible modifications occur outside of your gene or [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=698.16s)]
*  interest on another side which we call it off target if this such thing happens it will be [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=704.64s)]
*  very hard to remedy that and in comparison to these permanent DNA sequence modification changes [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=710.48s)]
*  we are very excited about epigenetics because epigenetics by intrinsic design either from nature [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=718.72s)]
*  or from our technology is reversible because think about the chemistry on the DNA it's all [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=725.2s)]
*  being introduced and erased for every single modification like a denomization there is a [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=732.16s)]
*  rider meanwhile there is an eraser and it's kind of like a whiteboard right so you can you can write [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=738.24s)]
*  something there but you can also erase that when you don't need it that really brings up a safety [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=744.64s)]
*  and also the flexibility because sometimes if we like say at this moment we need to turn on this [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=750.8s)]
*  gene but later we need to turn them off because we no longer need this modification i think the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=756.4s)]
*  very exciting potential here is yes we can do it we've seen what CRISPR can do in terms of how it [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=762.72s)]
*  treats diseases what are the implications of your system in terms of how will it advance treatments [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=770.08s)]
*  yes i have this recognition that is epigenetic editing is the next pillar of the gene editing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  and gene therapy and what excites me most is it expands the scope of the gene editing to treat [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=787.36s)]
*  more disease that beyond simply editing the DNA sequence and why do i see that and considering [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=794.56s)]
*  the current disease that's being very actively like tackled in the domain of the gene editing [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  they mostly belong to single mutation disease for example the first CRISPR drug addresses [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=807.04s)]
*  sickle cellemia beta cellosemia and there are also CRISPR companies working on liver disease [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=812.56s)]
*  and many of these disease are caused by a single mutation in a single gene and while this is [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=820.56s)]
*  already super exciting because many of these disease do not yet have a treatment and also [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=826.4799999999999s)]
*  gene editing brings in a cure not just a treatment and we do recognize the disease scope that could [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  be tackled by gene editing is relatively limited at the moment and i feel it's a pity that we have [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=838.88s)]
*  such wonderful technology and tools but we can only address a small category of disease and by the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=845.6s)]
*  way many of these diseases are rare disease and but when we look at the broader disease category [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  we realized more than 40 percent of the disease are related to human DNA changes either genetic [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=856.64s)]
*  or epigenetic actually i should say this number keep increasing because the more people started [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=863.28s)]
*  into the mechanism of the root of the disease they realize oh more could be addressed definitely by [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=869.6s)]
*  genetics or epigenetic so 40 percent is an under estimation and the furthermore and even in the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=875.28s)]
*  realm of the rare of the genetic disease there are like more than 8000 of them and many of them are [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=881.36s)]
*  regarded as orphaned disease because they only affect a small population but you time that number [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=887.36s)]
*  by a thousand it actually affects six percent of the global population which is a significant [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=893.92s)]
*  category of disease and while gene editing can only address a smaller population of patients [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=899.28s)]
*  we ask questions can we use epigenetic editing technologies to dramatically broaden it i can give [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  you some examples gene editing the concept of that is if there is a mutation we can target to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=913.04s)]
*  the region that bearing that mutation and precisely either disrupt the mutation or correct the mutation [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=920.88s)]
*  however that really leads to some challenges for certain disease for example cystic fibrosis is a [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=928.16s)]
*  disease that caught by one gene but there are more than 2000 possible mutations spread across the gene [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=934.7199999999999s)]
*  and while there are some dominant mutations sure in the in this patient population but so many [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=942.24s)]
*  mutations in that disease only how a few hundred patients in the world with that mutation that's [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=947.52s)]
*  broad question like are we going to develop a different modality just to treat a hundred people [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=953.52s)]
*  and how can we design the clinical trial for that right and is this even commercially feasible and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=960.64s)]
*  when we think about that we think okay like if we can use epigenetic editing we can make it [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  mutation agnostic saying sure there are a few hundred patients for each mutation but there are [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=971.92s)]
*  2000 mutations but it's caused by one single gene it's a one gene disease what about we use [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  epigenetic editing to either reactivating the gene function or silencing the gene function then we [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  don't need to develop like so many different modalities for individual mutations we can design [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=990.24s)]
*  one modality targeting to a region that is common to all the people and let this our enzyme the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=996.96s)]
*  epigenetic enzyme introduce the chemistry right methylation or demycelation in marks into the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1004.32s)]
*  into the chromatin and then we can treat the disease that is the reason that we definitely [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1011.52s)]
*  think the epigenetic editing bear huge benefits to expand the scope of treatment i'm just giving [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1016.96s)]
*  one example by the way there are actually many categories of disease caused by like for example [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1022.96s)]
*  repeat expansion which means a sequence being repeated multiple times in the genome which leads [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1028.72s)]
*  to a problem that is very hard to be addressed by gene editing but could be great targets for [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1034.16s)]
*  epigenetic editing and another big category is haploin sufficiency disease and haploin means half [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1039.76s)]
*  okay so basically means in our body like there is a gene cause problem but half of the allele of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1046.72s)]
*  the gene which is one copy allele is good but another copy is bad is diseased so we can use [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1052.88s)]
*  epigenetic editing to reactivate the good allele to restore the good dosage like rat syndrome and a [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1058.16s)]
*  bunch of like obesity related disease are caused by this type of root of the disease so i'm just [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1064.32s)]
*  giving you a very small category of the disease that we believe we can expand to but there are [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1071.12s)]
*  many more we we really like suitable for epigenetic editing this seems like there's so many different [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1076.9599999999998s)]
*  things that you can do here is it overwhelming i know that you're going to focus on an fshd but [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1083.04s)]
*  in the bigger picture how will you try and tackle all of these conditions this is great [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1089.28s)]
*  great question we always keep ourselves busy i wouldn't say it's 24 7 working but we always [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1096.96s)]
*  working but meanwhile like you said there are so many potentials there are so many challenges as [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1102.24s)]
*  well each disease it could be very hard right because there are some specific to each disease [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1107.8400000000001s)]
*  our strategy is to first approve that the our technology is could be safe in human it's pretty [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  much like for gene editing right so there it also has huge potential to many category disease and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1119.76s)]
*  people start with some disease that has a demand medical need but also feasible and also have a [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1125.6s)]
*  clear clinical path to demonstrate its efficacy and safety in human and we are doing the same [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1132.8799999999999s)]
*  thing here for epigenetic editing so that's why we we focus a lot of efforts on fshd we have two [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1138.48s)]
*  goals one here and one is to really find a treatment to fshd because there is a big medical need [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1146.8s)]
*  second is to demonstrate the epigenome editing is safe and has efficacy and okay so another reason [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1152.88s)]
*  is okay why do you choose fshd right so fshd is a common form of muscular dystrophy it's actually [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1160.16s)]
*  the second largest muscular dystrophy it's actually a genetic condition characterized by progressive [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1166.88s)]
*  chronic muscle weakness and atrophy and specifically fshd stands for fascial scapular [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1173.2800000000002s)]
*  humeral muscular dystrophy it affects face shoulders and upper arms but unlike duchenne muscular [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1180.72s)]
*  dystrophy is uh very is greatly in severity and also many people experiencing ranging from mild [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1186.8s)]
*  to severe symptoms and making is uh people regard as a most sophisticated physical like a disease [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1194.56s)]
*  but then there are some complexities that which we believe is perfect for epigenome editing because [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  it's caused by an inappropriate expression of a gene called dux 4 in muscle cells and it furthermore [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1207.6s)]
*  is related to the copy duplication of this dux 4 and normally this gene is silenced in many tissues [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1214.9599999999998s)]
*  including muscles however in individuals with fshd there are some genetic changes or epigenetic [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1222.24s)]
*  changes there are different types or fshd really leads to a variant expression of dux 4 which [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1228.9599999999998s)]
*  gradually weakens the muscle cell leading to cell death it's traditionally hard to for gene editing [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1234.08s)]
*  to tackle this disease because it's related to many copies of the dux 4 in the genome and it's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1240.08s)]
*  very hard to damage the genome at so many sites and fix the problem there but using epigenome editing [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1245.6s)]
*  we can re-silence the disease-causing genes and regardless of their copy numbers and also we can [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1251.6s)]
*  use the advances from already come from the duchenne muscular dystrophy like a viral vector [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1260.0s)]
*  to address this disease that's that therefore we believe we have all the necessary molecular modalities [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  prepared us to try it in animals and in patients and we choose this as our beginning point and we [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1272.16s)]
*  after we verify the safety we are expanding them to other disease and how will your platform tackle [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1279.44s)]
*  the disease the epi321? Yeah epi321 is a codename for our current epigenetic drug to treat this [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1286.8s)]
*  what is that it's a molecule it encodes a molecule which is like i described it's a fusion molecule [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1295.2s)]
*  between a miniature cast model system fused with a epigenetic enzyme which allow us to silence [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1301.12s)]
*  the dux 4 gene by installing the methylation into the chromatin it's supposed to be a one-time [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1309.2s)]
*  treatment and the permanent cure of the disease and what's in it is we use a viral vector a [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1315.12s)]
*  then associate virus a way to encode a gene that encodes this fusion protein and we also [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1321.36s)]
*  co-express a guide RNA that specifically directs this molecule onto the site of dux 4 gene and so [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  we can make this very precise and that is the form of what epi321 meanwhile this vector the [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1335.52s)]
*  the system has been for delivery has been wildly validated models like primates and used for other [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1344.08s)]
*  muscular disease that therefore we believe we are at a very interesting prime moment to combine [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1352.24s)]
*  the existing technologies with our new epigenome editing technology to tackle this disease. Could [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1359.12s)]
*  you tell me a little bit about the plans for the clinical trial? So we built the clinical trial we [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1365.9199999999998s)]
*  are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy and also optimize dosing of our therapeutic [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1372.48s)]
*  approach so our hope is to initiate the fifth one clinical trial with those focus and goals [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1378.64s)]
*  bearing in mind because it's a new type of epigenome editing so we need to there are a few things that [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  we need to do one is to verify this mode of action which is a relatively new mode of action [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1391.76s)]
*  but meanwhile since the gene therapy being rapidly progressing like CRISPR being used [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1397.68s)]
*  as a drug for genetic disease mutation, correct mutation, gene disruption and we all use [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1402.96s)]
*  similar technologies that invented there but also blend in with new methods to particularly focus [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  on epigenetics such as sequencing methods to sequence the off targets and verify the off target [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1415.68s)]
*  modifications and in this patient to verify the mode of action and meanwhile and we will focus on [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1422.56s)]
*  the administration because the method of administering the treatment is very important [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1429.52s)]
*  for this FSHD we need to optimize that as a gene therapy we will optimize like intramuscular [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1436.0s)]
*  injections of our viral vector and we will investigate what is the dose required and how to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1443.6s)]
*  get the best method of this gene editing epigenome editing molecule into the cells as much as possible [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  there are a lot of treatments that cost an awful lot of money is this something that you will be [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1457.92s)]
*  able to do at a reasonable cost in terms of the R&D research that's why we work diligently with [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1462.96s)]
*  investors and also other biotech and the pharma companies to investigate this disease that's [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1471.92s)]
*  already been demanding a big amount of capital to support the whole process of this clinical trial [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1478.24s)]
*  and and maybe recognized by many supporters so i'll be confident about that and meanwhile if you [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1485.28s)]
*  talk about the cost after this drug being developed i do expect yeah like many gene therapies the cost [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1492.08s)]
*  could be high at the beginning because there is a smaller group of patients suitable for this disease [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1498.56s)]
*  and also all the manufacture and other costs come into it is high but just kind of like any other [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  technology many technologies right it's usually started as a luxury product and gradually because [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1512.72s)]
*  of the customer base goes up because we can treat more patients in this case and the manufacturer [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  cost goes down the skill up goes up so we can start greatly reduce the cost i believe the next [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1524.56s)]
*  few decades of medicine will be dramatically different and people will no longer feel strange [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1532.48s)]
*  to talk about gene therapy and there is no reason for gene therapy to be as expensive as today i [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1538.96s)]
*  actually believe there will be others magnitude lower cost in the future for these medicines [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1545.28s)]
*  that's excellent is this an area that there's just your company working on or are there other [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1551.04s)]
*  companies working in this field so there are a few other companies also working on this precision [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1556.48s)]
*  epigenetic editing and but if you look at broadly on the epigenetics companies even before the age [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1563.76s)]
*  of CRISPR there were company working on epigenetic to treat cancer right so all like this is as [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1571.2s)]
*  you're also people working on epigenetics to engineer stem cells at cell therapy or to do [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1577.44s)]
*  anti-aging they're very active research on that and those epigenetics research companies also being [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  like in the world right so they are doing their great job and for us we focus on precise epigenome [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1592.24s)]
*  editing and besides epic bios there are other companies like chromatune and they also in [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  developing technologies and addressing disease and because there are many diseases really in this [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1606.48s)]
*  field i'm super excited to see more than one company working on this right because really [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1612.16s)]
*  speaking from both technology side and also speaking from the disease indication side [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1618.72s)]
*  i'm happy to see the technology is being developed by multiple parties and optimized differently for [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1624.5600000000002s)]
*  different disease and the hope is to bring these biotechnology advances onto the hands of patients [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1631.28s)]
*  as soon as possible what else do you have in your pipeline that you're working on yeah besides fshd [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1637.12s)]
*  which is a muscular dystrophy disease we also have pipelines about the liver disease and including [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1644.2399999999998s)]
*  both genetic disease of the genetic liver disease and also infectious type of liver disease and we [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1651.12s)]
*  also have a pipeline regarding the resin disease which also very amenable for the a-web type [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1657.28s)]
*  delivery oh by the way for liver disease we do use a mra therapy we use mra to encode our epigenome [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1663.52s)]
*  adding molecule and we package that in lipid nanoparticles like lmp which has been used as [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1671.28s)]
*  vaccines and many other drug development and we are very excited about that and beyond these [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1677.84s)]
*  categories i'm personally very excited about neurological disease and neurological disease [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1683.52s)]
*  there are so many of them and most of them have no cure at all and but they're the big demand and [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1688.96s)]
*  it's been traditionally challenging because of the lack of the effective genetic molecules to modify [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  the genetics in the neurons and also because of lack of delivery methods to particularly deliver [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1700.48s)]
*  into the brain or into the spine and but i believe we are starting at the moment to use the epigenome [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1706.08s)]
*  editing to modify the neurons such as treating rat syndrome indomitance syndrome and other type [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1712.96s)]
*  of genetic disease like even auto mean like multiple sclerosis and you know another reason [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1720.32s)]
*  i really like from biological side i very interested in neurological disease is these are the type of [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1726.32s)]
*  cells that neurons like super important and also do not divide at all and live with us forever if [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1732.08s)]
*  we lose them we lose them that really like match to the concept of epigenetics which is you talk [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1739.76s)]
*  about not a cell divide and you talk about how to reinstall some chemistry into a existing cell to [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1746.56s)]
*  regulate their gene expression so we can reverse disease so yeah i'm excited about all these [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1755.2s)]
*  disease but also i hope there would be more options for us to modify the epigenetic in these diseases [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1760.48s)]
*  so where does the company go from here i know you've been extremely busy lately so [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1766.88s)]
*  what are the next steps yes number one priority is for us to bring our first epigenetic editing drug [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1771.3600000000001s)]
*  into the clinics and prove it safe and prove it efficient we are working very diligently on [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1779.5200000000002s)]
*  this major task and meanwhile we also continuously innovating our epigenetic platform epic bio is both [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1785.2s)]
*  a platform technology company and also a gene therapy company and we aim to address the most [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1793.52s)]
*  challenging disease that not addressed by gene editing but meanwhile we are providing a broad [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  technology based on epigenetic editing and for example we have a pipeline for protein engineering [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1807.36s)]
*  and screening and we also have much like artificial intelligence discovery pipeline in the company to [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1813.76s)]
*  discover and engineer and optimize all these epigenetic editing molecules and these technologies [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  are broadly useful even beyond the gene therapy field for example cancer treatment and like car [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1828.96s)]
*  t and t-cell therapy has been successful right in treating some type of tumors like blood tumors [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  but meanwhile there is a big need to expand beyond blood tumor and we do believe epigenetic editing [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1842.3999999999999s)]
*  in t-cells in other type of immune cells like macrophage and natural killer cells will be a key [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1847.76s)]
*  to optimize their efficacy to all different type of cancer and beyond cancer like stem cell therapy [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1854.4s)]
*  regarding how you can engineer the epigenetics of the stem cell to make them differentiate into [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1860.96s)]
*  most therapeutic relevant cells and or like more common disease like a joint disease a heart disease [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1866.96s)]
*  cardiovascular disease neurological disease all of them will require the advantage from epigenetic [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1873.6s)]
*  we are actually working with different industry partners to open our platform and use them for [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1880.16s)]
*  different disease categories and even in the longer future people talk about oh how can we [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1886.48s)]
*  help because a lot of diseases are age-related how can we address this age-related disease [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1891.84s)]
*  and we do believe many age-related disease are relevant to epigenetics because in many of those [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1896.16s)]
*  diseases you do not obviously see mutation but you see changes in epigenetics and we are also [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1901.44s)]
*  interested in potentially in those categories it keep us very busy there are a lot of opportunities [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1907.44s)]
*  a lot of potentials but we also recognize the number one priority is to bring this to treat [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1912.56s)]
*  at least one disease not only fascinating science but also a very promising way to treat certain [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1917.44s)]
*  diseases i think with so many advancements in science and the influence of ai the next few [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1927.6s)]
*  years promise to be very interesting don't forget to check out the latest news and articles at [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1934.24s)]
*  the biotech.eu and i hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1940.6399999999999s)]
*  thanks for listening and i hope you'll join us next time for another beyond biotech [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvQ-3-xM3I&t=1946.32s)]
