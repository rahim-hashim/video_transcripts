# Reformulating psychedelics for neurodegenerative diseases
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 87. I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. There's a clear demand for novel neurological treatments. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=16.48s)]
*  While it's widely known psychedelics hold quite a lot of therapeutic potential, there are challenges. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=24.36s)]
*  Our guest this week is Dr. Sam Clark, who founded Terran Biosciences to develop a safe, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=31.28s)]
*  effective portfolio of therapeutics and technologies for patients with neurological [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=39.12s)]
*  and psychiatric diseases. And I first asked Sam for an introduction to the company itself. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=45.2s)]
*  Terran is a biotech platform company that I founded back when I was finishing up med school. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=51.559999999999995s)]
*  I can tell you a little bit about myself. So I did my undergrad degree in neuroscience at MIT, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=58.8s)]
*  and then I did my MD and my PhD at Columbia. Now growing up, I had a lot of family members [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=64.88s)]
*  and friends that were affected by severe mental illnesses, especially bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=71.56s)]
*  disease. And so I always wanted to figure out better ways to treat these disorders. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=78.52s)]
*  And so I got into neuroscience, I wanted to understand the brain. And then when I [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=84.84s)]
*  was finishing up my MD and my PhD at Columbia, I was realizing that there are not a lot of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=89.8s)]
*  good treatments for these disorders. The ones that do exist have a lot to be desired, side effects, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=96.28s)]
*  slow onset. And then for disease of neurodegeneration, like Alzheimer's, we just don't have anything that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=103.84s)]
*  truly is able to modify the course of the disease rather than just treat the symptoms. And there's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  also been a lack of new treatments, you know, coming in. They're fairly slow to get new mechanisms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=116.08s)]
*  A lot of the new treatments have just followed a lot of the rehashing of the same mechanisms as [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=121.68s)]
*  before. So when I was finishing up, I said, all right, instead of going into medicine, I'm going to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  found a biotech company to really help address this. And I founded Teren Biosciences and decided [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=131.60000000000002s)]
*  to do things a little bit differently. So I was inspired at the time by looking at a lot of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  tech startups in Silicon Valley and saying, wow, they move so quickly. They're able to do so much [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  in such a short period of time. While a lot of the biotechs I was looking at were moving very slowly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=146.4s)]
*  So I said, we're going to found Teren with a unique company structure that's more flat, where [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  instead of having this hierarchical approach to drug development, we would have a more flat [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=158.08s)]
*  organization where we have a small team. It's very lean of highly trained operators. They're very good [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  at keeping everything organized. And then we hire on the world experts into specific sub teams to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=169.12s)]
*  solve these problems that are previously thought to be impossible. And we've had a lot of success [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=176.72s)]
*  since then. Since the company was founded, we've brought on late stage assets, partnered in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  exclusive licensing agreement assets with Sanofi, where they transferred to us 15,000 patients [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=186.48s)]
*  and over 100 clinical trials. We partnered a late stage asset that had previously been in phase three [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=192.32s)]
*  with another French company called Pierre Fabre, where we exclusively licensed this drug Idaxoxan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=198.88s)]
*  And that's right now in a clinical study that's ongoing. And we think that could really [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=204.0s)]
*  revolutionize schizophrenia treatment. And then we also brought on AI enabled programs. And we [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=207.6s)]
*  brought on software as a medical device that actually just got FDA clearance. And then finally, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=214.72s)]
*  we also entered psychedelics where Teren is one of the largest manufacturers of what's called GMP. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=219.76s)]
*  It's a grade of chemical for human use psychedelics in the world. And we've created more new [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=225.84s)]
*  psychedelic structures than any group that we're aware of right now. And these are tailored [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=232.72s)]
*  compounds to treat specific diseases, new versions of psilocybin, DMT, LSD, MDMA, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=238.08s)]
*  all sorts of improvements that we've been advancing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=245.36s)]
*  Maybe we could talk initially about the psychedelics. What are the challenges of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=249.44s)]
*  using psychedelics? So there are a number of challenges. And the first is they're very highly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  regulated compounds. So you have to make sure you're working with groups that have all the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=261.36s)]
*  right licenses and you're following all the government regulation. So we do that. And we're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=266.0s)]
*  actually doing a lot of work right now in Europe. We have big manufacturing ongoing in Europe. We're [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=270.88s)]
*  supplying clinical studies in Europe right now with our compounds. And then we opened up research [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=276.24s)]
*  labs where we were doing research in the UK where they also have good regulations supporting the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=283.52s)]
*  research around psychedelics. So in the UK, we were creating a large number of new psychedelics, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=288.4s)]
*  where we would say we want to improve certain aspects. I'll give you a few examples. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=295.04s)]
*  There are psychedelics that have long histories of human use. One of them is DMT and 5-methoxydium T. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  But these compounds aren't orally active. I mean, you can't take them in a pill without combining [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=308.16s)]
*  them with other compounds because they break down. But when you combine them with other things called [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  a MAO inhibitor, it can lead to nausea, vomiting, and side effects. So we took a unique approach [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=318.4s)]
*  called a prodrug approach, where you add a little extra side chain to the molecule that allows it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  to be absorbed through the stomach. But then the side chain falls off, allowing just the normal [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  molecule in the bloodstream to act on the brain without modification. That worked. We created the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  world's first orally active DMT. It's absorbed through the GI tract, 5-methoxydium T. We then took [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=342.8s)]
*  that same approach to create the world's first long-acting MDMA. As MDMA right now in clinical [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=349.6s)]
*  studies has shown, you have to, in many cases, dose it twice because it wears off so quickly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  So we create a longer acting form, new forms of LSD, improved forms of compounds like 2CB and other [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  things that are more designed for more tailored treatment. And then other empathogens, similar to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=366.8s)]
*  MDMA. We've improved compounds like methadone and MBDB. These are weaker empathogens, but have a lot [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=372.72s)]
*  of potential for treating PTSD. Is there still somewhat of a stigma attached to psychedelics [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=380.88s)]
*  because of association with LSD, or is that long since past? You know, I think it's largely past [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=387.2s)]
*  now that we have so many companies doing research. The literature has been very clear about the clear [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=394.48s)]
*  benefit of psychedelics to treat different mental illnesses. And so the thing is that we actually [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  haven't dealt with any stigma in that sense. I think people recognize that under the care of a doctor, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, with a prescription, these medicines can be life-changing. And people have also seen the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=412.16s)]
*  impact of severe mental illness and how desperately we need new treatments for mental illness. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=418.16s)]
*  So I would say we have not seen at least any degree of stigma related to our work. And I think just [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=423.76s)]
*  societally, I think people are ready for FDA and EMA cleared psychedelic based medications. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=430.8s)]
*  They have to be administered safely anyway. It's not as if somebody's going to take LSD and have all [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  kinds of weird side effects. It's very strictly regulated. How do they work the psychedelics on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=444.32s)]
*  the brain? Right. And firstly, you brought up a great point that these are what we're discussing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=451.44s)]
*  as psychedelics in a doctor's office regulated by a doctor. But there's a few benefits there. So I'll [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=456.0s)]
*  talk about how they work. And that is that psychedelics hit a lot of receptors in the brain. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=462.16s)]
*  And there's been some LSD hits more than 20 targets. Now, there's been a number of papers [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=467.84s)]
*  that have come out trying to explain exactly what are the receptors that are responsible for that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=473.44s)]
*  efficacy. And there's been a lot of debate. Some may say, well, it's a BDNF brain growth [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=479.52s)]
*  factor receptor. And then another group says, well, it's actually a combination of serotonin [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=484.96s)]
*  one receptor and a bunch of different, and maybe some serotonin C receptor. And there's all this [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=489.68s)]
*  debate. But the idea is that scientists discovered though that despite all those targets, there's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=496.0s)]
*  actually only one receptor in the brain that's responsible for the hallucinations, the trip [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=502.56s)]
*  caused by psychedelics. So whereas the actual receptors involved in efficacy is still hotly [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=508.8s)]
*  debated in the literature, the trip is caused just through the serotonin two A receptor. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=514.72s)]
*  And that discovery led to another big breakthrough that we're actually working on. And that is that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=521.92s)]
*  these scientists around the world at different labs said, we know the psychedelics hit a lot [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=527.44s)]
*  of receptors, we know the two A is the only one required for the trip. What if we were to take a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=532.08s)]
*  psychedelic, combine it with a selective serotonin two A blocker, a second compound that was so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=537.36s)]
*  selective, it only blocked the receptor responsible for the trip. Could we then allow the psychedelic [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=546.16s)]
*  to hit all those other receptors, maintain its efficacy, but have no hallucinations? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=552.08s)]
*  If that were the case, this could be a potential take home medication for depression, something that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=557.84s)]
*  would allow the power of psychedelics to reach much more people. And where you can use original [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=564.0s)]
*  effective psychedelics like psilocybin or DMT compounds that have been so silent, thousands of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=569.6s)]
*  years of human use already. So those scientists did that. And they did a number of animal studies, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=574.96s)]
*  the labs all over the world. And they found that those psychedelics when combined with a serotonin [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=580.32s)]
*  receptor blocker, were just as effective in the animal models as a psychedelic alone. Now, we then [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=585.76s)]
*  at Terran Biosciences, we recognize this breakthrough, and we went and licensed on all [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=593.76s)]
*  those patents and technology from the different academic groups to develop this. But we said, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=598.16s)]
*  you know, we need to move this into humans. Because as you know, scientists have already [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=603.2s)]
*  cured all diseases known to mouse kind. But we don't know if it translates to humans. So we got [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=607.36s)]
*  the first human data with a data analysis study of a trial done in Europe, where they did functional [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=613.52s)]
*  imaging while taking the psychedelic alone and the psychedelic with the blocker in humans. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=620.32s)]
*  And what they found is the psychedelic alone causes rewiring of the networks in the brain, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  as has been shown in many studies before. And that's thought to underlie some of that efficacy. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  But the shocking thing we found was that the psychedelic with the blocker still maintains [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=636.0s)]
*  the same rewiring of the brain in the absence of any trip. So now we're developing this into a [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=641.84s)]
*  medication where we believe this could potentially be a take home medication where you can get the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  benefits of psychedelics to treat diseases like depression with a pill you can take at home, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=654.32s)]
*  where there is no trip, where people who can't afford to go in and get the trip or the time [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=660.0s)]
*  commitment or they could have a bad trip, they can just take this instead and still get that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  benefit. So that's one of the main things we're pushing forward. And the exciting thing is those [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=671.2s)]
*  blockers were the ones we licensed from Sanofi. Sanofi had the world's best serotonin receptor [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=677.28s)]
*  blockers. They licensed that to us. We have our robust psychedelic program. We put the two [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=684.48s)]
*  together and that's what we're developing as a psychedelic without the trip. We worked on [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=690.24s)]
*  things like dose or the frequency that people would have to take that. We are working on that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=695.28s)]
*  right now. Those are questions we're pursuing excitedly. Obviously there are lots of different [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=701.28s)]
*  approaches to tackling things like mental illness or depression or schizophrenia. What's [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=706.72s)]
*  so attractive about the use of psychedelics as opposed to some of the other approaches? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=713.2s)]
*  Psychedelics represent a new mechanism to treat. The best way to understand it is to just look at [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=718.24s)]
*  what's been developed already. Originally you had mono-amine oxidase inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=723.36s)]
*  those generally raise neurotransmitter levels around the brain, but they have a lot of side effects. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=728.96s)]
*  Then you've got selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which globally raise serotonin, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  but they can take months to work and they have a lot of side effects. They have sexual dysfunction, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=740.2399999999999s)]
*  weight gain, all sorts of potential issues, withdraw syndrome. Then you've got more selective [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  ones that hit certain receptors, but again, slower time to onset side effects, well butyran, a [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  compound that works on the dopaminergic system and can cause seizures, takes time to work. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=757.92s)]
*  Psychedelics, shockingly, seem to be able to have longer lasting efficacy that is rapid acting. So [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  it's a rapidly acting efficacy that seems to last longer per dose. They're not necessarily a cure, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=770.88s)]
*  where you just take it and you're good for the rest of your life, but they do represent a class [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=777.28s)]
*  where the mechanism seems to have serious benefits in both safety and time to onset and efficacy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=782.72s)]
*  That's why people are so excited. Now they do come with a trip, which can present an obstacle for [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=791.36s)]
*  some people, but as we covered earlier, there are ways to remove that trip that we are pursuing. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=796.88s)]
*  Then there are conditions where the trip may be useful. Conditions that are based on life trauma, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  such as post-traumatic stress disorder, that really require therapy. In that sense, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=808.24s)]
*  the psychedelic assisted psychotherapy with aspects of the psychedelic experience [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=812.8s)]
*  can be very beneficial. So you actually get another layer of benefit from the trip itself. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=818.16s)]
*  You mentioned some of the drugs in the pipeline, Adizox NXR. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=824.72s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about that one. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=828.88s)]
*  Yes. So that's one of our most exciting assets. So the story behind that asset was this was a [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=830.96s)]
*  drug developed by Pierre Fabre in France. And this was a drug that they had all the way in these big [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  phase three trials for Parkinson's disease, almost 30 years ago in the 1990s. Now it wasn't very [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=843.12s)]
*  effective in Parkinson's for tremor, but at the same time, they had a collaboration going on with [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=849.6s)]
*  the National Institute of Mental Health in the United States, where in the United States, they [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=855.6s)]
*  said, look, this is a very effective drug for schizophrenia with a new mechanism. It's a selective [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=860.64s)]
*  alpha two antagonist. And by adding it to existing antipsychotic regimens, we're able to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=867.44s)]
*  boost the efficacy and in many cases, double the efficacy of the baseline treatment. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=874.6400000000001s)]
*  And what that means is that this could be what's called an adjunctive treatment, something you add [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=880.4000000000001s)]
*  on top of existing therapy for another enormous benefit. And the exciting thing was that at the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=884.8800000000001s)]
*  time, years later, we had a drug called Abilify developed, which was an adjunctive for depression, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=892.48s)]
*  adding on top of your standard antidepressants, it would help provide additional benefit. But there's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=898.48s)]
*  been nothing like that for schizophrenia. There are currently no FDA approved drugs [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=903.6s)]
*  for the adjunctive treatment where you add it on top of your existing regimen. So at the time, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=908.4s)]
*  Pierre Fabre actually discontinued the drug because of one problem. And that was the drug [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=914.88s)]
*  was too short acting. You had to take it up to three times to even some case four times a day. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=919.92s)]
*  It has such a short half life. So that combined with leaving neuroscience as a whole, many big [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  farmers pulled out of neuro and the drug was shelved. Despite the efficacy, there were these [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=932.16s)]
*  pharmacokinetic challenges that stopped the development, which was sad because at the time, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=936.88s)]
*  one of the doctors running the trial said patients and their families were calling begging to be put [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=942.4s)]
*  back on the drug. It was that effective, but there was nothing they could do. The whole program had [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=946.64s)]
*  been discontinued. So we brought back this drug. We went to France. We exclusively licensed the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=952.0s)]
*  drug from Pierre Fabre, got all of the full manufacturing data in, and then we spent several [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=958.48s)]
*  years actually building a once daily version. We built the world's first extended release version [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=964.0s)]
*  of idaxoxan. And we also made a number of other improvements to the molecule along the way. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=971.52s)]
*  And then we went to the FDA. We got the green light to put that into this phase one trial to show [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=976.72s)]
*  that pharmacokinetically, we could hit the right pharmacokinetic range that we would, you could [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=984.48s)]
*  achieve to treat schizophrenia. And the drug has performed great in that trial. And then the goal [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=991.04s)]
*  is then to take it into a schizophrenia trial next as an adjunctive treatment. And we think this [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=997.92s)]
*  could really revolutionize the treatment and give new options for patients because there are [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1003.36s)]
*  currently no drugs on the market anywhere with this mechanism. You mentioned changing it from [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1007.52s)]
*  its initial form so that its efficacy and frequency is better. You almost make it sound [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  like it's a very easy thing to do, but clearly it isn't an easy thing to do. How do you go about [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1020.16s)]
*  making those changes? Those can be very difficult. And initially, we tried to do it and we had reports [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1025.6s)]
*  saying it wasn't possible. But what we did is remember I said that Tarrant has that unique [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1032.0s)]
*  structure where we find the world's experts to solve problems that were typically thought to be [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  impossible. So we searched everywhere until we found someone who had many FDA cleared extended [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1041.36s)]
*  release once daily products. And that person was actually about to retire. But they said, all right, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1049.04s)]
*  we'll take this on as one of our last projects. And they were able to work with the manufacturing [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1054.64s)]
*  team and figure out a way to overcome all the challenges of that molecule in order to make it [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1060.24s)]
*  into a viable once daily release product. And it's by building these teams of people who are highly [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1067.0400000000002s)]
*  skilled around just one specific problem, we're able to get these solutions that have derailed [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1072.88s)]
*  entire big pharma programs previously. That's quite a different model in terms of a company, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1079.12s)]
*  because quite often people, as you said at the beginning, you have a very lean team. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1085.84s)]
*  What made you choose that path that is quite different, but clearly quite effective? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1090.32s)]
*  So there was a couple things, two factors. When I was finishing up my PhD, I was looking at different [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  biotech companies that were operating and they had clinical trial readouts coming out. And I saw [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1103.28s)]
*  how companies that seem to be organized well would have mistakes in the way they would either run the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1109.2s)]
*  clinical trial or the indication or the endpoint or a problem with the manufacturing that would [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1115.92s)]
*  get propagated down the chain and they wouldn't get fixed. And they would end up in a clinical [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1121.52s)]
*  trial, maybe where they've chosen the wrong endpoint, but they can't fix it at that point. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1126.32s)]
*  And they would just go forward and the trial would fail. And the company would collapse or [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1130.32s)]
*  the stock would go down. At the same time, I was watching the rise of some of these big [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  Silicon Valley unicorns like Uber, Snapchat, Instagram, and this was over a long period of [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1140.96s)]
*  time, and just seeing how fast companies would move and pivot and how lean they were and how nimble. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1149.28s)]
*  And I said, why is there nothing like this in biotech? And I was looking at the company [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1154.72s)]
*  structure while in biotech. You've got the CEO and the CEO may only be tangentially involved in [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1159.12s)]
*  the drug development. And then you've got the CMO and then you've got all the directors under [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1163.84s)]
*  the CMO and you've got executive directors and directors and managers and there's so many layers [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1168.32s)]
*  of management and the scientists and there's all these buffers. In Terran, we don't have that. I'm [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1173.52s)]
*  the CEO, but I'm directly in contact and directly involved in the inventions we create, in the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1178.56s)]
*  manufacturing. For the Idesoxan XR, I attended every single manufacturing meeting over a multi-year [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1185.2s)]
*  period to really understand what was going on, that we were on track, that nothing was [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1193.2s)]
*  getting delayed. And that flat organization structure enables us to see immediately when [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1198.24s)]
*  something isn't going right and to pivot quickly to fix it. It's a unique structure and it works [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1204.48s)]
*  for us. We've been able to make it work incredibly well, but it may not work for everyone. It may [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1210.48s)]
*  not be the right model for, for example, a big pharma with 50 products on the market and needs [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1215.84s)]
*  many layers of management to commercialize those products. But at the same time, we don't see big [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1222.4s)]
*  pharma producing the innovation that they used to. It used to be that the innovations would come out [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1227.28s)]
*  of labs in big pharma. Big pharma labs don't produce much innovation anymore. They come from [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1233.04s)]
*  small companies and then they use the merger acquisition model to snap up the inventions, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1238.4s)]
*  buy them in and then commercialize them. We're past the days where Merck was just pumping out [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  the first statins in the world and everything, just immediately putting them on the market. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1248.24s)]
*  They would come out of the Merck research lab. Now it comes out of small biotech labs, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1252.96s)]
*  largely funded by a venture with one asset. And if the asset is successful, a big pharma will buy [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  them. That's not to say that big pharma doesn't do any innovation. They definitely do, but it's a [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1261.6000000000001s)]
*  different model. We've moved more into the small companies get bought out by bigger company. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1265.76s)]
*  It's a merger acquisition model. Now I think for small companies, this works very well. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1270.24s)]
*  It potentially could work for much larger companies, but it's on a case by case basis. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  Could you also go through maybe Eplevencerin and Volenanserin? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1279.68s)]
*  Those are selective serotonin 2A receptor blockers that we are using to remove the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1285.28s)]
*  hallucinations from psychedelics and which may result in a take home medication without the trip. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1291.76s)]
*  A second thing we're using them for is that as a standalone compound, you could end psychedelic [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1297.68s)]
*  trips or tailor them to any duration, which means let's say you want to go in and your doctor wants [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1304.24s)]
*  to give you psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, but they say, look, LSD can last 12 hours. That's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1309.2s)]
*  too many hours. So why don't you come in for three hours of therapy and then you take a receptor [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1314.8s)]
*  blocker and you'll end the therapy then and will tailor your trip duration only three hours. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1320.0s)]
*  And that way you can make it more manageable. Come in for multiple three hour sessions instead of [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1324.8000000000002s)]
*  an all day experience where you get hungry, get tired, and it's just too long. In that case, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1330.16s)]
*  these receptor blockers enable Terin to tailor the duration. And what if someone has a bad trip? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1336.24s)]
*  You just take the blocker and you can end the trip right away. And so that's something that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1342.0800000000002s)]
*  we think will be needed by all psychedelic treatment centers in the future. Everyone is [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1345.92s)]
*  going to need a way to tailor the duration of their trips and to end bad trips. And with these [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1351.44s)]
*  compounds, we hope to provide that solution. And when you're talking about repurposing of different [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1357.44s)]
*  drugs that have been used in the past for other things, I guess the message is that you don't [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1363.68s)]
*  necessarily always need to reinvent the wheel. Yeah. I mean, the thing is that there are compounds [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1367.92s)]
*  that have been highly effective in the past, safe and selective that just, you know, given our [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1373.52s)]
*  knowledge of the brain 20 years ago, they just didn't know what to use it for and they were [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1379.28s)]
*  shelved. And so one of the advantages of Terin and our unique structure is being able to [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1383.76s)]
*  bring back those medications, improve on them and put them where they really can provide benefit. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1388.96s)]
*  Because for example, you know, Eplevanser and Volananser are selective serotonin 2A receptor [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1394.32s)]
*  blockers. 20 years ago, there wasn't much of a need to selectively block the serotonin 2A [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1399.84s)]
*  receptor. You know, in the early 2000s, you said, well, we can block that receptor. People say, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1405.36s)]
*  well, what's that good for? You know, maybe it's a good antipsychotic, but it didn't really pan out. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1410.08s)]
*  And in this case, we found that, well, psychedelics activate that receptor. There's a huge unmet need [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1415.52s)]
*  to block that receptor now. And so that now is really the best time for those. So compounds can [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1422.08s)]
*  be discovered before people realize they're useful. I'll give you an example. MDMA, that [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1427.44s)]
*  compound is currently undergoing review by the FDA and it may be cleared later this year. MDMA is [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1433.6000000000001s)]
*  highly effective to treat post-traumatic stress disorder with therapy. And you know, in the 80s [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1440.8s)]
*  is when it really was, late 70s or 80s was when it really started to be tested for that. And then it [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1445.92s)]
*  was made illegal and now it's been brought back. But if you wouldn't really guess that MDMA was [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1452.16s)]
*  first synthesized in 1912, you know, that's the drug that people started taking at raves in the 80s. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1457.52s)]
*  But it's been around since 1912, just nobody realized what it did back then. You know, that [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1465.68s)]
*  drug was invented way back, you know, and nobody really knew that at the time we had MDMA, but, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1470.88s)]
*  you know, nobody imagined that could have been used for post-traumatic stress disorder throughout [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1477.44s)]
*  the last century, but nobody knew about it. And so that's the idea is that compounds can be developed [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1482.08s)]
*  long before we realize what they're useful for. As we develop more and more drugs and as we have [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1486.8s)]
*  more companies and more capacity to do things, sometimes standalone drugs that didn't work in [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1493.76s)]
*  one particular way might work in combination with other therapies and other drugs. That's right. And [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1500.56s)]
*  that's what we're doing with the Eplavanserin and Volananserin. And similarly, another item [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1507.04s)]
*  we're really working on is to make sure, though, that the standalone drugs, that the price remains [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1512.8s)]
*  accessible and affordable for patients, and that we don't end up in a situation where one company [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1519.2s)]
*  is controlling, you know, the whole, you know, monopoly on any drug from DMT, psilocybin, MDMA, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1525.2s)]
*  or any compound. And in the United States, we have a great program where that, you know, get your own [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1531.12s)]
*  drugs on the market to keep the prices down called the 505b2 path. That's a path that generic drug [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1537.76s)]
*  manufacturers take. It means five years after a molecule that's off patent gets approved, you're [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1544.32s)]
*  able to use that data package to put a similar molecule on the market without having to go back [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  and do the expensive phase three trials. And Taryn has now ramped up and is ready to do that for [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1557.6s)]
*  psilocybin, MDMA, and we hope to do with DMT and 5-methoxy DMT as well. So we have very robust 505b2 [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1562.48s)]
*  programs to put classic psychedelics on the market five years after any other company puts them on [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1570.7199999999998s)]
*  the market to guarantee affordable access for patients. So I guess we're not talking about some [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1578.1599999999999s)]
*  of the therapies that can cost millions of dollars per dose. Well, the shocking thing is that because [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1584.4s)]
*  of the time it takes to have these psychedelic trips, we had heard, you know, prices thrown [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1590.5600000000002s)]
*  around in the past that were outrageous, that doctors could be charging enormous sums of money [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1595.8400000000001s)]
*  for patients to come in and get, you know, a six hour trip experience. It could be in the tens of [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1601.2s)]
*  thousands, people were saying. And we said, this is outrageous. Taryn Biosciences will find a way [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1606.88s)]
*  to make sure that patients have accessible, affordable medications. And the only way to do that [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1612.24s)]
*  is to get 505b2 medicines on the market five years after any clearance. Now, we've taken a unique [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1619.28s)]
*  approach here to guarantee that we're able to do that. And that is that there is one loophole in [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1626.4s)]
*  that program that some companies use to block generic entry. And that is this Orange Book exemption. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1632.32s)]
*  What that means is that five years is up for a molecule or the composition of molecules off [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1641.3600000000001s)]
*  patent. But if there's some patent on some aspect of administrators, something related to that [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1646.16s)]
*  compound, and they have a patent registered in the Orange Book, they can file a lawsuit against [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1652.0s)]
*  generics coming on to try to slow them down for, you know, 30 months, it's a huge amount of time. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1657.84s)]
*  So what we've done at Taryn is we've created new salts and polymorphs of the molecules. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1664.72s)]
*  What that means is we take the same molecule, for example, MDMA is getting approved right now as the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1670.8s)]
*  hydrochloride salt. We create the fumarate and the hemifumarate salt. It turns into the same molecule [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1676.32s)]
*  in the body. It's just as bioavailable as the hydrochloride salt. In our case, we think it's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1682.48s)]
*  actually better. We believe it has serious advantages over the hydrochloride salt. But, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1687.2s)]
*  you know, it's neither here nor there. The idea is that because they both turn in MDMA in the body, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1691.28s)]
*  the FDA, in many cases allows that to just be a 505B2 path, same molecule, different salt. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1695.52s)]
*  But the fact that they're different salts means that any patents on the hydrochloride salt cannot [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1701.84s)]
*  block the hemifumarate salt that Taryn develops. Same thing. Psilocybin getting developed right now [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1707.44s)]
*  is a zwitterion. It's a non-salt form, but it's just psilocybin. Taryn has created the first [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1713.6s)]
*  hydrochloride salt of psilocybin in the world, and that is not affected by the patents covering [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1719.2s)]
*  the zwitterionic form of psilocybin. And so we believe we will not be affected by any [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1724.72s)]
*  Orange Book challenges coming up, and Taryn will succeed to bring cheap, affordable medications to [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1729.92s)]
*  patients the five years after using the data packages from the approved drugs in order to [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1736.0s)]
*  guarantee that patients have access to their medications. When you first started many years [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1741.92s)]
*  ago, did you kind of realize all of the things that you'd have to get into, like patents and [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1748.24s)]
*  things that are different from what you set out to do? You know, I have to admit, there's a lot [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1753.92s)]
*  of surprises along the way. Biotech is more complicated than it looks when you're starting [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1759.36s)]
*  out, but we learned quickly. We have great advisors. We have the best attorneys in the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1765.04s)]
*  world, we believe, to help us navigate the complex regulatory and IP landscape to get those affordable [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1770.88s)]
*  medications to patients. Because look, you know, that was one of the main issues that I was seeing [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1777.44s)]
*  back in college is, you know, friends that where there were new branded medications they couldn't [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1783.8400000000001s)]
*  afford or their health care didn't cover it. And it's just, I don't we don't want to see that happen [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  with psychedelics, where, you know, these are compounds that have been around for thousands of [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1792.0s)]
*  years of human use, you know, costs should not be a barrier to entry. And as such, Taryn has already [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1796.56s)]
*  ramped up the wide, you know, large scale manufacturing of these psychedelics at our plant [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1802.48s)]
*  in Europe, where we're already supplying clinical studies with our psychedelics right now. And we [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1809.04s)]
*  are excited to use that already validated process. We already submitted a drug master file to the FDA [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1815.2s)]
*  for psilocybin. And then we will be using the manufacturing to put those Taryn branded compounds [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1821.6s)]
*  on the market five years after and a 505 B2. Could you tell me a little bit about empathogens [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1827.92s)]
*  and your work with that? Absolutely. So in pathogens, the main one everyone knows about [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1833.52s)]
*  is MDMA. These are compounds that increase people's feeling of empathy. And when paired with therapy [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1839.6000000000001s)]
*  has been shown to be highly effective at post traumatic stress disorder, that is a debilitating, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1847.52s)]
*  terrible disease that can happen when people experience traumatic life event from assaults [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1854.0s)]
*  through war through all sorts of terrible things. And MDMA is the one that Lycos is right now has [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1860.24s)]
*  submitted for FDA clearance. And MDMA is also the one where Taryn has created the world's first new [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1868.16s)]
*  salts. And we're gearing up because we already have big manufacturing ongoing, we're gearing up for [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1874.16s)]
*  our 505 B2. However, there are a number of other empathogens that are weaker, that may have benefit [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1880.1599999999999s)]
*  and may even be able to be taken at home one day. These are compounds that Taryn has looked at for [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1887.28s)]
*  many years. So one is MDEA. It's a analog of MDMA that's a little weaker and we think could be [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1892.56s)]
*  beneficial and have advantages over MDMA. Another is the very weak MBDB that we believe could have [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1899.28s)]
*  advantages for treating anxiety and other conditions that aren't as powerful as something [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1906.8s)]
*  you need for post traumatic stress disorder, but have kind of a more mild effect. And the last one [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1911.44s)]
*  where we've made a lot of improvements is a compound called Methylone that we've been developing for a [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1916.6399999999999s)]
*  number of years. And that's where we actually found that the molecule itself, which exists in [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1921.44s)]
*  the right and left handed forms of the molecule, the side effects were associated with just one [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1927.76s)]
*  form and the benefits were associated with the other form. And so we purify the molecule to remove [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1932.64s)]
*  the mirror image that caused the side effects and then developed a number of new breakthroughs, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1939.2s)]
*  salts, polymorphs, and are developing that as an alternative therapy for treating post traumatic [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1945.76s)]
*  stress disorder in what's called its enantiomerically pure form. That means the pure form of the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1950.72s)]
*  molecule that is missing the other form that causes what we believe to be all the side effects. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1956.16s)]
*  You've got so many things on the go. Where are you at with clinical trials right now? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  So we're actually in a big clinical trial right now in multi site in Australia, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1967.4399999999998s)]
*  where we are finishing up the testing of that new form of itoxoxan and [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1972.2399999999998s)]
*  scheduled to enroll over 150 people to finish that trial. And that's going very well. We are [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1977.04s)]
*  supplying psychedelics to different clinical trials in Europe at different academic sites. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1983.28s)]
*  And then we have some more clinical trials planned coming up. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1988.4s)]
*  Could you tell me about NM 101? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1992.48s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's our software program. So there's a very exciting breakthrough. And that that is that [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=1995.52s)]
*  there is a biomarker for dopamine that was really discovered a while back, but in the last 20 years [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2001.1200000000001s)]
*  has been shown in many research studies to be a great diagnostic and prognostic marker for [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2008.24s)]
*  Parkinson's just to aid in the diagnosis of Parkinson's to help predict who's going to [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2014.72s)]
*  respond to treatment to really just monitor that disease. And it's called neuromelanin. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2018.56s)]
*  And every day, a little bit of our dopamine in our brains breaks down and it binds to iron. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2023.92s)]
*  And it forms this breakdown product called neuromelanin. And it can be detected on a [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2029.2s)]
*  standard MRI without contrast. Now, right now, in the diagnosis of Parkinson's patients undergo, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2033.68s)]
*  in many cases, not all, but many cases, they undergo an imaging test called the DAT scan, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2041.52s)]
*  where they get an IV infusion, a radioactive radio tracer, and it takes a number of hours, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2046.72s)]
*  and it can be painful, and it can expose you to radiation, and it can be very expensive. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2052.32s)]
*  But there have been clinical studies of neuromelanin in the past in the literature that [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2058.0s)]
*  said that neuromelanin is as effective as a DAT scan in just five minutes on an MRI scan. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2063.2799999999997s)]
*  No contrast, no radiation, no IV infusion. And that's just what the literature was saying. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2068.48s)]
*  And there are all these recommendations in the literature for it to be the new standard of care. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2074.72s)]
*  But despite all of those, it was never FDA cleared. And the reason why is there was no way to [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2079.2s)]
*  standardize the measurement and automate it. So Columbia University, University of Ottawa made a [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2084.48s)]
*  number of breakthroughs in algorithms to do that. We licensed them on. Then we reprogrammed those [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  algorithms into a full cloud-based deployable package that could integrate with any hospital [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2096.4s)]
*  worldwide directly through their imaging system, meaning a doctor could just get an MRI, push a [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2102.48s)]
*  button. It sends it straight to Terran. We analyze it and send back a result, de-identified so there's [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2107.36s)]
*  no privacy risk, and they get the neuromelanin measurement. The FDA recently cleared our [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2112.48s)]
*  software as a medical device for the measurement of neuromelanin, where it can provide potentially [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2118.88s)]
*  useful adjunctive information to doctors who want neuromelanin imaging. And this is the first time [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2124.88s)]
*  in history that a software has been FDA cleared for the analysis of neuromelanin MRI. And we've [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2131.04s)]
*  had 20 years of doctors calling for this to be included in the standard of care. And so we're [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2138.0s)]
*  very excited to finally make that available. I guess there are other companies working on [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2141.76s)]
*  psychedelics. How does what you do differ to some of the other companies? Right. So there are other [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2147.84s)]
*  companies developing psychedelics, and I think they can largely fit into two buckets. Bucket one, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2153.68s)]
*  companies developing classic psychedelics. DMT, 5-methoxy DMT, LSD, MDMA, you know, the classic [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  insulin siphon. Just straight up in a pill with the trip. And that has a long history of human use. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2166.8799999999997s)]
*  The trials have shown it to be effective. And what we do is a little different. We're not pushing [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  through the original classic psychedelic alone. We'll use the 505v2 path. And when I say alone, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2177.8399999999997s)]
*  without any combination of other drugs, just the pill itself, because we have already robust [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2183.92s)]
*  manufacturing, new forms of the drug, we're able to do the 505v2 path. It would be a waste of money [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2188.8s)]
*  for us to repeat the same clinical trials that are ongoing right now with classic psychedelics, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2194.88s)]
*  because they're already showing to be effective, and they're going to get the drugs approved. And [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2200.16s)]
*  then Terran will be there to put essentially generic form of the drug on the market five years [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2204.16s)]
*  after approval without any orange book block. Then the second bucket is companies trying to [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2208.56s)]
*  remove the trip from psychedelics. Those companies do this through deriving the molecule, making [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2215.2s)]
*  derivatives, but then they end up with versions of the molecule that have never been tested in [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2221.04s)]
*  humans and aren't necessarily safe or effective. And as we know, the majority of compound derivatives [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2225.44s)]
*  are actually are eliminated at phase one due to safety or efficacy, or safety or problems, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2231.52s)]
*  the pharmacogenic issues, and then by phase two, a lack of efficacy. So what Terran does is we take [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2237.28s)]
*  the classic psychedelic, combine it with the receptor blocker, remove the trip as a combo pill, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2242.32s)]
*  and then you get the benefit of the original psychedelic, at least that's the goal, to get [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2248.5600000000004s)]
*  the benefit and safety of the original psychedelic. And no other company in the world is doing that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2252.0s)]
*  And then we don't know of anyone else in the world that's developing a compound to end psychedelic [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2256.8s)]
*  trips. And that's our blocker alone, because we have the worldwide exclusive rights to these [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2261.84s)]
*  blockers from Sanofi. Do you think that some of these conditions ultimately are curable? Or are [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2266.24s)]
*  you really just looking at management? I think what we're looking at is much better treatment. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2272.4799999999996s)]
*  We haven't seen cases where psychedelics necessarily, well, it depends on the disease, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2278.72s)]
*  I think. Post-traumatic stress disorder, because it's tied to a specific life event, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2284.24s)]
*  is potentially curable in some cases, if you can get the therapy and be treated. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2289.4399999999996s)]
*  But certain cases of depression, or schizophrenia, or bipolar, those are based on changes in the brain [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2296.24s)]
*  that may be with you for the rest of your life. But with treatments that are long lasting and [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  potentially can reverse some of that, we're moving towards much better treatments. We haven't seen [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2307.3599999999997s)]
*  anything yet that's a full cure, meaning a, you know, one-in-you're-totally-done kind of treatment. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2312.4799999999996s)]
*  But the goal is that we get treatments that are so good that patients living with these conditions [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2318.4799999999996s)]
*  can have a great quality of life. And look, there may be something in the future that's developed [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2325.2s)]
*  that will be that cure. We haven't seen it yet, but with gene therapies down the line and all sorts [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2329.7599999999998s)]
*  of things, there may be that, you know, eventually medicine will get so good that we hope we can just [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2335.52s)]
*  cure everything with one treatment. But our goal is now to treat more effectively with less side effects [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2340.24s)]
*  and move towards those cures as best we can. Right now, treatments are able to stop hallucinations, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2346.64s)]
*  but they're not able to stop what's called the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2352.24s)]
*  social withdrawal and depression and memory loss and cognitive decline. And originally, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2357.04s)]
*  when schizophrenia was first discovered, it was classified along with dementias due to the degree [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2363.8399999999997s)]
*  of cognitive decline. And unfortunately, while current medications can treat hallucinations, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2368.64s)]
*  it's hard to treat those other symptoms. And that's what we're also working towards. And we [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2374.64s)]
*  hope it is oxygen will do that because I did oxygen did show significant benefit on negative [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2378.24s)]
*  and cognitive symptoms in its last clinical studies. And so we're really hoping this could [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2384.4799999999996s)]
*  really revolutionize the treatment and improve the quality of life for patients living with these [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2389.6s)]
*  conditions. And it's a global issue, and it's a big issue. So it's a surprisingly common issue. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2393.68s)]
*  It may surprise you to know that schizophrenia occurs at a higher rate than type one diabetes [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2401.68s)]
*  and Alzheimer's disease. And the thing is that studies have shown between 0.7 to 1% [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2407.28s)]
*  the entire world's population, almost one out of 100 people has schizophrenia. But it's so [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2413.84s)]
*  debilitating that those people often end up on the street or out of sight, we don't see them as much [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2419.2000000000003s)]
*  as and so things diseases like oh, type one diabetes or Alzheimer's, we it's more in our [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2425.1200000000003s)]
*  site. So we think they're much more common. But in reality, schizophrenia is a surprisingly [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2430.6400000000003s)]
*  prevalent and common disorder that really needs more treatment. It's just completely debilitating [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2436.32s)]
*  in many cases, but we are working towards improving the treatments for those patients [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2442.32s)]
*  that don't have good options right now. Another enjoyable and also very informative conversation. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfglv8v_rE&t=2446.96s)]
