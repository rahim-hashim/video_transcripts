# Beyond Biotech podcast 69 – improving access to cell and gene therapy
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech Podcast number 69. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly The Biotech Podcast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=13.24s)]
*  It's the end of October, so Halloween and Bio Europe in Munich is just around the corner. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=17.56s)]
*  This week on the podcast we're talking about how to make cell and gene therapy more affordable [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  and more accessible. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=29.96s)]
*  Ori Biotech is helping the industry understand who and just how many people are actually [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=31.76s)]
*  receiving the approved cell and gene therapies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=37.660000000000004s)]
*  Although more than 20,000 patients have now received a commercial cell therapy since 2017, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=41.36s)]
*  growth is not going to meet demand for years, by which point there will be a lot more approved [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=47.72s)]
*  cell therapies competing for limited manufacturing capacity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  Jason Foster, Ori's CEO, can tell us more. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=57.56s)]
*  First, if you can just give us a bit of background on the company. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=62.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=66.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=67.76s)]
*  So Ori, I was lucky enough to join the company or meet the company founders in 2018 after [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=68.76s)]
*  I left the business that I had been with for 10 years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=75.16s)]
*  Ori was founded to try and solve the scalability challenge in cell therapy manufacturing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=79.12s)]
*  So the founders of the business, Farland and Chris, they met as professors at UCL, University [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=84.88s)]
*  College London, which has a very long history, as you might know, in regenerative medicine, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=91.96s)]
*  biochemical engineering, et cetera. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=96.96s)]
*  And they were very close to Bruce Levine's lab at UPenn. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=99.56s)]
*  And you'll know Bruce is one of the creators of Kimriah in the first cell therapy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=102.6s)]
*  Bruce came over to present some of his early stage clinical data for what became Kimriah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=107.32s)]
*  And I think this is now 2015. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=112.64s)]
*  This is kind of one of the seminal moments in the field where 10 out of 10 refractory [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=114.4s)]
*  patients responded. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  This kind of incredible clinical result that the industry had been waiting for forever. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  And people kind of threw their hands in the air and cheered. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=125.84s)]
*  And Chris and Farland looked at each other and said, how are we going to make these things? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  And they sort of went off drawing on the back of a napkin these giant facilities, 100,000 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=133.44s)]
*  square feet, and could only really get 1,000 doses a year out of them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=137.6s)]
*  And I'm like, that doesn't really make any sense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=141.08s)]
*  That can't be right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=142.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, even what's now almost 10 years ago, they were more right than they knew at [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=143.56s)]
*  that point. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=147.48s)]
*  But it went off to try and understand really how to make these things and make them accessible [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=148.48s)]
*  for patients. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=153.64s)]
*  ORI's mission as a company is to enable widespread patient access to lifesaving cell and gene [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=154.64s)]
*  therapies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=160.16s)]
*  The cold reality today is that we have cures for cancer and rare diseases that patients [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=161.16s)]
*  can't get access to because they're too expensive, they're too hard to make. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=165.64s)]
*  They just can't supply the need out there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=169.64s)]
*  And that is really an untenable outcome from my perspective. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=173.6s)]
*  I know almost everyone that I talk to has had been touched by cancer in some way, themselves [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  or a family member or a friend. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=181.72s)]
*  We all know 10 million people a year diagnosed with cancer, another 10 million people a year [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  die of cancer. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=188.64s)]
*  And having cures for some of these patients that just can't be accessed is just not okay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=190.92s)]
*  So that's really the kind of foundations of the company founded to try and solve this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=195.76s)]
*  access problem, solve this manufacturing problem for what is a new modality. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=200.16s)]
*  As you know, cell therapy or autologous cell therapy in particular, it's a whole new supply [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  chain, it's a whole new modality, it's a whole new way of thinking for biopharma. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=211.48s)]
*  It's totally different than making tablets or biologics. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  We have this circular supply chain where we have to get starting material for the patient [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=219.48s)]
*  and return that therapeutic back to that individual patient. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=223.4s)]
*  If we make it of my cells, it's not going to work for you and vice versa. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  And this is something that the industry just really hasn't had to grapple with before. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  And we haven't really got our head around it completely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=232.84s)]
*  And today's reality is we just throw bigger buildings and more people at the problem and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=235.6s)]
*  try and fix it that way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=240.48s)]
*  But it doesn't change the fundamental problem, which is we don't have the tools we need, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=242.68s)]
*  the current strategies aren't effective at really making these products in large quantities [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=246.6s)]
*  at an accessible price. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=253.4s)]
*  And so that's really the genesis of Ori is really solving that market access challenge [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=256.2s)]
*  and to build a platform that's bespoke for the needs of this particular industry rather [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=260.16s)]
*  than being repurposed and trying to jam the square peg into the round hole, which we've [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=265.0s)]
*  done for years and hasn't really worked that well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=269.24s)]
*  In terms of the issues surrounding cell and gene therapies, is it something where maybe, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=271.92s)]
*  I don't say to abandon it, but are other options being looked into to try and either get around [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=280.12s)]
*  that or to change the mechanism rather than to try and keep it the way it is but make [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=288.44s)]
*  it cheaper? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=294.64s)]
*  I would say choice D, all the above is probably the answer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  They're looking at every potential opportunity. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=301.44s)]
*  So I think in cell and gene, sometimes we think we're special. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=304.56s)]
*  In cell and gene, it's okay that we cost a lot because these are hard to make products, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=308.96s)]
*  but we're also looking at interventions that come from other areas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=314.44s)]
*  ADC is a big area of research and work right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=318.56s)]
*  Of course, immunotherapies have had a lot of clinical benefit for patients. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=322.0s)]
*  So we need to be cost effective in the round to treat the patient. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=327.88s)]
*  Not the cell and gene intervention can be 10x what the other interventions are. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=332.96s)]
*  It doesn't really work that way. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=337.12s)]
*  So I think you're right that we need to reframe our thought process to say we need to make [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=338.12s)]
*  products that are affordable and accessible, not just approvable by the regulator. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=344.96s)]
*  And that includes products that are more easily manufactured. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=351.32s)]
*  Manufacturing platforms like Ori's intend to try and make these more accessible in that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=355.48s)]
*  way. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=358.96s)]
*  Allogeneic approaches where we only have half the supply chain, we source donor cells, we [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=359.96s)]
*  make a cell therapy product and we make it so that it could be effective for anyone more [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=365.12s)]
*  generically is an approach that people are exploring. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=369.8s)]
*  There's lots of challenges with it, but it's an approach. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=374.04s)]
*  And then there's certainly lots of other approaches to treat similar diseases. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=377.12s)]
*  We have very effective medications like, just to use one example, Carvicti and multiple [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=380.16s)]
*  myeloma, which is a CAR-T product. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=385.24s)]
*  We've never seen efficacy ever in the industry like we see with that product as an example. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=388.68s)]
*  90 plus percent of patients have a complete response. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=394.12s)]
*  I mean, these are just incredible numbers. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=397.4s)]
*  So we know it's clinically effective. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=398.8s)]
*  So we don't need to improve the efficacy or the safety. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=400.56s)]
*  We really need to improve the manufacturability of the access, the kind of distribution of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=403.6s)]
*  the products. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=407.56s)]
*  So trying to solve for all those things at once is a little bit difficult. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=408.56s)]
*  So I think there are other products that will try and provide clinical benefit for multiple [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=411.44s)]
*  myeloma patients as an example. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=416.4s)]
*  But I think ultimately we're very focused on bringing this incredibly clinically effective [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=418.96s)]
*  modality to patients at scale. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=424.12s)]
*  That seems to be the most direct path to have a big impact on patients. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=426.52s)]
*  Is a part of that also trying to get this to be something that's off the shelf? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=431.56s)]
*  It certainly could be. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=436.67999999999995s)]
*  I do a podcast as well, Ori Spotlight, and I had Bruce Levine on the podcast and I asked [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  him this question. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=443.12s)]
*  Often this aloe versus auto debate. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=445.08s)]
*  So like one versus the other. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=447.48s)]
*  Bruce's view and the view of a lot of the thought leaders in this space is that actually [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=450.12s)]
*  we've proven the clinical case for autologous. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=454.52s)]
*  We know that there is a challenge with manufacturing and cost of goods. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=458.68s)]
*  We haven't yet proven the clinical case for allogeneic. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=462.52s)]
*  It's more of a concept. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=465.9s)]
*  We know there's durability and potency and all kinds of challenges there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=467.88s)]
*  And we're not even sure that it's going to be cheaper. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=470.92s)]
*  We sort of assume it will be. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't even know yet for sure. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=475.04s)]
*  His view is that both of these modalities will evolve kind of in parallel. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=477.36s)]
*  And you might see some cell types or some indications where an allogeneic approach works. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=481.76s)]
*  And you might see others where autologous remains the leader. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=485.44s)]
*  I think ultimately treating patients with their own immune cells will always be more [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=489.68s)]
*  straightforward and more clinically effective probably than with donor cells or non-native [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  cells. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=501.12s)]
*  Again, that's not the only consideration. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=502.44s)]
*  It's how affordable are these products? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  How widely accessible are they? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=506.0s)]
*  My position would be that those two modalities will evolve in parallel and we'll see some [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=507.92s)]
*  evolution to where they're targeted at very specific uses and use cases that make the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=513.24s)]
*  most sense for that particular modality. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=517.92s)]
*  Totally makes sense. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=521.76s)]
*  What is it that you're developing to address some of these issues? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=523.28s)]
*  So, ORIES is a manufacturing platform. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=528.12s)]
*  We're an enabling technology company. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=531.48s)]
*  We're not a therapeutics developer. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=533.12s)]
*  So we would partner with those companies that are making, let's say, CAR-T products just [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=534.48s)]
*  as an example. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=538.8s)]
*  And they could develop their products on the platform. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=540.96s)]
*  And then also the kind of real secret sauce, if you will, the special magic we're trying [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  to pull off here is to build a platform that's flexible enough at the early phases so you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=549.36s)]
*  can do research on it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=555.0s)]
*  You can sort of discover what process is going to work to transform that immune cell into [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  a therapeutic. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=560.64s)]
*  Today, we do that in lab tools. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=561.64s)]
*  We have flasks and bags and micro pipettes and all the tools that you'd expect to see [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  in a lab. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  But then you have to fundamentally change the process not once but several times and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=569.56s)]
*  you're on your path to commercialization, which leads to a lot of challenges and costs [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  and delays and often to the product failing to reach the market. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=577.24s)]
*  In the ORIES world, if we build a platform that's flexible enough for them to do research [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=581.76s)]
*  on and they can get it to work on the platform, then we know that it will seamlessly scale [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=585.8s)]
*  with them into the clinic and ultimately to commercial scale manufacturing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=590.56s)]
*  So it takes a lot of that tech transfer process comparability risk off the table. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=593.8s)]
*  We know we can develop it with that platform. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=600.2199999999999s)]
*  We just do more of it in parallel, essentially. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=602.12s)]
*  So it's both flexibility and scalability. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=605.5s)]
*  So ours is a hardware platform. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=608.28s)]
*  It's actually a physical instrument. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=609.8s)]
*  It's consumables that are utilized during the process. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  And then that's underpinned by a cloud native data platform. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=615.72s)]
*  So it allows us to really capture data from in the system, kind of where the cells are [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=619.76s)]
*  growing and understand that process at a fundamental level where we can't really today. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  You'll hear it described sort of as magic or as a black box. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=628.88s)]
*  Like what happens in the manufacturing process is kind of invisible to everyone. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=632.6s)]
*  No one's really sure because biology isn't engineering. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=636.52s)]
*  It's much more nuanced. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  So we're not really sure why the cells do what they do. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=641.78s)]
*  Sometimes we see high failure rates or high variability in these processes because we're [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=644.24s)]
*  putting human cells in them. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=648.24s)]
*  And it's very hard for us to explain. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  If the regulator asks us like, why did that outcome occur? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=651.92s)]
*  Often times we say, well, we're not sure. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=654.64s)]
*  Ultimately that answer is not going to be good enough for long. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  So we're really trying to make a platform that's reliable, repeatable, that can make [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  products at a high throughput. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=665.76s)]
*  So tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of doses a year and also at a dramatically [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=668.0s)]
*  lower cost to make them much more accessible for patients. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=672.52s)]
*  That's really what Ori's trying to do. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=675.76s)]
*  What is it doing exactly in order to improve things? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=677.8s)]
*  Is it just speeding up the process or is it improving the rate at which you can create cells? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=682.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of both those things at the kind of base level. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=690.04s)]
*  We're trying to automate currently manual processes. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=693.6s)]
*  So in today, you'll have a lot of human operators moving around a process where they're [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=697.0s)]
*  moving cells from one unit operation to the next. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=702.12s)]
*  Usually they'll tube weld into a gas permeable bag. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=704.6s)]
*  Then they'll take that bag downstream. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=707.84s)]
*  They'll tube weld it into another piece of equipment. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=709.2s)]
*  That piece of equipment will do its job and they'll tube weld again to get the process, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=711.6s)]
*  the product out of that step. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=715.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of highly manual steps that are constrained by volume, by the limitations [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=717.32s)]
*  of that particular piece of equipment. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=724.32s)]
*  So it's just a highly manual operation. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=725.72s)]
*  I've seen a video of a Novartis operator in their Camaraya process shaking a bag of cells [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=729.16s)]
*  back and forth like this. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=733.52s)]
*  It kind of gives you a sense of the level of manual kind of intervention that's required [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  today. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=739.6s)]
*  So we try and take a lot of those manual steps out. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=740.8s)]
*  Some of that is due to the flexibility of the system. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  So the bioreactor, the cell culture vessel, is flexible in itself. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=746.16s)]
*  So it allows us to do different unit operations, do them at low volume, do them at high volume, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=751.8s)]
*  do a static culture, do an active culture. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=756.32s)]
*  It allows us to add things when we want, take things out when we want. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=759.64s)]
*  So this kind of gives you an indication of the flexibility of the system. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=761.64s)]
*  And the other key component is automating fluid handling. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=764.64s)]
*  A lot of this is a fluid handling problem. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=767.64s)]
*  We're putting cells into a vessel usually, then we're adding media or we're adding cytokines [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=769.64s)]
*  or we're taking a sample or adding virus. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=774.64s)]
*  It's a lot of moving fluids back and forth as part of this process. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=776.64s)]
*  So if you can automate that fluid handling piece, you actually take a lot of those manual [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=780.64s)]
*  interventions out. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=785.64s)]
*  So we're putting a lot of the need for human operators and people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=787.4s)]
*  So we think in the first iteration of the ORI platform, which will launch next year, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=789.4s)]
*  we'll drop the labor requirement by up to 70%. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=793.4s)]
*  And these are very highly skilled, very hard to find operators today. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=797.4s)]
*  So we'll drop the labor requirement by 70%, allowing those people to go do other high-value [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=802.4s)]
*  tasks, not tube welding, which isn't a particularly high-value task. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=807.4s)]
*  But also for the remaining 30%, we can de-skill that labor to a kind of technician level versus [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=811.4s)]
*  PhD immunologist level. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=817.16s)]
*  So it really expands the labor pool to be able to deliver these products for patients [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=818.16s)]
*  at scale. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=823.16s)]
*  And we think by doing that, along with some other savings in the system and the way we [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=824.16s)]
*  use reagents and virus and other components, we'll be able to drop cost of goods by around [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=829.16s)]
*  50%, so 5-0% in the first iteration that will launch next year. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=834.16s)]
*  We would argue that's a great step forward. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=839.16s)]
*  I think a product that costs today $150,000 to make roughly, if you're talking about one [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=840.16s)]
*  of the first-generation CAR-T products, that then costs $75,000 to make, that's a significant [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=845.92s)]
*  step forward. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=849.92s)]
*  However, I think you and I can both realize that a product that costs $75,000 to make [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=850.92s)]
*  is still too expensive to be widely accessible in first line. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=854.92s)]
*  So everything we've developed has been built with kind of first layer automation contained [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=858.92s)]
*  within, but then second layer automation in mind. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=865.92s)]
*  So full automation where actually you take all of the human operators out, or 99% of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=868.92s)]
*  it, and robotics fill the gap. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=873.68s)]
*  So the ability to do that, we think, will drop cost of goods by maybe 80% or 90% totally. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=875.68s)]
*  And then you're talking about products that would be very cost effective, certainly at [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=883.68s)]
*  second line, if you're comparing it to a bone marrow transplant or a stem cell transplant. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=886.68s)]
*  But maybe even at first line, when you go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy, hospital [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=891.68s)]
*  stays, testing, all the things that are entailed with cancer treatment, just to use that as [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=895.68s)]
*  an example, we can see that curative, let's just say CAR T therapy could be cost effective [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  at first line. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=906.4399999999999s)]
*  Firstly, definitely clinically, I think clinically effective, it makes a lot of sense, right? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  We're using a healthier patient cells to make the therapeutic, it's likely that you're going [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  to get as good or better clinical effect. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  But there's really this cost effectiveness issue, and there's a massive amount of cost [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  associated with hospitalization. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=921.68s)]
*  Right now you're seeing more and more clinical trials actually doing outpatient treatment, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=923.9799999999999s)]
*  particularly in the US for CAR T and for others. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=930.28s)]
*  So we're sort of, we're learning our way, we're finding our way through about how to [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=933.28s)]
*  have less intervention, less side effects, healthier patients that are drawing less out [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=936.36s)]
*  of the healthcare system. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=942.08s)]
*  So I think the combination of those efforts, hopefully will bring these products to first [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=943.08s)]
*  line. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=947.12s)]
*  That would be our hope. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=948.12s)]
*  You mentioned how automation can bring the price down. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=949.12s)]
*  Are you able to speed up the process to bring the price down and also shrink the footprint, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=951.24s)]
*  the actual footprint to potentially bring price down as well? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=958.24s)]
*  Yeah, great questions. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=961.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=963.44s)]
*  So I think these processes are, they're very bespoke. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=964.44s)]
*  Every process has a lot of nuance. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=967.92s)]
*  You might have heard the phrase, the process is the product. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=969.32s)]
*  This is a lot of where the IP is, is where, how we develop these processes. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=971.6s)]
*  Today's standard process is about, let's say somewhere between seven to 10 days, you'll [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=976.16s)]
*  get kind of most cell therapy products falling within that range. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=980.52s)]
*  We think we can probably shave 30% off of a process. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=984.56s)]
*  So maybe three to two or three days off of a process in the current iteration and the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  kind of current constraints. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=992.64s)]
*  And that would definitely have significant savings from a cost of goods and labor perspective, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=994.88s)]
*  but also obviously returning the product back to a patient several days earlier. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=999.52s)]
*  These are very sick people. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1003.56s)]
*  You know, these are people that have been through, you know, many rounds of treatment [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1004.56s)]
*  unsuccessfully. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1008.04s)]
*  So time is of the essence. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1009.04s)]
*  So I think all of that could be a potentially a big benefit. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1010.52s)]
*  And the other one that you highlighted is very significant in that today we do these [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1014.8399999999999s)]
*  manufacturing processes in massive aircraft hangar size buildings, you know, GMP facilities [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1018.7199999999999s)]
*  that, you know, 100, 150,000 square feet. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1025.08s)]
*  They cost $150 million to build. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1029.04s)]
*  These are significant investments. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1031.6399999999999s)]
*  With the technology that we've developed, we're able to shrink the footprint of manufacturing [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1034.92s)]
*  dramatically. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1040.2s)]
*  So potentially using 95% less, so only 5% of the space to deliver the same number of [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1041.2s)]
*  doses a year. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1048.24s)]
*  Those manual processes we described earlier are quite space intensive. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1049.88s)]
*  You know, you have a lot of people moving around in a clean room. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  You can't do but so many doses in that same space. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  So you need more and more space. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1058.76s)]
*  You know, scale out, you've heard rather than scale up. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1059.92s)]
*  So scaling out can be very expensive because that square footage is very expensive. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1062.98s)]
*  So our hope is that it will dramatically reduce the footprint and the requirement for GMP [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1067.1s)]
*  clean room space with the platform as well. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1071.1s)]
*  Is it something that obviously the more people with cancer in bigger centers, so London, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1073.66s)]
*  New York, Paris, where real estate is at its most expensive, do you envisage being able [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1081.3s)]
*  say put something in rural Wyoming or in Scotland where it's cheaper to have that footprint [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1088.14s)]
*  to start with that would also save a lot of money, but then you're into transportation [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1095.5600000000002s)]
*  costs? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1100.26s)]
*  Yeah, this is a really kind of nuanced debate that's happening in the industry right now. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1101.26s)]
*  So as you know, most of the industry has grown up on what we call centralized manufacturing, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1105.96s)]
*  right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1111.6200000000001s)]
*  Big facility, big plant somewhere, stamping out tablets or making biologics. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1112.62s)]
*  And then we take those and we ship them out to the supply chain. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1117.4599999999998s)]
*  That's today's biopharma manufacturing model. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1119.9399999999998s)]
*  And that's the model we've applied to cell therapy, because that's what we know. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1123.34s)]
*  And that model doesn't make a huge amount of sense for personalized medicines. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1127.4199999999998s)]
*  If you're making a generic product that can serve any patient, it makes a lot of sense. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1131.6399999999999s)]
*  You get economies of scale. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1135.6999999999998s)]
*  But with this, it's sort of every dose is unique. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1136.82s)]
*  Every patient dose is different for that patient. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1139.86s)]
*  And it makes those economies of scale much, much harder to gain. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1142.86s)]
*  So what you've described, the theory of distributed manufacturing, can we take manufacturing out [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1145.5s)]
*  into the community, closer to the patient somewhere, is an idea that's gained a lot [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1151.1399999999999s)]
*  of traction in the industry. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1156.08s)]
*  I think we can all see the benefits of time savings, the logistics of shipping cells halfway [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1157.08s)]
*  across the world and all the complexity and cost of that isn't very appealing and isn't [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1162.6999999999998s)]
*  available. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1169.42s)]
*  So this is a potential solution. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1170.42s)]
*  It has its own challenges, certainly, because how do we batch release products that are [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1172.46s)]
*  manufactured in lots of different places is often how do we ensure that there's a quality [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1176.7800000000002s)]
*  system in place that makes sure that the patient is safe and the product's efficacious? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1181.3200000000002s)]
*  I think those challenges are overcomeable with the advent of technologies like ORIs [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1186.42s)]
*  and some of our partners. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1190.6200000000001s)]
*  We're partnering with software providers like a benchling, as an example, or a track cell [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1192.66s)]
*  where so long as the information and data quality is there, you could potentially batch [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1198.94s)]
*  release from one location products that are made in many locations. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1203.86s)]
*  So if you have a digital batch record, essentially all that a quality person, a QA or QC person [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1208.98s)]
*  at the end, qualified person in Europe would be doing, we're looking at the batch record. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1214.02s)]
*  Today it's on paper. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1217.98s)]
*  It's a thousand pages and they're leafing through it and they're saying, okay, there's [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1218.98s)]
*  a deviation. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1222.3s)]
*  Yep, I think that's okay. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1223.3s)]
*  Going through, going through, and eventually they sign it and there's like two or three [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1224.78s)]
*  people that have to review that documentation. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1227.46s)]
*  So that's all done by hand, effectively, all done on paper and all done at the site of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1229.42s)]
*  manufacture. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1237.1000000000001s)]
*  That's today's norm. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1238.1000000000001s)]
*  So you need enough quality people at that site physically to be able to do that work. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1239.38s)]
*  You can imagine a scenario where actually if this is a digital record, that you have [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1244.66s)]
*  a centralized repository, a centralized place where you're doing batch release, all of the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1248.46s)]
*  person needs to evaluate the batch and the quality is delivered to them digitally and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1254.22s)]
*  they can go through and they can evaluate it and then they could release it even if [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1259.06s)]
*  they're not there specifically on site. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1262.6599999999999s)]
*  And so you get economies of scale of those individuals who are very hard to find. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1264.86s)]
*  And then eventually, potentially you can do things like batch release by exception or [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1269.86s)]
*  continuous validation processes, which would, the system would essentially say, you know, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1274.86s)]
*  if it stays within this set of parameters, it's probably good to go. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1279.34s)]
*  And you just need someone to say yes. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1282.02s)]
*  So those kinds of advancements are coming and ORI's platform should help us take a [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1283.9s)]
*  large step in that direction. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1287.7s)]
*  We as a company are site of manufacture agnostic. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1289.9s)]
*  So if you're a pharma company, you've got a facility you want to manufacture there, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1293.3s)]
*  we can help increase the throughput, lower the costs in that facility that exists today. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1297.6200000000001s)]
*  Or if you want to build a distributed manufacturing network, which some of our partners are [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1302.18s)]
*  thinking about, then we can do that as well. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1306.14s)]
*  And I think our technology is uniquely sort of qualified to try and deliver that kind [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1309.02s)]
*  of network, you know, distributed network approach for the hopefully the near term future. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1313.18s)]
*  I would imagine that data collection and data analysis is becoming more and more important. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1317.74s)]
*  Could you tell me about the patient tracker that you've introduced? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1324.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So this was the genesis of me asking a dumb question, which is usually [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1327.7s)]
*  what happens. You know, I sort of said, well, how many patients have been treated with [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1332.26s)]
*  approved six CAR T products? That was the question, which are, as you know, you know, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1335.8999999999999s)]
*  yes, CARTA and Kimraya have been around the longest for five plus years now. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1340.6599999999999s)]
*  You've got Abecma and CARVICTI in the multiple myeloma space. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1344.9399999999998s)]
*  Then you've got Ticardis and Brianzi. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1348.6599999999999s)]
*  So there's six products that are approved that are CAR T products. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1350.9399999999998s)]
*  Mostly all of those are approved in the U.S. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1354.62s)]
*  And I just asked an innocent question to say, how many how many patients have been treated [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1356.98s)]
*  historically with these products? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1360.54s)]
*  And everyone sort of looked at me like, we don't know. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1362.62s)]
*  I said, well, can you try and find out? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1364.9399999999998s)]
*  We went out and did a bunch of research and no one could find the answer. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1366.1399999999999s)]
*  That's odd. You think this would be something that someone somewhere was tracking. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1369.4599999999998s)]
*  But I come to find that that's not the case. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1373.78s)]
*  It hasn't been a number that's been tracked. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1375.1799999999998s)]
*  It's sort of been estimated in lots of articles. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1376.78s)]
*  Oh, I think it's around 20,000. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1378.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, some of the thought leaders sort of have their their finger on the pulse, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1380.1399999999999s)]
*  but no one really knows. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1383.02s)]
*  So we have taken the public kind of disclosures, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1383.78s)]
*  quarterly disclosures from all of the companies that market those products are publicly listed. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1388.74s)]
*  So they have disclosed information quarterly on sales. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1393.98s)]
*  And very creatively, we've taken total sales divided by kind of gross price [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1398.34s)]
*  to get a rough metric of how many patients have been treated. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1403.26s)]
*  Now, it's specifically wrong, but probably directionally correct. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1406.06s)]
*  As we say, you know, we're looking really looking at trends like how many more [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1410.34s)]
*  patients are getting treated year over year. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1413.42s)]
*  So there's there's good news and bad news with that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1416.1s)]
*  The bad news is, you know, throughout our history for the last six years of having [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1418.22s)]
*  available products, we've only treated around 20,000 patients. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1422.38s)]
*  And that represents about three percent of the patient population [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1426.3s)]
*  that could have benefited from those therapies. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1429.66s)]
*  So that's a relatively low number. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1432.14s)]
*  And as I've already articulated, or he has an ambition to try and help that. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1434.06s)]
*  But the good news is that we are on track this year to double [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1439.6200000000001s)]
*  the number of patients that we treated last year. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1442.46s)]
*  So last year in total, we treated about a little bit less than seven thousand. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1444.06s)]
*  So it's called sixty seven hundred or so. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1448.18s)]
*  Maybe not double up by 50 percent. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1451.02s)]
*  So this year we're on track to treat between eight and nine thousand. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1452.74s)]
*  So it's a healthy increase. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1455.42s)]
*  But again, it leaves a large gap in the patients that could have benefited, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1458.74s)]
*  but weren't able to get treatment. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1463.78s)]
*  And unfortunately, in this world, because these are last line therapies, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1465.22s)]
*  the patients who don't get this option often have the worst outcome. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1470.74s)]
*  There is really no other options available to them. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1473.74s)]
*  So that's why kind of this, you know, enabling widespread access, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1476.7s)]
*  such an important goal for the company. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1479.46s)]
*  Clearly, we're at a point where more people are getting cancer. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1482.9s)]
*  So demand is increasing. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1486.58s)]
*  If you're able to get costs down and get more people treatments, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1489.3s)]
*  at what point do you think that we will start to see those [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1495.66s)]
*  that imbalance improve? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1500.3400000000001s)]
*  If I were to dust off my crystal ball and try and future gaze, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1503.18s)]
*  my hope is that within the next five years, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1506.86s)]
*  you'll see the products that exist today much more widely available. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1509.78s)]
*  So many more products available. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the competition will kind of introduce some pricing pressure [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1517.6999999999998s)]
*  so that instead of costing half a million dollars or, you know, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1521.1s)]
*  some of these gene therapies cost almost three or four million dollars [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1524.8999999999999s)]
*  each for each patient. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1527.86s)]
*  So some of those prices might come down and then you might get earlier access. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1529.9399999999998s)]
*  And so you get this overall more patients get treated. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1533.1s)]
*  And also, you know, I think we expect to see many more products approved. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1536.42s)]
*  You know, we're looking towards the end of this year. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1540.9s)]
*  Vertex and CRISPR could have a very interesting product [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1544.34s)]
*  approved as first of its kind. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  I think it's Iovet is going to have a till product. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1550.58s)]
*  So it's a solid tumor product that's targeted towards melanoma. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1553.22s)]
*  So you're seeing some, you know, the ones that exist today are mostly [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1557.5s)]
*  hematological tumors, so blood cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1560.82s)]
*  Those are the approved products. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1565.62s)]
*  Solid tumors thus far have been elusive. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1567.1s)]
*  You know, these are much harder to penetrate and get into the tumor. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1569.34s)]
*  We're starting to see some new products come out, you know, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1572.4599999999998s)]
*  towards the end of this year and next year. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1574.62s)]
*  So in the next five years, we should have, I would venture to say, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1576.02s)]
*  tens of more products available. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1580.1399999999999s)]
*  And hopefully we'll have the technology infrastructure [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1583.5s)]
*  that supports the delivery of those products to a much larger number of patients. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1586.6999999999998s)]
*  That would be my hope. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1590.7399999999998s)]
*  And certainly within the 10 year time frame, you know, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1591.54s)]
*  we could be potentially curing cancer in a very large number of patients [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1593.62s)]
*  if things go well. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1598.4199999999998s)]
*  It's good news. Yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1600.5s)]
*  I hope so. Yeah. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1602.1s)]
*  How is your company able to obviously you got to make money as well. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1603.2199999999998s)]
*  But how do you sort of assist in that facilitating that process? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1607.1s)]
*  Yeah. So we we have five partners we're currently working with [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1611.62s)]
*  that have the platform kind of on site or they're working with it with us. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1614.86s)]
*  And really, it starts with a collaboration of trying to understand [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1619.9399999999998s)]
*  their manufacturing process, looking at what they currently have [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1622.78s)]
*  and then translating that over onto the platform. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1626.02s)]
*  That's the kind of first stage. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1629.22s)]
*  And then we do some feasibility work because ultimately [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1630.66s)]
*  Ori is a biology first company. We are focused on biology. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1633.26s)]
*  We've been working on biology very diligently for the last four years [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1636.5s)]
*  because that's where the industry starts. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1640.7s)]
*  That's where our partners start. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1642.1s)]
*  When they think about this, this challenge, they think about the biology first. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1643.18s)]
*  Ultimately, we have to start there, but we also need to keep that end game in mind. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1646.74s)]
*  We can't only focus on biology and lose the kind of piece around. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1650.18s)]
*  How do we get this to lots of patients? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1654.94s)]
*  You know, we need to make sure whatever process we develop is scalable. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1656.3400000000001s)]
*  So we start with the biology. We replicate their process. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1658.74s)]
*  We've had very, very good results with some of our initial partners [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1662.3400000000001s)]
*  being able to very quickly replicate or most often surpass [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1664.7800000000002s)]
*  the results they have with their existing process. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1669.3400000000001s)]
*  So today they'll be using those manual lab tools we were talking about. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1672.14s)]
*  And they will have been working on those for years, you know, two, three, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1675.7s)]
*  four or five years. They've been perfecting that process. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1678.42s)]
*  And within for the first couple of partners we've worked with within a month, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1681.5800000000002s)]
*  we are on par or better than that process. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1685.02s)]
*  So that's a great showcase of how we're able to adapt the technology [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1687.38s)]
*  to the needs of the process versus trying to shoehorn the process [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1691.38s)]
*  into the limitations of the technology. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1694.8200000000002s)]
*  So once we get that right, then the question is, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1697.18s)]
*  how do we then prove the scalability? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1700.26s)]
*  So it's, you know, can we repeatedly and reliably put cells [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1701.98s)]
*  through that platform and get the same result out the other side? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1705.8200000000002s)]
*  And that's really where we're going to be over the next 12, you know, 15 months. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1708.26s)]
*  Our hope is that we'll be in clinical trials with a few partners. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1712.66s)]
*  So towards the back half of next year, if not early 25, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1715.34s)]
*  where we'll begin to see first clinical use. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1719.26s)]
*  So patients will be treated with the therapeutic that comes off of the ORI platform, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1722.42s)]
*  which will be a day to celebrate for us for sure. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1726.26s)]
*  You know, there's been for some five or even longer, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1729.22s)]
*  seven years of hard work to try and get to that point. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1732.14s)]
*  So that's how we would make an impact. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1734.34s)]
*  Working closely with therapy developers, CDMOs, academic researchers [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1736.62s)]
*  to develop these products and then bring them into the clinic as quickly as we can [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1741.34s)]
*  and then get them to patients, get them approved and get them to commercial scale. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1745.6999999999998s)]
*  That's really our role as a partner to the industry is to enable that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1750.1799999999998s)]
*  to happen as quickly and as safely as possible. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1753.06s)]
*  And I assume that you're constantly or that your own platform is constantly evolving. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1755.54s)]
*  It is. I mean, we've been really kind of R&D focused for the last four years. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1762.1s)]
*  We've trialed it with, I think, nine partners now, five or six therapy developers, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1766.98s)]
*  a couple of CDMOs, MD Anderson as a partner. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1772.34s)]
*  So we're working with MD Anderson to make sure we've got the right tools, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1774.6599999999999s)]
*  that it's the right technology and it's not overly restrictive or that it's fit for purpose. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1778.3s)]
*  We're highly confident that it meets the need that our partners have. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1783.22s)]
*  So that process is underway, has been going on, is coming to a completion. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1786.6999999999998s)]
*  In the next, let's say, six to nine months, we will block the design. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1791.22s)]
*  We'll move, we'll transfer into manufacturing and then we'll look to make it [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1794.74s)]
*  commercially available at the end of next year so people can start to purchase [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1799.02s)]
*  the platform and develop their own products on it, which will be an exciting time for us. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1803.58s)]
*  So, yeah, we're moving from an R&D focus really to a commercial launch focus [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1807.66s)]
*  and getting the product out there in the hands of the industry that needs it [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1812.98s)]
*  to make these incredible products. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1815.46s)]
*  So I assume that your company will change a lot over the next 12 to 18 months. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  It will, it will. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1823.8200000000002s)]
*  We're scaling up, you know, the staff. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1824.9s)]
*  We've got, I think, 10 people in the US now. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1827.1000000000001s)]
*  We'll kind of build that team up because a lot of the customers that we'll be [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1829.46s)]
*  working with are US based, so we'll have to kind of make the leap across the pond. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1832.1000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of our team that we're hiring, they're experts in product development. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1836.9s)]
*  So they will have worked at therapy developers developing these therapies, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1842.8600000000001s)]
*  they're biologists, they're technical operations people, they're MSAT people. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1846.22s)]
*  They really understand this process fundamentally so that they can partner [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1850.14s)]
*  with our customers to make sure that their processes go as quickly and as [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1854.78s)]
*  easily as possible through that journey. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1858.66s)]
*  So hiring those people, deploying them in the right places, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1861.14s)]
*  it's no easy puzzle to unlock. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1865.22s)]
*  But I think our approach in that way is different from most technology companies. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1867.18s)]
*  We are providing not only the technology, but also the knowledge and the know-how [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1871.3s)]
*  and the value added service on top of it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1874.78s)]
*  And in addition to that, we're partnering with CDMO partners like the Cell [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1877.86s)]
*  Therapy Manufacturing Center down in Houston, like potentially even the Cell [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1882.26s)]
*  and Gene Therapy Catapult here in the UK to leverage their expertise [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1886.4599999999998s)]
*  alongside the platform. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1890.8999999999999s)]
*  So they become essentially centers of excellence who really understand the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1892.02s)]
*  technology and then they bring their own expertise to the challenges [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1895.02s)]
*  that our shared partners have as therapy developers. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1899.9799999999998s)]
*  So we don't want to be a CDMO. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1902.9399999999998s)]
*  We don't want to be a service provider. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1904.1799999999998s)]
*  We don't think that makes sense for us. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1905.54s)]
*  We want to partner with those experts, those CDMOs that already have the [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1908.06s)]
*  capability and allow them to do their job that much better, that much quicker, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1911.74s)]
*  that much more efficiently to develop these products, get them into clinical [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1916.26s)]
*  trials and get them to patients. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1919.26s)]
*  We're on the hunt. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1921.18s)]
*  We are conquering cancer, one disease indication at a time. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1921.82s)]
*  Pretty soon it's melanoma. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1925.82s)]
*  We know we have partners are looking at lung cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1928.62s)]
*  cancer, a lot of these diseases are intractable. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1933.06s)]
*  They don't really have good treatments today. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1936.1799999999998s)]
*  And you can sort of see the near term vision five years from now, seven years [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1938.74s)]
*  from now, 10 years from now, we have potentially curative interventions [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1943.1399999999999s)]
*  for those diseases. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1946.86s)]
*  So certainly a lot of optimism coming from us at this point. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1947.98s)]
*  When you talk about curing cancer, I think that certainly it's improved, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1951.58s)]
*  but still the most or the best way to prevent it is to catch it early. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1955.98s)]
*  Whereas that isn't always the case. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1962.98s)]
*  So having solutions that can treat people later on is important. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1965.78s)]
*  Well, and also kind of the full spectrum, I think, you know, having, you know, these [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1972.94s)]
*  are very clinically effective interventions. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1976.06s)]
*  We think about the way we do it today. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1979.06s)]
*  It's a little bit counterintuitive, right? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1980.7s)]
*  So we we wait until a patient is as sick as they could possibly be. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1982.5s)]
*  We harvest their immune cells, we turn that immune, those immune cells into a [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1987.86s)]
*  therapeutic and very frequently, more frequently than not, that therapeutic is [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1990.94s)]
*  clinically effective. But you can imagine if we would do that much, much earlier, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1995.66s)]
*  how much more effective it could be and potentially lower side effects, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=1999.8600000000001s)]
*  you know, lower costs for the system if you were to intervene earlier. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2004.3s)]
*  So I think it's really trying to understand, you know, where on the continuum of care [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2008.18s)]
*  this kind of intervention makes the most sense. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2012.22s)]
*  And if we can make it much more affordable, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2014.1000000000001s)]
*  we'll start to see it used much earlier line therapy. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2016.74s)]
*  I mean, there's no clinical or safety reason why they should be restricted access, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2018.9s)]
*  why they should be last line. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2022.5800000000002s)]
*  It's more of a commercial cost reason that we just can't afford to make [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2024.22s)]
*  them widely available for everyone today. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2028.3000000000002s)]
*  But hopefully that trade off doesn't have to be made, you know, in the future. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2030.3000000000002s)]
*  We can actually make the products affordably and they can be accessible [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2033.5400000000002s)]
*  to all the patients for whom they're clinically indicated. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2037.46s)]
*  But Tite and others have proven certainly at second line that these therapies [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2040.02s)]
*  are more effective than the standard of care. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2044.7800000000002s)]
*  And they're now starting to look at, you know, the first line chemo. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2047.26s)]
*  Chemo is cheap in the whole scheme of things. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2050.62s)]
*  And we know how detrimental it is to a patient. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2053.42s)]
*  But from an intervention perspective, it's relatively cheap and relatively [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2056.66s)]
*  effective most of the time. So it remains first line. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2059.86s)]
*  I met a lady called Lucy Alerke Jones, whose her son, Opie, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2062.86s)]
*  was one of the first pediatric CAR T patients in the UK. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2067.54s)]
*  So he was one year old, I think, when he was diagnosed and received [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2071.26s)]
*  CAR T therapy shortly after. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2074.18s)]
*  And they started something called the Opie Jones Foundation to support families [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2076.02s)]
*  who are who are going through CAR T. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2080.02s)]
*  But Lucy told me that, you know, I didn't know this. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2082.22s)]
*  I should have, but didn't for particularly young patients. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2084.26s)]
*  Chemo has potentially significant long term detrimental side effects [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2089.26s)]
*  at the time when you're sort of like, well, they might die if they don't have it. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2094.3s)]
*  That's the only real option. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2097.06s)]
*  But potentially, chemotherapy can render children or patients [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2098.18s)]
*  sterile, you know, unable to have children in the future. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2102.62s)]
*  And that's just one of the negative consequences of the current standard of care. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2105.7400000000002s)]
*  And again, if that's all you got in the patient's going to die otherwise, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2109.34s)]
*  that's what you do. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2112.42s)]
*  But, you know, the way she she turns it is CAR T was much kinder. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2113.78s)]
*  It was a much kinder therapy. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2117.62s)]
*  The side effects were much less, at least in her experience. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2119.1800000000003s)]
*  And they had a good clinical result. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2121.7000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, I think that's what we all hope is that we really grapple. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2123.42s)]
*  We understand better how to deploy this modality to get that clinical benefit [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2125.94s)]
*  in a cost effective way without all the side effects and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2131.2200000000003s)]
*  other health care or hospitalization needs around it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2134.8999999999996s)]
*  But again, causes for optimism. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2137.8999999999996s)]
*  I think we're learning more and more about the modality. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2140.14s)]
*  We're still in the relatively early phases. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2143.2999999999997s)]
*  It's one of those overnight successes that's taken 30 years. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2145.7s)]
*  But as far as deploying this in patients and really understanding [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2148.66s)]
*  how patients react to this kind of therapy, the end isn't very big. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2151.62s)]
*  We haven't been doing this very long. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2155.3399999999997s)]
*  So we'll get better from here. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2157.06s)]
*  And I think that's a positive for humanity as a whole. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2158.22s)]
*  And not only for developed countries that can afford these products. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2162.42s)]
*  I think there's six billion other people in the world who live in the developed [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2166.14s)]
*  and developing countries that also should have access to these. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2169.94s)]
*  So I know there's some great work going on in India. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2173.66s)]
*  We have some investors from the Middle East who are interested [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2175.54s)]
*  in bringing CAR T therapy there. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2177.58s)]
*  So hopefully we do our job right. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2179.5s)]
*  This should be accessible not only in the developed world, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2180.98s)]
*  but all over the world. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2183.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's a super exciting prospect. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2184.7799999999997s)]
*  It's always good to talk about how more patients with terrible diseases [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2186.14s)]
*  can be better served, which is always the bottom line. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2190.54s)]
*  Just a reminder to check out the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2193.58s)]
*  And I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2199.02s)]
*  Thanks for listening. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2202.74s)]
*  And we hope you will join us next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniIBPF2Z-U&t=2203.8599999999997s)]
