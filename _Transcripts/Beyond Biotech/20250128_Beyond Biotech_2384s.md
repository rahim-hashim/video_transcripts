Video Description: The field of radiotherapeutics is a hot topic currently, and so who better to talk about the subject than Ken Herrmann, a radiopharmaceutical academic expert, who is Professor of Nuclear Medicine at the Universitätsklinikum Essen, in Essen Germany, and two people from the company Molecular Partners: Patrick Amstutz, who is a co-founder and the CEO, and Dani Steiner, SVP of R&D.


Molecular Partners recently shared a preclinical package supporting MP0712, its radioligand candidate. Based on the small protein class they pioneered, DARPins, the company is looking to tackle the historic kidney toxicity of small protein vectors while preserving a good binding and specificity profile. 


This will have repercussions across its radioligand (or Radio-DARPin) portfolio, which has programs in partnership with Novartis and (in the case of MP0712) Orano Med. MP0712's key tumor target is DLL3, also the target of tarlatamab, the first bispecific against DLL3, which was approved recently. 


The program is focused on small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), a highly aggressive lung cancer with a five-year survival rate of about 3%. Molecular Partners said its data show strong and homogenous tumor uptake of 212PB-DLL3 targeted MP0712, as well as significant and durable inhibition of tumor growth. 


The data also show good tolerance at all dosing levels and an enhanced tumor-to-kidney uptake ratio. MP0712 is the first Radio-DARPin expected to enter the clinic with first-in-human data expected in 2025.

# The radiotherapeutics boom
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 102. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. It's a little bit different this week in that there are [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=18.0s)]
*  three guests all covering the same subject, which is radiopharmaceuticals. It's a hot topic currently [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=23.86s)]
*  and so who better to talk about the subject than Ken Herrmann, a radiopharmaceutical academic expert [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=31.42s)]
*  and he is professor of nuclear medicine at the Universitätsklinikum Essen in Essen, Germany. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=39.06s)]
*  And there are two people from the Swiss biotech company Molecular Partners and they are Patrick [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  Amstutz who is a co-founder and the CEO and Danny Steiner, SVP of R&D. In our wide-ranging [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=53.54s)]
*  conversation you will hear first from Patrick Amstutz, then Ken Herrmann and last but not least [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=63.54s)]
*  Danny Steiner. I wonder if to get things started I could get a little bit of background on Molecular Partners. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=70.1s)]
*  Sure, I think I can take that one as a co-founder of the company. So I think there's two things, one is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=78.58s)]
*  Molecular Partners and the other is our DARPIN technology or DARPIN modality. And now actually I think [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=86.34s)]
*  I will start with the DARPIN modality because the company was founded because of the opportunity [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  of the modality and there is some logic to it. So in the late 90s we were working in the group of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=99.86s)]
*  Andreas Plügtun, an antibody engineer and we saw limitations of antibodies and antibodies are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  really great molecules. They bind their targets specifically, they have unique stability and a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  lot of functions but they're very large and complex. So one antibody is four proteins actually in 12 [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=121.86s)]
*  domains and we were interested in what had nature evolved next to antibodies as binding domains and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=129.46s)]
*  we found a whole class of proteins called repeat proteins and that goes back to the genome sequencing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=138.5s)]
*  efforts when one could back then really mine those genomes and that's where we found [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=146.18s)]
*  anchoring repeat proteins, leucine-rich repeat proteins and also other repeat proteins. And we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=151.94s)]
*  chose the anchoring repeat protein and built the designed anchoring repeat protein, in short the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=158.26s)]
*  DARPIN. And the DARPIN is the tenth the size of an antibody, small, stable, one protein, one domain [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  and it shares the high specificity and affinity of the antibody. And so with that the idea was [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=174.26s)]
*  born to create a novel therapeutic modality so we were not interested more in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  calling diagnostics or tools but we said let's really use this novel modality to make therapies [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=188.34s)]
*  and we always had two ways forward and the idea was always not to be an antibody because antibodies [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  are great so let's do things others don't and one is super small simple high affinity binding in one [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=202.74s)]
*  domain and the other is multi-specificity. I mean just we were joking before about the football cop [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=211.38s)]
*  that's the team so build a team of domains to fight the disease and we have ventured into both [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=218.9s)]
*  and that's where molecular partners comes in so we have built a team of experts around the idea [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=226.5s)]
*  that and our slogan is make drugs that matter so use the DARPIN modality to make drugs that help [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=231.94s)]
*  patients so high medical need ideally single agent active and so far we have brought seven [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=239.54s)]
*  DARPIN candidates to the clinic we have treated more than two and a half thousand patients and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=246.98s)]
*  we're really excited now to be in the radiotherapy space with support of Ken who is also here on the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  call. I wonder if you can give me a bit more background on radiotherapeutics and radiopharma [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=259.06s)]
*  how it actually works and what kind of disease is it suitable to tackle? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=265.86s)]
*  Jim is a perfect assist for me so I'm a nuclear medicine physician and the truth is that in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  nuclear medicine we use radioactive substances for imaging as well as for therapy for many many years [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  and indeed the concept of using one radioactive substance iodine for diagnostic imaging but also [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=279.94s)]
*  therapy of both cancer but also benign cell disease dates back to 1940 Saul Hertz was the person who [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=286.66s)]
*  first implemented this now this being said both radioactivity and also a nuclear medicine doesn't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=293.86s)]
*  sound very let's say fashionable and this I think is what happened in the early 2000s when people [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=299.14s)]
*  were looking for a new term and this new phanostics real synostics they came up the idea behind is the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=304.18s)]
*  same we want to target one specific structure and deliver the radioactivity the radioactive radiation [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=309.86s)]
*  very precisely to this a very dedicated structure and as an example and this is one of the most [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  known one is actually prostate cancer then prostate cancer such a target which is highly [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=323.22s)]
*  expressed in prostate cancer and almost not at all in other healthy tissues is the prostate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  specific membrane antigen psma and for this target they have now discovered the ligand which binds [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=332.5s)]
*  with a very high affinity to this target and all we have to do then is to use this ligand make it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=337.62s)]
*  radioactively hot we can use diagnostic radionuclides for doing imaging or therapeutic ones for therapy [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  and this is actually the big big breakthrough for full disclosure between cyroids 1940 and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=350.1s)]
*  provicto which is a medication for prostate cancer in 2022 there are also a couple of other therapies [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=357.14000000000004s)]
*  in between but not many but just to mention very quickly glutathera targeting somatostatin 2 receptor [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  and neonuclein tumors and also radium 223 targeting bone metastasis especially prostate cancer and your [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=369.06s)]
*  question was what are the tumors for the future i think something that you're going to discuss in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=376.42s)]
*  the next minutes about but of course the big aim is now after neonuclein tumors and prostate cancer [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=380.98s)]
*  to also advance into other very important solid tumors and my dream there is of course gi tumors [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=386.18s)]
*  lung cancer and breast cancer what are some of the challenges that you face or some of the obstacles [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=392.1s)]
*  for radiopharma innovation so now being the longest in the field i will take this one as well [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=399.38s)]
*  a big big problem is obviously the commercial success so around 2000 there were two really [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=406.1s)]
*  really interesting antibodies for lymphoma different kinds of lymphoma and even so that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=411.70000000000005s)]
*  they were medically very very successful they were never commercially successful and the reasons of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  them are multiple but one of them first of all it's important that a therapy which includes [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=421.3s)]
*  reactivity has a certain shelf life so we cannot just store it on the bench and then keep it and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=426.18s)]
*  eventually use it once we use it dedicate they lose activity over time they logistically a little [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=431.62s)]
*  bit more complex and then the third and i think the most important part is that for a very long [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=436.82s)]
*  time we also were not able to gather enough convincing data so when you go nowadays into [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=441.38s)]
*  your tumor board and you want to actually convince our clinical fellows to send you a patient you [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=447.62s)]
*  need to deliver prospective phase three data and the truth is that for a very very long field [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=452.82s)]
*  nuclear medicine and the center of the community did not succeed in performing this perspective [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  a phase three data and i think this is one of the biggest consequences of the recent successes now [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  that we see more and more people who really have a lot of experience in drug development [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=468.26s)]
*  entering the space and moving forward and this is maybe also something where i would like to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  directly hand back to our friends from medical partners while they see the space and how they [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=477.46s)]
*  are going to help me and my colleagues to actually overcome the hurdles which i just mentioned [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=482.82s)]
*  ken i will hand over to donnie for more the technical parts but one point i found interesting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=486.82s)]
*  because 2007 we first time looked into this and what ken was mentioning before with the supply [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  chain that he would sort of deliver overnight 2007 that was just let's say a dream and i do [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=500.18s)]
*  think over the last 10 years including covid where this amazon i order one day the next day i get it [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  delivered i think this has really changed how we think about supply chains in general not only [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=513.86s)]
*  for radiotherapy and then the other one the the car t-space where you make individualized product [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=519.86s)]
*  for a single patient so those two things the idea of you can actually manufacture for a single patient [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=527.0600000000001s)]
*  and you have an ability to deliver whatever you want the book or a part of your bicycle overnight [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=534.02s)]
*  together really opened the space for radiotherapy so i think those are for me sort of the simple [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=542.02s)]
*  general things where society has a different expectation and i'll now hand over to donnie [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=548.34s)]
*  to go now more into the technical parts what does radiotherapy need what are we solving for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=553.78s)]
*  and what are the now more technical obstacles happy to take that question and maybe i start from [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=560.34s)]
*  where ken already nicely summarized so the overarching ambitions of course to now [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=566.26s)]
*  translate or expand that great success that has been seen for psma or somatostatin receptors [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=572.5s)]
*  into as many as possible other tumor indications and starting there from the underlying requirement [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=578.9799999999999s)]
*  you need of course the radioactive part but on the other side you need targeting moieties that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=586.42s)]
*  address the requirements of delivering the radioactivity very specifically to the tumor [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=591.46s)]
*  while sparing the dose limiting critical organs which are on one side the kidney very often and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=597.7s)]
*  on the other side the bone marrow leading to bone marrow toxicity and that's whenever you have targets [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=604.1s)]
*  which have like pockets where you can identify such small molecular weight ligands like psma or [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=609.86s)]
*  somatostatin receptor there is like you go with these low molecular weight ligands they're perfect [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=616.9s)]
*  they're quickly into the system they quickly leave the system again accumulate high on the tumor and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=621.78s)]
*  then ideally stay long enough to deposit the energy on the tumor but the problem is this space [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=626.74s)]
*  of targets or the number of targets that can be addressed this way is very limited there is only [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=632.02s)]
*  a few of these targets available and that's why people have been looking into expanding this using [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=636.66s)]
*  more classical i say targeting moieties to expand that space using on one side antibodies small [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=642.42s)]
*  proteins like diapines or then peptides and cyclic peptides however the problem is all of them bring [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=649.54s)]
*  limitations the antibodies very long duration in circulation leading to a lot of decay of the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=656.26s)]
*  radioactivity in circulation often also limited by tumor penetration still some companies and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  teams are following this avenue then cyclic peptides as well leading to often high kidney [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=667.7s)]
*  accumulation and also challenging to generate against certain targets and then the small proteins [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=673.7s)]
*  where you see on one side they lead to high kidney accumulation as well and have somehow mediocre i [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=680.58s)]
*  say tumor accumulation that's exactly where we've been seeing the opportunity for diapines to figure [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=687.1400000000001s)]
*  out solutions that would overcome these limitations has there been a shortage of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  radio ligands and has that been the challenge that's a very important point jim you mentioned [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=699.86s)]
*  that the big challenge has been for a certain time the excess to re-nuclides there are a couple [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=705.86s)]
*  of reasons and this has been not only for the therapeutic ones also for diagnostic ones because [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=710.9s)]
*  some of the reactors are very old then they needed to be undergoing maintenance then some of them [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=715.22s)]
*  were shut down because of unexpected need of maintenance this is one of the things which [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=721.38s)]
*  people always think about when they talk about supply chain shortages the second one of course [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=726.74s)]
*  is a big issue novartis as a front runner eventually had when one of their production [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=731.62s)]
*  sites was actually shut down and the other one was not opened yet it to be fully honest this is [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=736.74s)]
*  the growing pains which a field has and this was very nice outlined by patches by danny but i think [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=742.18s)]
*  we have overcome these growing pains now we see that novartis as a front runner has really matured [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=748.66s)]
*  they now have a couple of production sites i think for the future the access to plovictum [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=754.98s)]
*  jothera of the proof products is figured out we also see a lot of investments into different layers [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  of supply chain which means on one side the production of the re-nuclides i mentioned [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=766.3399999999999s)]
*  very quickly here actinium lead also terbium but we also see a lot of investment into labeling [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=770.9s)]
*  capacity so-called cdmo's contract manufacturing and we also see a lot of investment actually also [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=777.06s)]
*  in into companies who really specialize in the logistics so yes it's a very well taken point [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=782.7399999999999s)]
*  there have been significant challenges in the field but i think overall in the last five years [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=787.6199999999999s)]
*  the field of theranostics has matured significantly and will continue to mature [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  over the next development cycles and how have you kind of taken that on at molecular partners i guess [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=797.8599999999999s)]
*  with your own technology i can just give sort of the intro and then hand over to danny for the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=804.5s)]
*  technical solid solutions but we actually had a very successful covet program with novartis three [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=809.94s)]
*  years ago and novartis told us hey your small proteins would be ideal vectors for this approach [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=816.74s)]
*  and so we looked at it and then we said okay what do we need to solve we need to get high affinity [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=823.14s)]
*  specificity we have to get a lot on the tumor and little in the kidney we don't have that yet [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=829.46s)]
*  so we need to work on those two dimensions and in the last three years that's what the team [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=834.98s)]
*  with danny has done and maybe you can give us some background on how we actually solved first maybe [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=840.1s)]
*  the kidney accumulation so no kidney accumulation and then second how we bring more darken into the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=845.94s)]
*  happy to do so so that's as i mentioned that's like for any of the small proteins which you can [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=853.22s)]
*  use to target a very broad class of tumor antigens of tumor targets you have these two same overlying [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=859.94s)]
*  challenges to address and that's where we've seen looking at these challenges and understanding the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=866.6600000000001s)]
*  properties of the diapines very well that we felt like from the start there would be good ways how [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=872.02s)]
*  to address this so the first one the kidney that's where we we used an approach and maybe [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=877.3s)]
*  i need to quickly go a bit into the background for those who are not so well aware of the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=882.18s)]
*  of the scientific aspect of this field is like the kidney basically whatever whenever you have a small [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=886.9s)]
*  protein or a peptide that is excreted into the primary urine should go into the urine the kidney [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=893.54s)]
*  has established a very efficient mechanism to reabsorb that protein source to not lose that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=900.5799999999999s)]
*  protein source or nitrogen source from the body and that's where we realized that reabsorption [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=907.22s)]
*  and mechanism by a heavy re-engineering of the surface surface of the diapine which is [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=912.5s)]
*  enabled by its very high stability would lead to what we call a stealth diapine that is instead of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=918.6600000000001s)]
*  being reabsorbed in the kidney going directly into the urine and can be excreted by the individual [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=923.7s)]
*  so that was the first avenue to solve the kidney aspect and the second avenue to solve the tumor [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=928.74s)]
*  uptake aspect it's on one side we knew since a long time that high affinity helps to get high [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=934.42s)]
*  tumor uptake but we realized that on its own is not really sufficient enough to get good enough [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=940.74s)]
*  loading of the tumor enough energy onto the tumor to get an effective tumor kill and that's where [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=946.66s)]
*  we started to build a platform for slightly increasing the systemic circulation time of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=951.86s)]
*  diapines in order to get more loading onto the tumor we've heavily invested to get this done in [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=959.38s)]
*  a way that the blood levels are not strongly going up but the tumor is really driven up to high levels [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=966.02s)]
*  and this is the basis which we established and also enabled now our first molecule in the context [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=971.62s)]
*  of dll3 as a target and lead 212 as a radioactive payload to be moved into the clinic and i think [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=978.18s)]
*  really that this mq 712 is like is on one side it's of course a great drug moving forward and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=985.46s)]
*  on the other side it's unlocking to do many more targets now in the same context i guess recently [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=992.26s)]
*  you were at the sn mmi conference i wonder if you could tell me a little bit about that and [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=999.22s)]
*  what it addressed and your participation in that so snmi is actually the most important conference [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1005.46s)]
*  in the field of nuclear medicine it's a place to be if we have something really exciting about [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1012.18s)]
*  aryothinostics to present that's why i'm really curious to hear from danny what molecular partners [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1016.8199999999999s)]
*  had to share with us there yeah that's what i i was already rooting to is like at snli we presented [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1022.42s)]
*  the first update basically the pre-clinical data package of our 212 led dll3 targeted radio diapine [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1028.6599999999999s)]
*  so maybe quickly trying to dissect the molecule here and give you a bit of background dll3 is [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1038.1s)]
*  applied because they're very highly expressed in small cell lung cancer so a lot of high prevalence [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1043.78s)]
*  and there is of course now other dll3 moieties like thalassema are moving forward this is a t-cell [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1050.18s)]
*  engager which delivers great benefit to the patient but at the same time you see there is [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1056.02s)]
*  only a 40 response rate so there's a lot of patients that still have a high medical need [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1060.5s)]
*  you can imagine especially those patients where you don't have t cells or no functional t cells [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1065.54s)]
*  in the tumor they will not respond so there is clear medical need for other dll3 targeting or [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1070.66s)]
*  targeting reagents with other payloads to deliver greater benefit to these patients and that's what [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1077.22s)]
*  we've been aiming for generating a dll3 specific diapine with all the features i explained you [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1082.18s)]
*  before like the surface engineering stealth engineering and the half-life extension and hooking [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1088.58s)]
*  up these is up to lead 2 1 2 which is an alpha emitting or a precursor of an alpha emitting [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1093.38s)]
*  particle which has shown and we're doing that together with oranumid and the legs 2 1 2 has [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1100.5s)]
*  shown very great success in the clinics the first data or the phase 2 data that has been presented [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1106.0200000000002s)]
*  at asco strong clinical data in terms of efficacy and safety so that's basically now we're starting [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1113.46s)]
*  round and we've presented now at smmi the data showing on one side good safety high potency of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1119.22s)]
*  the molecules comparing also to benchmark antibodies like the antibody derived from rova t [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1127.06s)]
*  and of course strong bio distribution profile speaking for moving this molecule into clinical [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1132.9s)]
*  development reaching up to 60 injected those on the tumor at 24 hours so really strong data [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1138.98s)]
*  package that convinced us and many experts like 10 to move forward with that molecule into the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1146.18s)]
*  clinics there was so many talks about psma sstr2 and not many of new targets and that's what i [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1151.54s)]
*  heard you're standing out you're going after other targets and obviously as donnie said dll3 is just [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1160.5800000000002s)]
*  the start of it and we we are not bound to the classical targets and this is the reason we went [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1166.5s)]
*  into this field was to work on targets others will not and that you could see at snmi this [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1173.62s)]
*  was one of the few talks that was not on the classical targets my questions when you talk [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1179.86s)]
*  about dll3 it's very difficult to ignore talatamep and i would like to hear your position on talatamep [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1185.6999999999998s)]
*  is this a good thing because molecular partners we also have t-cell engagers so i'm not speaking [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1191.86s)]
*  against amgen i just speak out of our own experience here with t-cell engagers and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1197.6999999999998s)]
*  i mean the whole field of immune oncology is great the idea to harness the patient's immune [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1203.62s)]
*  system to kill the tumor is great and in some cases that means cure now the problem is and we [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1208.6599999999999s)]
*  have our own trials you are very at the mercy of the immune system of the patient as donnie said [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1215.6999999999998s)]
*  are the t-cells there is the tumor what we would say hot are these t-cells activation can you [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1222.74s)]
*  activate them or they are they exhausted and to that point you don't control it and what i [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1228.74s)]
*  personally like a lot about the radio space is that it is sort of the other side radioactivity [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1235.14s)]
*  is a proven modality targeting is a proven modality together we don't expect the dependence on the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1241.46s)]
*  patient's immune system for those patients that need it and that's the beauty here this is known [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1248.82s)]
*  that actually radiation can boost the immune system so there might be a space in the future [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1256.74s)]
*  where we use radiotherapy to get the immune system running and then come in with t-cell engagers [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1262.1799999999998s)]
*  other i.o. drugs to use the activation the immune cells that we have generated with radiotherapy [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1268.74s)]
*  and would you say that the approval of teletermap is kind of even validating now the target of dll3 [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1276.9s)]
*  totally and then making us was even more interesting to follow absolutely when we started [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1282.74s)]
*  working on dll3 it was an unvalidated target and one should also say maybe one other thing so dll3 [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1287.94s)]
*  is actually a protein that usually is not on the cell surface so it is not found on healthy cells [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1294.42s)]
*  in these cancer cells the direction or where this protein is found changes and suddenly you [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1300.9s)]
*  have an intracellular protein on the surface now you have a sort of a source code to look for these [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1306.26s)]
*  cells and it is very clean so no other healthy cells have it on their surface the problem with [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1312.74s)]
*  the other three is there is not much there so it's a nice call it black and white situation nothing [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1320.02s)]
*  in healthy cells yes very clean expression but not a not much so for some adcs or other approaches [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1326.98s)]
*  you will not be able to deliver enough potency to kill the tumor you need to go with high potency [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1335.78s)]
*  drugs as key cell engagers or radiotherapy and even for radiotherapy maybe well you might want [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1343.3799999999999s)]
*  to explain alpha radiation versus beta radiation and obviously for me this is an alpha target but [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1349.78s)]
*  maybe ken you can give us some background on alpha versus beta radiation that actually brings us back [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1357.1399999999999s)]
*  to the high school when we learned about physics and the different particles obviously right and [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1363.06s)]
*  they're different in ways of radioactive decay and one of them are the alpha the alpha have a high [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1367.86s)]
*  energy they have a very short range but they are really like almost like a sniper and then you have [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1374.4199999999998s)]
*  the beaters which have not so much energy they travel a bit longer and you have a lot of more [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1380.02s)]
*  crossfire effect and to be honest that the majority of experience we currently have actually is [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1385.54s)]
*  with a tc 177 where's the predominantly a bit of minus a beta emitter and we do have a little bit [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1390.42s)]
*  of experience with with alpha editors i mentioned previously radium 223 radio or so-called sofigo [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1396.8200000000002s)]
*  but of course now we have a lot of hope that in this new generation of reliance therapy we are [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1403.94s)]
*  using alphas which have a very high energy which very focussily deliver the radiation to the cells [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1407.94s)]
*  which express the target and do not affect so much other healthy tissues the second difference is that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1414.18s)]
*  you have double strand breaks for alpha interaction for beta emulation you usually have only single [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1420.74s)]
*  strand breaks which means we hope that there's less recovery less repair post alpha and this [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1426.9s)]
*  is obviously something where we also hope that not only the delivery is more like a very precise [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1432.1000000000001s)]
*  a sniper rate but also that once we hit a certain cell that we also really destroy it and make sure [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1437.22s)]
*  it doesn't recover for us of course an important dimension was to pick the radioisotope that [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1444.82s)]
*  matches to on one side the indications more cell lung cancer dll3 as a target and also the profile [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1450.26s)]
*  of our vector and that's where we started the collaboration with oranumid and oranumid who is [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1456.98s)]
*  a leader in the target alpha therapy field using led212 and led212 for me has few specific i say [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1461.86s)]
*  scientific advantages why why we really would like to work with that crazy isotope so first it has a [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1470.02s)]
*  very short decay half-life that means you have a lot of energy deposition in a very short time [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1475.62s)]
*  frame on the tumor and it has a second aspect which is not yet fully explored in that sense [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1482.9s)]
*  it gives time for the immune cells afterwards to come in and start to do their job in the tumor so [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1488.02s)]
*  the radioactivity is not there anymore has been decaying and then the immune cells can start to [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1493.3799999999999s)]
*  do their job the second thing is like from a safety perspective it has a very clean decay chain [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1497.94s)]
*  in the circulation so if it decays in in the bloodstream there is no radioactive daughter [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1503.78s)]
*  radio nuclides that's how we call it and release that can have damaging aspects to other parts of [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1509.8600000000001s)]
*  the body and also the waste management so especially urine that is is excreted by the patient does not [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1515.54s)]
*  need to be collected and stored for a long time this is just nuances in the whole aspect compared [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1521.8600000000001s)]
*  to other radionuclides why we like the lead two one two and on the other side of course [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1527.22s)]
*  or anomic as a collaboration partner extremely strong team dedicated and strong team and great [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1532.1000000000001s)]
*  complementarity in terms of skills in terms of having endless supply of i would call almost [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1538.42s)]
*  endless or endless supply of lead two one two in that sense having great capabilities of running [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1544.26s)]
*  and pre-clinical work as well as clinical work and supplying the radioactive nuclear a new client [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1550.02s)]
*  for pre-clinical and then clinical work so i see a lot of benefit in the collaboration but also [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1556.5s)]
*  using lead two one two as a main client i will echo what donnie said on on maybe or give a bit [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1561.7s)]
*  more background on orano met so orana med is the daughter company of orano which is the french [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1567.14s)]
*  nuclear power company and they've been obviously working in the field of nuclear power since a [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1574.82s)]
*  very long time and also have an investment arm to invest in the next types of energy [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1581.94s)]
*  and they thought i guess let's see what else can be done with nuclear and that's where they realized [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1588.8200000000002s)]
*  that the medical industry they have an advantage they have invested heavily in orano med and i [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1595.78s)]
*  think you need both you need the deep understanding how to handle radioactivity and not be afraid of [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1603.8600000000001s)]
*  and actually then find out how you do this and that's where all the knowledge of orano [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1612.18s)]
*  meets orano med which is then translating this into a therapeutic advantage and really kudos to [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1617.22s)]
*  my team for finding orano med because this is a private french company it was not that obvious [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1625.62s)]
*  in the beginning and luckily we struck that collaboration with this quasi unlimited supply [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1632.34s)]
*  really dedicated team and deep pockets for those investments because they have invested hundreds [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1638.82s)]
*  of millions in these in the supply chain so that will not be us that will be our partner orano med [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1644.8999999999999s)]
*  that works on the supply chain to solve that and i think there we can really it's great to have a [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1651.1399999999999s)]
*  trusted partner and if you follow the news and there's not only this fantastic production site [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1658.26s)]
*  indiana where they together as fedex try to ship out and serve the whole us but they're also i [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1663.46s)]
*  think building a production site now in europe and france if i'm not mistaken and this will of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1668.5800000000002s)]
*  course also enable you to cover the market from both directions where are you at currently with [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  clinical trials and is small cell lung cancer your key indication so obviously small cell lung cancer [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1680.98s)]
*  will be the first and where we want to go but also the target deal is also found on some [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1688.1s)]
*  neoprenorphine tumors that we will also look at so wherever the allow three is expressed we would [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1695.62s)]
*  like to go after it that will be our first in human trial and we aim to start clinical trials [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1701.86s)]
*  so today we're pre-clinical next year so next year we will start to collect first clinical data [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1709.54s)]
*  on the one side that will be exciting but i also heard you can talking earlier colorectal [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1716.98s)]
*  breast cancer what else did you put out there so there's lung cancer so it's naive to think that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1723.14s)]
*  one one target one drug will be kind of the solution we will have to go after a multitude [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1728.82s)]
*  of targets and that's what we're actually doing so in our pipeline i think we have roughly six [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1735.54s)]
*  targets on the way and we're always thinking again which are those tumors that are radio-sensitive [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1740.74s)]
*  which are those indications where we have the best acceptance of the doctors to go forward that's [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1748.1000000000001s)]
*  why it's great to be working with you can and get that information and where can we generate the [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1754.5800000000002s)]
*  data that then also excites the patients to sign up for this type of therapy and i would say we [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1760.74s)]
*  have a good list of two of targets for tumors and we're also thinking about even the next step [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1767.46s)]
*  because our background is multi-specifix and we can do two binding sites in one dark pin an advantage [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1773.14s)]
*  that will be used going forward for for our pipeline so also thinking about targeting different [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1781.14s)]
*  cell types in the tumor sometimes it may be a stromal target the tumor targets are really opening [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1788.18s)]
*  that space for a next generation approach and very excited to be pushing forward on the clinical [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1794.58s)]
*  trial but then broadening the pipeline a lot of innovation right now is in the target right [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1801.78s)]
*  but you cannot protect the target so technically once you have this closer target a new target [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1808.34s)]
*  pretty much everyone else can follow how i see it but please correct me the beauty of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1814.5s)]
*  of molecular partners is that the dark pin platform as a technology platform is something which is not [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1819.3000000000002s)]
*  so easy to copy and paste whereas for example an antibody more or less everybody can try to [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1825.0600000000002s)]
*  develop an antibody against a certain target first of all the dark pin platform as it did exist in [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1830.9s)]
*  three years ago it was not suitable for radiotherapy because of the kidney and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1836.98s)]
*  uptake and the lower tumor targeting or accumulation so only donnie's team has [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1842.82s)]
*  brought this now to the level of that we can say we have a new platform and this platform with the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1848.98s)]
*  tricks we have obviously secured with via ip and maybe donnie you can speak a bit i mean it's still [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1854.98s)]
*  a lot of work it is far from trivial to make these dark pins so we are in the middle i would say of a [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1862.4199999999998s)]
*  learning curve here all makes sense what you said and it's like it's really like we're in the middle [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1870.9s)]
*  of a learning curve i think dll3 that's the showcase we can do it we've been we've proven now we can do [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1875.7800000000002s)]
*  it we can generate those molecules and dll3 is almost like a bit of a special case in that sense [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1882.26s)]
*  because we pick the target that is like biologically makes a lot of sense but i [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1888.5s)]
*  believe others can go for it as well what we're focusing now in the pipeline of molecules to come [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1892.42s)]
*  is like on one side way more tricky targets to address for other modalities so challenging [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1900.02s)]
*  types in the sense of how you need to bind them to have the desired specificity for the tumor [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1907.1399999999999s)]
*  and other aspects where we believe the dark pin brings in a uniqueness so always focusing on where [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1913.06s)]
*  can we build something that is pretty unique and on the other side as as ken and patrick mentioned [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1918.18s)]
*  it's like the multi-specific space that's basically our home turf where we've been now for the last [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1923.06s)]
*  15 years working on multi-specific therapeutic molecules and now if the learnings was made in [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1929.06s)]
*  the radio ligand space building that platform for diapines now we start to combine these two platforms [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1934.58s)]
*  so doing multi-specific radio ligand therapeutics as patrick mentioned for example you say i pick [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1941.22s)]
*  on one side a tumor target and i integrate into the same molecule a struggle target so i hit two [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1947.78s)]
*  parts of the tumor with the same molecule so there's a lot of permutations and thinking [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1953.46s)]
*  of what is the underlying tumor biology we need to address how can we deliver the radioactivity [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1958.66s)]
*  to a high amount but also very homogeneous to the tumor to have the best possible effect for patients [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1964.98s)]
*  what do you see as the current trends i mean there are many pathways right so the first of all we [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1970.26s)]
*  will see the currently approved therapies hopefully see moving to earlier lines [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1975.3000000000002s)]
*  give an example prostate cancer we started very late in administration castration-assistant prostate [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1980.02s)]
*  cancer we now have a couple of studies in the more sensitive setting there are a couple of [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1984.66s)]
*  i.t's even prior to initial resection of the prostate i think this is one of the trends the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1988.18s)]
*  second trends of course combination therapy i think none of our therapies are curative outside [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1992.98s)]
*  of thyroid to be honest and this is something we are going to work on in the future next thing of [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=1997.46s)]
*  course very important is we try to better understand how to personalize medicine to really [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2002.02s)]
*  treat not all patients the same way and in the fourth one i think this is the most exciting one [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2007.54s)]
*  we want to find new targets new target structures and because we can really image very quickly the [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2012.18s)]
*  target expression we can also image very quickly the way such new therapies work that hopefully [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2017.94s)]
*  we've established together with the industry with partners like you biotech but also established [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2024.66s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies so-called fast track mechanisms to bring these drugs as soon as possible [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2029.46s)]
*  into humans and not do the typical 10-year program killing 98 of 99 programs and but really trying to [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2035.54s)]
*  together jump start this development and hopefully really tackle these big [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2043.94s)]
*  sort of tumors in the future together you were mentioning the clinical trials earlier what's the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2048.5s)]
*  mode of delivery to the patient the dominant way of injections intervenously so very similar let's [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2055.3s)]
*  say to uh to an intravenous chemotherapy the injection itself is somewhere between five to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2061.06s)]
*  20 minutes it's not very long it's it's true that the all the reactivity which is not binding to the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2065.54s)]
*  tumor is predominantly excreted where the kidney and the blood is so it makes a certain sense to [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2070.74s)]
*  collect the urine if possible regarding the pathway and how this is happening it's a little bit [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2076.4199999999996s)]
*  heterogeneous in the europe in the u.s so you have let's say very liberal regulations like for example [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2081.9399999999996s)]
*  in the u.s and also more recently in italy and where patients can be treated in the so-called [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2087.54s)]
*  day hospital and after two or three hours leave immediately or if you go into these radiophobic [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2092.58s)]
*  countries including germany where patients have to stay two nights in the hospital overall i think [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2097.7s)]
*  this is one of the factors people very often underestimate is it's a very well tolerated [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2103.62s)]
*  treatment when you look at the success of the current treatments it's not only because they [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2108.4199999999996s)]
*  perform better than established cure therapies but they also significantly improve quality of [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2113.3799999999997s)]
*  life of patients again one thing is important the whole administration process you don't feel [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2118.8199999999997s)]
*  much about it's not painful you don't lose your hair and the second thing is overall it does not [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2123.86s)]
*  only improve the survival of patients but also significantly improves the quality of life and [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2128.9s)]
*  it is something which i also had to appreciate over the last years talking more and more with [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2135.3s)]
*  patient representatives is yes they want to live longer but even more than living longer as they [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2139.46s)]
*  want to live well and this is still something when you talk about clinical trials we sometimes [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2145.1400000000003s)]
*  underestimate how important quality of life parameters really are for success of such a [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2148.9s)]
*  therapy what's the frequency of treatment how often do they need to take this so this is an [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2154.1s)]
*  excellent question so right now we do have therapies where we perform the treatment every six to eight [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2159.38s)]
*  weeks somewhere between four to six cycles but we also see a certain amount of innovation there [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2165.86s)]
*  there's for example in the prostate space currently a prospective phase three study ongoing [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2170.58s)]
*  that they try to reduce the treatment to only two applications and there's another one very [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2175.14s)]
*  interesting it's a completely different program where they actually treat the patient only once [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2180.5s)]
*  and then they wait until the patient progresses again and they retreated the last one is the hk2 [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2185.8599999999997s)]
*  target and the program is by Janssen and it's going to go into phase three very very innovative [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2191.8599999999997s)]
*  at trial design the other one i mentioned the phase three study prospectively is by telix where [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2196.58s)]
*  they only apply two cycles so that we see a lot of research and work also done on this but right now [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2200.98s)]
*  it's four to six cycles to wrap things up maybe you could give your impressions of where you see [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  the radiopharma field developing we have opened the door for radiotherapy especially in prostate [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2214.1800000000003s)]
*  productive drugs with the darpin platform we have now established a novel therapeutic modality in [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2221.7000000000003s)]
*  that space that opens the door for more targets for more indications and also likely for combinations [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2229.46s)]
*  of targets for that to work we needed to access the the lead or the alpha supply via our aronamet [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2237.2200000000003s)]
*  also that box is ticked and we are very confident that they will work and solve the supply chain [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2243.78s)]
*  questions and for me the vision and that's what actually caught my eye in the beginning of the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2249.62s)]
*  whole field is this idea of you see what you treat with imaging and you treat what you see [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2256.1s)]
*  to ken's point i mean it's the first time where you can actually literally monitor the tumor and [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2262.2599999999998s)]
*  then treat and i think this in today's life when we want to see things understand things this is [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2268.8199999999997s)]
*  really the promise and going to more personalized more drugs and even those combinations that's [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2275.7799999999997s)]
*  why i see this field going so for us it's a as a field it's a very critical phase people are aware [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2283.22s)]
*  of us to some degree now we really need to first of all make sure that the therapies we have [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2289.54s)]
*  available we bring to patients so we really need to handle the scale up the second thing is we [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2293.54s)]
*  really also need to make people aware of us so that's why i'm very grateful for this podcast [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2297.8599999999997s)]
*  giving the opportunity to make people aware what radiotherapy is everyone knows with adc's is [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2302.4199999999996s)]
*  everyone knows with chemotherapies we still don't do this enough the third one the most important is [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2306.98s)]
*  to make this growth sustainable we need to come with new therapies we know we need to go beyond [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2312.02s)]
*  some of the stuff and two receptors psna we really need to tackle other very important solid tumors [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2317.54s)]
*  very other important solid targets and this is something which we can orient it together and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2322.9s)]
*  that's why i'm very grateful that the molecular partners gang invited me to this podcast because [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2327.7s)]
*  we need to work together academia patients and industry so i think this is a very critical moment [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2332.5s)]
*  but if we continue to deliver then we are here to stay [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2339.14s)]
*  really interesting subject and a great conversation there definitely a field to keep an eye on in the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2348.1s)]
*  future don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at the biotech.eu and i hope [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2354.66s)]
*  wherever in the world you are you'll have a great week ahead thanks for listening and i hope you'll [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2362.3399999999997s)]
*  join us next time for another beyond biotech [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMh88s3ISUA&t=2367.86s)]
