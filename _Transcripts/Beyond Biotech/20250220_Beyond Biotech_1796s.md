Video Description: Resalis Therapeutics is pursuing a groundbreaking approach to obesity treatment.

Unlike current therapies that primarily focus on appetite suppression, Resalis’ lead program, RES-010, is a non-coding RNA drug candidate that targets underlying biological pathways to promote sustainable weight loss. 

By enhancing energy expenditure through white-to-brown adipose tissue conversion while preserving muscle mass, RES-010 is positioned as an ideal standalone therapy or a synergistic option for long-term weight management.

The company recently initiated a phase 1 study in December 2024 for RES-010 in healthy and obese subjects, and they also secured an equity investment from @Sanofi  in October 2024.

To talk about ways to tackle obesity, and Resalis’ approach, our guest on the podcast this week is Alessandro Toniolo, CEO of Resalis Therapeutics.

# Can RNA drugs solve the obesity epidemic?
**Beyond Biotech:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 131. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=16.0s)]
*  Whether or not you call it an epidemic, the issue of obesity in the world today is hard [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=20.72s)]
*  to ignore. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  There's a huge amount of interest from the biotech and biopharma industries who are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=27.72s)]
*  looking to develop a variety of solutions. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=33.04s)]
*  Most current treatments revolve around appetite suppression, however there are other ways, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  and one of these has been developed by Rosales Therapeutics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=43.4s)]
*  To tell us about how to treat obesity our guest this week is Alessandro Torniolo, CEO [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=47.42s)]
*  of Rosales Therapeutics. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  So I wonder first before we start talking about obesity and treatments, I wonder if [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=58.2s)]
*  you could first tell me a bit about the company. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=63.28s)]
*  Sure, I joined Rosales two years and a half ago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=65.72s)]
*  It was installed a bit earlier in 2021, but you know the first steps moved from the Harvard [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=69.8s)]
*  Medical School, BIDMC in particular, when our first co-founder Ricardo Panela was a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=77.4s)]
*  postdoc student in the oncology department. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=84.6s)]
*  So interestingly, we are going to talk about obesity, but the journey started in the oncology [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=87.52s)]
*  field. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  At that time they were looking for super-oncogenic microRNAs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  For those who are not familiar with microRNA, it's totally fine because last year the inventors [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=99.92s)]
*  of microRNAs, Ambrose and Rufkun, have been awarded with the Nobel Prize. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=108.44s)]
*  But before it was totally legitimate, not knowing anything about microRNAs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=113.0s)]
*  So microRNAs are small pieces of RNA that are able to link to many messenger RNAs simultaneously. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=119.28s)]
*  So they are compatible with many mRNAs so that they can modulate tens or hundreds of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=128.54s)]
*  messenger simultaneously so entire pathways can be orchestrated and modulated with one [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=137.48s)]
*  single microRNA or non-coding RNA. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=144.44s)]
*  They believe that they're interesting because you can touch many, many genes simultaneously [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=148.72s)]
*  just with one single agent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=155.2s)]
*  And in particular, they were studying MIR22, hoping to have found a super-oncogenic gene [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=157.0s)]
*  to target. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=165.68s)]
*  That was not the case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  And actually they generated mice over-expressing MIR22, genetically modified, and so hoping [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=168.44s)]
*  to see more cancer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=176.34s)]
*  That was not the case. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=178.44s)]
*  These mice were not producing any tumor. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  But it turned out that 100% penetrance, all these mice were obese. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=183.68s)]
*  And so Ricardo, when he noticed this, he was kind of trying to understand. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=190.72s)]
*  And he generated, conversely, he generated genetic mice with MIR22 completely knocked [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=197.08s)]
*  out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=205.8s)]
*  So the opposite, thinking that in this case he should observe very lean mice, which was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=206.8s)]
*  not the case again. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=213.32s)]
*  These knocked out MIR22 mice were indistinguishable from the wild type siblings. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=215.04s)]
*  They were identical in all respects with just one exception. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=221.16s)]
*  When challenged with high fat diets, so a diet which was supposed to induce obesity, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=226.4s)]
*  they were unable to become obese. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=232.82s)]
*  They were unable to gain weight. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  So this was the ha-ha moment, realizing that a single non-coding RNA was able, when over-expressing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=237.28s)]
*  to produce obesity with 100% penetrance, and when suppressed was able to protect from obesity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=245.8s)]
*  So then the journey started. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=254.76s)]
*  Ricardo contacted Professor Sakari Kampinen at the Aarburg University in Copenhagen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=257.44s)]
*  He's a super expert in building inhibitors of microRNAs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=263.32s)]
*  They developed our main asset, which is called RESS-010, and it turned out it's a very effective [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=270.0s)]
*  inhibitor of MIR22. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=279.0s)]
*  As you can imagine, first tests on mice and then superior species, and then we tested [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=281.62s)]
*  on human organoids of various type, or white adipose tissue organoid, liver organoids, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=287.56s)]
*  and so on. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=294.68s)]
*  And now we're cleaning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=295.68s)]
*  So since October passed here, we are testing safety in humans, and we are very happy to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=297.68s)]
*  have seen this accelerating journey. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  I wonder if, before we talk about what you're doing with obesity, if you could outline some [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=306.92s)]
*  of the statistics around what's maybe even an epidemic and the economic costs associated [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  with that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=318.16s)]
*  Yeah, Jim, you're using the right word, epidemic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=319.16s)]
*  How many people are in the world right now? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=323.6s)]
*  Seven or eight billion. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=325.72s)]
*  One billion is obese currently, and the statistics are projecting a terrifying situation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  The last world obesity atlas is projecting obesity to affect one-fourth of the global [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=336.24s)]
*  population in less than 2035, and another quarter of the population to be overweight. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  So think about half of the population is going to be overweight and obese, and right [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=352.84s)]
*  now in the USA, already 40% are obese. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  And we are not talking about aesthetics, of course, so that's not a problem. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  Obesity unfortunately is connected with life-threatening comorbidities. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  So you can imagine type 2 diabetes depend on being overweight and obese. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  Other diseases, including strokes, cancer is linked with obesity, with multiple cancers [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=381.4s)]
*  really correlating with body mass index, liver disease, steatosis, also depression, degeneration [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=387.84s)]
*  of central nervous system depends on obesity. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=395.76s)]
*  So there is massive impact on our survival and the quality of our survival. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  This has a tremendous impact on economics. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  We believe that the economic cost of obesity exceeds two trillion annually. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=409.0s)]
*  It's similar to smoking at this point. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=416.0s)]
*  How this amount of money is calculated, so it's a twofold impact. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=419.0s)]
*  On one hand, it impacts the productivity of the workforce, and on the other hand, increased [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=424.24s)]
*  health care costs. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=431.24s)]
*  All these comorbidities lead to hospitalisation, medication, shortened life expectancy and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=433.24s)]
*  so on. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=440.6s)]
*  So it's an epidemic. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=441.6s)]
*  I see that progressively we see obesity more like a complex disease and less like a behaviour. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=442.6s)]
*  Actually it's a multifactorial disease. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=452.2s)]
*  There is a behaviour, but also there is genetics. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=456.12s)]
*  It has a lot to do with the first years when we grew up and when our system forms adipocytes. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=459.92s)]
*  So the number of adipocytes is linked to how much we ate during our childhood. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=467.6s)]
*  And once it's fixed, you cannot go back. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  So the total number of adipocytes then remains constant over time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=476.84s)]
*  And even when we lose weight, it means that our adipocytes shrink because they lose fat, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=481.8s)]
*  but they remain and they want to get filled again. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=489.16s)]
*  So the behaviour during our childhood is very, very important and determines the behaviour [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=494.12s)]
*  of adults by inducing this trend to refill our adipocytes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  It sounds kind of dramatic, but it's the essential work of our evolution. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=507.88s)]
*  Adipocytes have been selected for their efficiency to store calories into our adipocytes. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=513.88s)]
*  And it's very difficult now to go back and tell our bodies, sorry, our survival is not [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=520.3599999999999s)]
*  linked to how much we are efficient in storing energy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=526.8399999999999s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=530.16s)]
*  We need to become inefficient in storing energy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=531.2399999999999s)]
*  So we need to play against our evolution. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=534.68s)]
*  It's a bit tricky. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Are there many companies currently working on developing new treatments for obesity? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=539.48s)]
*  Yeah, current trend, of course, is based on GLP-1s. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=545.4s)]
*  Everybody knows these very important agents. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=549.6s)]
*  GLP-1s act in particular on insulin secretion, glucagon secretion. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=552.52s)]
*  But for the scope of this discussion, they act directly on weight loss because they induce [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=559.64s)]
*  reduction of appetite and increase the sense of society by slowing down the gastric emptying. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=565.44s)]
*  So they act on appetite. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=574.12s)]
*  GLP-1s induce people to eat less. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=575.96s)]
*  And you know, this sounds fantastic. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=579.48s)]
*  What else would you like to see for an anti-obesity drug? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=581.48s)]
*  Well, I would say good, but not perfect. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=585.8800000000001s)]
*  It's a very good starting point. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=589.96s)]
*  But when you reduce the food intake, you not only act on your excessive fatness, but also [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=592.32s)]
*  on your muscles. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  Approximately one third of the body weight loss is due to muscle loss, which is not good [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=600.36s)]
*  for us. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  And then there is another effect, more threatening, I would say, the body response. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  When you reduce the food intake, it's not that your body keeps on consuming the same [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=614.24s)]
*  basal energy per hour. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=620.64s)]
*  The body response, reducing the amount of energy we are able to disperse as heat. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=623.76s)]
*  So again, this trend follows the reduced food intake. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=631.2s)]
*  And over time, unfortunately, the body adapts to this block of appetite and people tends [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=636.36s)]
*  to start re-eating. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  And therefore, this energy balance, which was positive in the sense that it was inducing [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=644.84s)]
*  weight loss, becomes negative again, because if you restart eating a bit and your energy [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  consumption level is low, then a little bit of re-eating more brings your fat back. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  So this is quite dramatic in the long term. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=663.4s)]
*  And when people stop taking GLP-1s, then they see a rebound because out of the sudden, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=666.32s)]
*  this effect on appetite vanishes and you only have this reduced basal energy consumption. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=672.88s)]
*  And so this balance is very much altered and we see the very well-known rebound effect [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=679.7600000000001s)]
*  when you stop GLP-1. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=685.6s)]
*  So the trend now is adding different components to the appetite. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  So big players are developing other multi-agonists, not only towards GLP-1, but also to GYP, glucagon, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=693.36s)]
*  amylin. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=703.24s)]
*  All these different ingredients are supposed to play also in the direction of rebalance, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=704.24s)]
*  the energy expenditure and thermogenesis, you know, to act on different directions, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=711.48s)]
*  complementing the reduced appetite effect. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=717.84s)]
*  Of course, the more you add in terms of different hormones, targeting different hormones, the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=720.72s)]
*  more difficulties to balance all these hormones playing together like a complex orchestra [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=727.1600000000001s)]
*  and a little bit more gastrointestinal effect we see. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  But the direction is correct. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  We need to complement the effect on appetite with energy, addressing energy, addressing [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=742.84s)]
*  fat metabolism. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=749.68s)]
*  And this is the direction we are pursuing. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=751.4s)]
*  But I would like to mention another few biotechs. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  I think they're working in this direction and, you know, reinforcing the idea that energy, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  mitochondria, fat storage are other effects to really to consider. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=765.12s)]
*  Rebus Pharmaceuticals, OrsoBio, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, they are working in addressing [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  these elements. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=777.9599999999999s)]
*  And coming back to Rosales, I have to say that addressing this microRNA, the number [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=779.5999999999999s)]
*  22, this is able to affect all these three components, complementary to appetite, all [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=785.4799999999999s)]
*  simultaneously. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=792.76s)]
*  So lipid storage, energy expenditure and activation of our fat. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  While you were mentioning that, I was wondering about calorific intake. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=800.88s)]
*  If we reduce the amount of food that we eat through an appetite suppressant, does that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=804.84s)]
*  also affect the quality of our diet insofar as we reduce the calorific intake? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=812.32s)]
*  But if we reduce it so much that we aren't taking in the right kind of nutrition, does [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=819.52s)]
*  that have a negative effect? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=827.88s)]
*  On one hand, it's very good because it suppresses the desire for alcohol as well, which is what [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=828.88s)]
*  is not very healthy food for us. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=835.76s)]
*  I would say, fortunately, over time, our body dictates what it needs. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=837.76s)]
*  So over time, and we see clearly in animals that, you know, animals treated with GLP-1 [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=843.8s)]
*  after a few weeks slash few months start re-eating because the body demands, our adipocytes demands [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=850.68s)]
*  to be refilled. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=859.16s)]
*  And as I was mentioning at the beginning, just blocking appetite cannot be a long-term [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=861.36s)]
*  solution. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=866.88s)]
*  Let me rephrase in a different way. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=868.32s)]
*  Complex diseases such as obesity are, by definition, multi-pathway, multi-tissue, multi-organ diseases. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=871.32s)]
*  Different organs are involved. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=880.72s)]
*  We cannot fix it by touching just one single gene. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=882.96s)]
*  Either it's not producing clinically meaningful results or clinically meaningful results that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=887.48s)]
*  last for a long time because the body will find a way to skip that single gene. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=895.0799999999999s)]
*  And we see that, you know, you block appetite and the body sooner or later will find a way [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=900.36s)]
*  to tell the brain, we need food, we need more energy intake because we need to survive. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=905.36s)]
*  With resotel, with blocking miR22, we gently modulate tens of genes simultaneously. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=912.52s)]
*  And we believe that with this approach, it's much more difficult to develop resistance [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=920.92s)]
*  to this drug so that we can produce disease-modifying long-term results that stay over time. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  Because it's an epidemic almost, do you think that there will be lots of new treatments [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=934.76s)]
*  introduced? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=938.8s)]
*  And when do you think that might be? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  So consider this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=944.3599999999999s)]
*  Jeffries, investment bank, very known investment bank, projects the market of obesity higher [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=946.4799999999999s)]
*  than 125 billion in peak sales, roughly in 10 years, less than 10 years. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=954.04s)]
*  You can imagine the appetite in this case, sorry for using this, the appetite for researchers [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=960.92s)]
*  and biotech companies to be part of this exciting opportunity. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=968.44s)]
*  The main pathway of the research goes in the direction of multi-incretine agonist, GMP1, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=974.48s)]
*  GIP, glucagon, amylin and so on. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=982.0s)]
*  But there are others working directly on mitochondria, energy expenditure and other directions. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=986.04s)]
*  I think that you will see many dual, triple agonists in this decade, in the next five [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=992.92s)]
*  years. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1000.48s)]
*  We know that Novo and Lili, who are the two main current players, will launch a new generation [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1001.68s)]
*  in creatine agonists. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1010.24s)]
*  But other players will be in this game. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1011.92s)]
*  I can name Roche, Amgen, Zeeland, Boeringer Heim, Viking, Altimune. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1015.12s)]
*  So there are many big players, fighters, working in this area. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1023.6s)]
*  And well, we should wonder if there is space for all this in creatine agonists. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1029.4s)]
*  So it's going to be very interesting. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1035.08s)]
*  All GLP-1 agents, I think, will be launched at the end of this decade, beginning of next [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1038.28s)]
*  decade, complementing GLP-1. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1044.68s)]
*  I don't think that other agents can replace GLP-1s from being back-born of anti-obesity. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1047.28s)]
*  But definitely GLP-1s cannot play entirely the role providing quality weight loss, durable [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1056.04s)]
*  weight loss and long-term results alone, at least. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1065.0s)]
*  Most companies seem to be taking that approach of appetite suppression. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1070.12s)]
*  I wonder if you could talk us through the approach that you're taking and why it's a [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1073.6s)]
*  little different to that. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1078.28s)]
*  It's very tricky that our body responds to reduced food intake by reducing the energy [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1080.4399999999998s)]
*  expenditure. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1087.0s)]
*  So counterbalancing our effort in reducing food intake. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1088.0s)]
*  We have a different approach. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1093.68s)]
*  We try to increase energy expenditure without affecting food intake at all. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1095.5600000000002s)]
*  We believe that this approach will provide longer-term, durable results. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1101.16s)]
*  And in particular, since we address fat metabolism, we do not affect at all muscles. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  We only target fat metabolism. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  So Reso10 is a good inhibitor of MiR22, and MiR22 orchestrates at least three pathways [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1118.56s)]
*  simultaneously. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1127.3999999999999s)]
*  One is the lipid biosynthesis, so that by blocking MiR22, we reduce the ability of our [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1129.44s)]
*  body to store fat, which is good if you want to lose weight. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1136.6s)]
*  The second effect is that by blocking MiR22, we induce brownization of the white adipose [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1141.88s)]
*  tissue. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1148.8000000000002s)]
*  White adipose tissue is the fat used to store energy. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1149.8000000000002s)]
*  Brown adipose tissue is the fat we have to activate to use this amount of energy we have [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1154.44s)]
*  stored. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1161.3200000000002s)]
*  So if our agent activates, turns the storing fat into active fat, this is a step instrumental [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1162.76s)]
*  for getting rid of this excessive amount of fat. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1172.04s)]
*  The third pathway we act upon is the biogenesis and function of mitochondria, which is the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1175.76s)]
*  final and essential step. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1182.36s)]
*  Mitochondria are those organelles within the cells used to burn fat. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1185.1599999999999s)]
*  Look at the entire picture. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1191.76s)]
*  We reduce our ability to store lipids, and we activate the current excessive amount of [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1193.24s)]
*  lipids we have in burning into new and functional mitochondria. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1201.12s)]
*  All this stored together produces an enhanced fat metabolism at cellular level. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1207.6s)]
*  We address only the excessive amount of fat. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1217.24s)]
*  It's very interesting to see that the animals we treat, if they're not obese, like the treatment [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1221.44s)]
*  has no effect whatsoever. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1228.5600000000002s)]
*  They don't lose unnecessary weight because they don't have any extra fat to lose. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1231.2s)]
*  But in obese mice and monkeys, we see that they lose the excessive amount of fat, I would [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1236.88s)]
*  say the pathological amount of fat, until they come back to a normal weight range or [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1243.36s)]
*  overweight. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1250.56s)]
*  They lie between normal and overweight. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1251.52s)]
*  And, you know, the approach is self-regulating. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1254.6399999999999s)]
*  So if animals get rid of the excessive amount of fat, the drugs basically stops working. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1258.96s)]
*  We see this effect even when we stop the treatment. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1266.8s)]
*  When we stop the treatment, the genes are so many genes are re-expressed, re-modulated [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1270.24s)]
*  in a healthy way that it takes time for our genes to come back to the original expression. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1277.28s)]
*  So we remain in a high energy expenditure mode for months before the effect goes away. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1284.24s)]
*  How does your drug work exactly on a cellular level, I guess? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1293.76s)]
*  MIIR22 modulates multiple genes, all involved in the lipid storage and mitochondria [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1298.0s)]
*  biogeneration and functions. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1305.12s)]
*  I have also to say that it takes time for our drug to show that it's producing clinical [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1307.76s)]
*  meaningful results. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1314.72s)]
*  In the first two weeks, we apparently we don't see results, but we see gene activation. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1315.84s)]
*  So there is a sequence or a cascade of events. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1322.16s)]
*  First, we block MIIR22. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1325.92s)]
*  The inhibition of MIIR22 remodulates multiple genes. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  We can track and follow all these genes moving. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  And these genes then change the cellular metabolism. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1336.88s)]
*  The production of new mitochondria is just one of the effects. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1341.04s)]
*  So once the mitochondria are in place, then we activate fat and we start burning the excessive [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1347.04s)]
*  amount of fat. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1353.68s)]
*  So the whole process takes a few weeks. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1354.64s)]
*  How is it administered and is it something that people need to take for life or [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1359.0400000000002s)]
*  just until they lose weight? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1364.24s)]
*  Well, we don't change the DNA of people. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1366.48s)]
*  So we never tested beyond a six month treatment. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1369.8400000000001s)]
*  It's administered subcutaneously and we are testing at the moment a weekly injection. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1374.8000000000002s)]
*  So at the moment we are testing weekly, but once the cellular metabolism is reprogrammed, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1381.0400000000002s)]
*  we believe, and this is our aim to demonstrate that we are able to reduce the frequency of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1388.88s)]
*  administration until very infrequent administration to re-challenge the gene activation [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1394.48s)]
*  and to keep the energy expenditure higher than normal. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1402.4s)]
*  Whether we need to hammer our cellular forever at weekly administration or we can reduce [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1407.44s)]
*  dosage, that's a very interesting question and it's a matter for our next studies. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1414.72s)]
*  But the aim is to reduce frequency. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1421.2s)]
*  You asked, do we have to stay on treatment forever? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1424.72s)]
*  Maybe, but maybe at the level that you don't perceive you are on treatment forever, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1429.28s)]
*  that your frequency of administration is reduced so much that possibly you don't perceive [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1436.16s)]
*  the cage of the treatment. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1442.72s)]
*  So where are you at on the clinical trial path right now? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1444.72s)]
*  We're in phase one and so we are testing safety by definition. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1449.28s)]
*  We started treating normal weight, young, healthy volunteers and over time we will shift [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1454.64s)]
*  in two directions, increasing the dosage and shifting towards more overweight and obese [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1463.36s)]
*  population to test pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics into the target population. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1470.08s)]
*  In about one year, one year and a half, we should have the safety results and we will be able to [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1476.8s)]
*  jump directly into phase two, efficacy proof of concept. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  That will be a very, very important moment for Rizalis because, you know, after having [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1486.7199999999998s)]
*  demonstrated efficacy in mice, in non-human primates, in human organoids, it will be time [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1492.16s)]
*  to test in real humans, in real patients. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1498.72s)]
*  So if we replicate the results we have seen in animals, we are going to have a transformative [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1501.92s)]
*  approach for humans. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1507.76s)]
*  Excellent news. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1509.68s)]
*  Is there anything else in the pipeline? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1511.28s)]
*  Yes, we have accumulated in the past years a lot of knowledge about Blockin-Mir 22 and we [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1513.8400000000001s)]
*  discovered that Blockin-Mir 22 has multiple benefits for our body and now we are developing [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1519.92s)]
*  new agents targeting different organs. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1528.72s)]
*  So our living acids, it's administered subcutaneously, it goes into our blood, it goes [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1532.4s)]
*  into the liver and the liver redistributed systemically into the whole body. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1540.24s)]
*  But if you want to target a specific organ, liver or other organs, for instance, you may [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1545.76s)]
*  want to change the chemistry a little bit of this agent to direct your agent preferentially [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1552.0s)]
*  in one organ or the others. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1558.64s)]
*  So we are thinking about muscles or liver or white adipose tissue in particular to address [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1560.4s)]
*  different diseases. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1566.72s)]
*  So now details are undisclosed at this moment, but I think you can appreciate that Mir 22 [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1568.16s)]
*  is linked. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1574.4s)]
*  It has to do with the evolution and so we believe that what was useful for our bodies [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1575.44s)]
*  in a scarcity of food becomes dangerous when there is too much food and dangerous in multiple [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1582.24s)]
*  directions in many different elements and organs, not only for obesity but also for [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1589.8400000000001s)]
*  other potential diseases. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1595.92s)]
*  What do you see as the future for the company and what are the next steps? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1598.48s)]
*  Well, the next step will be safety. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's the foundation of any good drug and then immediately after efficacy, efficacy [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1606.56s)]
*  in obesity, but also in some comorbidities. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1614.72s)]
*  We learned from the GLP-1s, GLP-1s have demonstrated efficacy in diabetes at the beginning, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1619.6s)]
*  then they demonstrated efficacy in weight loss and then they learned that in using weight [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1625.84s)]
*  loss has multiple benefits on kidneys function, on heart function, on CNS and others. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1633.36s)]
*  We have elements to say that in vision Mir 22 has benefits not only indirectly to other [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1642.08s)]
*  organs by reducing body weight but directly on other organs. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1651.6s)]
*  So we would like to demonstrate also the benefit, the direct benefit in other organs because [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1657.28s)]
*  we believe we're going to have a chronic disease, whether frequent or hopefully infrequent, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1662.6399999999999s)]
*  but it's going to be a chronic treatment. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1668.08s)]
*  If we demonstrate that we preserve the health of other organs, this will be definitely an [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1671.12s)]
*  added value over time. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1678.8s)]
*  And I guess it's not just organs as well, because if you're overweight, then it puts [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1680.6399999999999s)]
*  pressure on the skeleton, your knees, your ankles. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1686.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1689.9199999999998s)]
*  But I give an example, you mentioned bones. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1691.12s)]
*  One thing is that you provide benefit to the bones by reducing the body weight. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1694.48s)]
*  That's obvious. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1701.4399999999998s)]
*  What if you provide benefit to the bones, increasing the mineral density? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1702.72s)]
*  And that will be a direct benefit on bones. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1709.1200000000001s)]
*  So we are exploring this kind of direct benefit. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1712.4s)]
*  All right, great. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1716.0s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1716.64s)]
*  Is there anything else that you wanted to mention? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1717.2800000000002s)]
*  I wanted to remark that it's an exciting, very exciting time where multiple different [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1720.4s)]
*  approaches to obesity are progressing. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1726.48s)]
*  And it's very difficult to understand how will be the obesity landscape in 10 years. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1729.92s)]
*  So it's an ideal moment for biotech companies to play their games and to bet on their solutions. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1736.56s)]
*  One thing's for sure, the issues surrounding obesity aren't going to go away. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1750.72s)]
*  And this is a massive topic for biotech and biopharma to take on and help alleviate. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1756.32s)]
*  Clearly, there are going to be options, which is a good thing. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1762.96s)]
*  Don't forget to check out all the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1766.56s)]
*  And I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1772.96s)]
*  Thanks for listening. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjQyzAg6OI&t=1776.96s)]
