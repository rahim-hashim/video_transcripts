# Looking at 2025 biotech trends with SoftBank Vision Fund
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 124. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=17.6s)]
*  This week we're talking about capital. Softbank Vision Fund is one of the largest venture [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=20.68s)]
*  funds in the world with more than $160 billion assets under management and a portfolio of more [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=26.8s)]
*  than 250 companies. So definitely a good company to be talking to about macro investment trends [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=34.72s)]
*  within life sciences, the European health and biotech scene, as well as the precise applications [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=42.4s)]
*  of new and emerging AI technologies. Our guest this week is John Cassidy. Hi John, thanks for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=49.2s)]
*  joining us today. Nice to speak to you today. John Cassidy, I'm head of life sciences at the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=56.24s)]
*  Softbank Vision Fund. Vision Fund is two large growth equity venture capital funds focused on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=62.24s)]
*  tech, $100 billion AUM in the first fund, $60 billion in the second fund. We're focused on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=70.72s)]
*  investing in high innovation, high growth, private technology companies. My team are specifically [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=77.28s)]
*  focused on investing in companies innovating at the intersection between technology and human [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=84.0s)]
*  health. And so we cover everything from therapeutics and biotech through to tools, diagnostics, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=90.0s)]
*  digital health and some high tech, med tech as well. Softbank at the corporate level at the Top Co [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=97.68s)]
*  has long held a view that we should be thinking about decades, if not longer, into the future and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=105.84s)]
*  the impact that technologies we support can have. It's a reflection of that vision behind our [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=112.72s)]
*  investments and how we want to change, in my case, human health care for the better. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=117.92s)]
*  A pity that politics didn't have a vision beyond three or four years because I think that's something [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=123.6s)]
*  that we need to evolve beyond as well. I think timeline and alignment and incentives to deliver, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=128.96s)]
*  against a timeline are extremely important. And I think you see that typically with private [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=138.0s)]
*  focused funds being kind of 10, 12 year funds, we're actually quite lucky that Vision Fund too, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=144.24s)]
*  we're effectively an evergreen fund. So it's investing Softbank Group, balance sheet cash. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=150.72s)]
*  And so in theory, quite patient capital, because we don't have a fund life cycle to deliver back [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=156.4s)]
*  again. So can think a little bit longer term about the impact that our investments are making. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=162.08s)]
*  You do have quite a lot of companies in the portfolio. How do you manage so many, both from [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  your company perspective and also from those in your own personal portfolio? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we do have a large portfolio at the Vision Fund. We are divided into, I guess, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=180.08s)]
*  focus teams. I lead the life sciences team. I have a life sciences background, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  PhD originally, and then a strategy consultant and then a life sciences investor at another fund [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=190.32s)]
*  before moving over. I think we manage our portfolio quite actively. So our team spread over the US and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=196.64s)]
*  Europe is able to look after the breadth of companies that we're working on, partly because [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=205.04s)]
*  we have such depth in our sector that we're able to get up to speed quicker and support those [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=210.16s)]
*  companies, I guess, through our ecosystem and network. Anyway, there's a lot of overlap, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=215.84s)]
*  actually, in what a lot of our companies are doing, or at least complementarity. It is a lot of work. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to say that it's not, but I think it's quite manageable when you have a very focused, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=226.56s)]
*  specialized team who are living and breathing this space day in, day out. We can spend more [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=232.24s)]
*  of our time actually looking for good deals, helping the companies that we've already invested [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=238.0s)]
*  in, rather than just learning about a new space. We're already fluent in the underlying content, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=242.72s)]
*  and then it's just looking for those unique situations which we think are attractive enough [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=248.72s)]
*  and can form a view relatively quickly. So though our headcount to AUM assets under management [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=254.0s)]
*  is pretty lean, I guess it forces you to be very efficient. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=262.64s)]
*  Could you tell us a bit about some of the companies that you're working with? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=266.96s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I'd love to talk about a couple that we've invested this year and then a few [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=270.4s)]
*  that have been in our portfolio a little longer. The most recent deal that we announced, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  we've actually already invested in Two Rounds Four, which is a company called Metzera, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=279.28s)]
*  which is a New York-based biotech that is working on novel therapeutics for weight loss and metabolic [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  disease. This is a company that we had known various parts of the organization for quite a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=290.64s)]
*  while. They had acquired some assets from a spin out of Imperial College London that we had known [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=296.8s)]
*  before, and also some of the founders were known to our team through prior roles. This is an example [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  of a very, I guess, a very high caliber team and leadership team who we knew could execute really [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=308.64s)]
*  well with assets at the exact right stage of development, going into the clinic in an area we [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=315.52s)]
*  know is very hot and has the potential to create a lot of value, weight loss, and having all of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=321.76s)]
*  right ingredients of being in the right place in the right time. So they raised their Series A this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=329.28s)]
*  year, but also their Series B a couple of weeks ago, which we supported as well and seem to be on [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=334.32s)]
*  a very good trajectory. I think the underlying thing there is, you know, we really believe in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=339.68s)]
*  the differentiation of their assets even as the field gets more crowded. There is room for [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=344.08s)]
*  differentiation and we're seeing that already in their clinical data, so we're pretty happy [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=350.64s)]
*  with how that company's going. Another one that we announced earlier in the year, SoftBank made a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=355.36s)]
*  significant investment in a company called Tempus AI, which has since gone public and is a publicly [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=360.8s)]
*  traded company. We're not on the board there, but still remain close to them. And that's a company [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=367.2s)]
*  that's using next generation sequencing as the sort of base assay to support cancer patients [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  and to unlock insights into their cancers and what that might mean for their treatment and their [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=380.96s)]
*  prognosis, but then going further than just providing that as raw data and actually collecting [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  that data, combining it with all of the other clinical data that those patients have, you know, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=394.4s)]
*  in their electronic health records, their imaging data, radiology, their pathology data, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=399.04s)]
*  everything, and cleaning that up and producing really high quality patient data records. And [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=405.36s)]
*  then those can be used for research and to support better insights into how those patients may be [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  managed and how they may progress. There's a couple of different interesting things in there [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=417.6s)]
*  because one, you're providing a better service back to the physician and enabling them to look [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=422.8s)]
*  after their patients in a more informed way. And two, you're generating a dataset that unlocks [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=427.68s)]
*  the training of AI, ML models and algorithms that can see things that individual physicians [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=433.92s)]
*  would struggle to see and it's real world data as well. So it's not collected under the artificial [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=440.64s)]
*  constraints of a clinical trial. And then finally, because you have this curated dataset, you can [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=446.48s)]
*  sell that to pharmaceutical companies who are looking for really interesting and deep, rich [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=453.2s)]
*  clinical datasets to do either finding novel targets and drug discovery or for understanding [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=459.84s)]
*  how to develop existing drugs, what they might look like in a clinical trial. You can effectively [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  run a kind of virtual arm of a study to help inform how you design that study and design the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=472.88s)]
*  statistics for it. So we think it's a really interesting moment. You couldn't have done this [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=479.36s)]
*  10 years ago. I think it would have been very, very expensive to generate that data. There [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=484.0s)]
*  wouldn't have been enough of it for you to do anything really, really useful with in terms of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=489.2s)]
*  training models and algorithms, but we've now got to the point where they're at scale. And we have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=494.16s)]
*  the combination of all of these other types of data and knowing how to handle them and how to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  integrate it all into one model that's actually quite powerful. And so we like to see these [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=504.32s)]
*  situations where scale gives you an advantage and these things are at that point where further [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=510.24s)]
*  investment will really unlock a lot more insights, a lot more value from those datasets. There's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=516.4s)]
*  another one that we invested in in the summer. We're also quite interested in the application of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=521.92s)]
*  AIML on the actual discovery side of things. And so quite a few of our companies in our portfolio [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=528.24s)]
*  have some kind of computational platform for either discovering new targets to go after with [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=535.52s)]
*  therapeutics or making better molecules, making better drugs, either by learning from other drugs [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=541.92s)]
*  that already exist or breaking down some element of drug discovery into a process that is amenable [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=548.72s)]
*  to AIML. So for example, one of the companies we're invested in is called Ventus Therapeutics [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=555.44s)]
*  and has a combination of a biophysical model of molecular dynamics plus solvation water [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=561.6s)]
*  interacting with targets and so able to take a protein structure and apply AIML methods to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=568.72s)]
*  virtually discover chemicals that will bind to that target. And so much better hit rate, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=577.2s)]
*  much better molecules that you're generating and also more diverse chemistry. So exploring [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=582.88s)]
*  a wider range of potential drugs and therefore less likelihood of falling down on a specific [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=589.04s)]
*  idiosyncratic issue like a particular scaffold, a chemical backbone being toxic. If you have a [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  diverse range of starting points, you have kind of other options that you can go with. And so that's [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  a company that's now done that at the discovery stage and taken drugs actually into the clinic [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=610.08s)]
*  for immunology and neurology diseases. And I think that progress comes at a pretty interesting time [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  for the field where people are watching and waiting to see how AIML enabled biotechs are [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=624.08s)]
*  going to fare. And actually the reality is that these tools haven't been used systematically for [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=630.0s)]
*  long enough to get any kind of real statistics on how these programs will do relative to kind [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=636.0s)]
*  of traditional programs. But I think what we do see is some of these early programs kind of going [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=641.68s)]
*  into phase one, going into phase two and having very positive momentum and progress and seeing [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=647.04s)]
*  that they perform very well compared to other therapeutic programs. And so I think as an investor, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=652.32s)]
*  we are quite excited about that second and third generation of AIML enabled drug discovery and drug [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=658.32s)]
*  development companies and how they're going to be able to systematize or I guess make better [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=664.8s)]
*  repeatable improvements to the way that we develop and find these drugs. At the very beginning of the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=673.04s)]
*  process, what criteria do you tend to use when deciding upon investment into companies? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=680.56s)]
*  We're typically a later stage investor in the sense that we wouldn't do company [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=688.24s)]
*  formation ourselves or see series A typically unless they're kind of really taking existing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=693.84s)]
*  platforms and programs from somewhere else and just putting it into a new entity which is [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=700.48s)]
*  actually more mature than the round suggests. We're typically coming in series B, series C and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  onwards. Our investment ticket size is 25 to 75 million dollars for most new investments across [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=709.12s)]
*  those different categories that we cover. And on the therapeutic side, we're really looking for [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=716.88s)]
*  the combination of a platform that we believe has a differentiation and the ability to generate [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=722.24s)]
*  multiple programs that are interesting and that platform is generally technology enabled, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=729.6s)]
*  which often means computational in some level or at least driven by interesting data sets [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=735.52s)]
*  generated at scale. And then the assets themselves, the drugs themselves need to be approaching the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=741.52s)]
*  clinic and certainly would expect our investment to fund the clinical trials that will show whether [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=747.84s)]
*  one or more of those drugs are really competitive. So we're looking at generating that phase one B, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=756.4s)]
*  phase two data depending on what the disease is and what the drug modality is, but looking for [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  things like biomarkers that are predictive of translational value or clinical efficacy in the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=768.96s)]
*  number of patients. So that means we're normally coming into companies that are less than 12 months [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=776.16s)]
*  to IND clearing the regulatory hurdle to get into patients or humans. On the other side of the fence, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  so on the tools, diagnostics, high tech, med tech, digital health, on those investments, we're [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=788.8s)]
*  typically looking for them to already be commercial stage and seeking growth capital. So normally they [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=795.04s)]
*  have call it $10 million of revenue plus and looking to grow that. So I've found some level [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=801.04s)]
*  of product market fit and then looking for investors who can help take them say from $10 million to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=807.52s)]
*  $100 million of revenue. I guess over the last couple of years we've heard about biotech companies [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  and some biopharma companies having issues with funding. I just wondered how you see that and if [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  there are any trends and whether it's getting better? Yeah, the last couple of years have been [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=828.08s)]
*  tough, not just for life sciences. I think it's all high innovation sectors and indeed most sectors [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  globally. I think biotech is particularly sensitive given the cash flows are long dated, so very far [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=838.96s)]
*  into the future and so things like interest rates going up has a disproportionate impact on the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=846.64s)]
*  valuation of those companies and as that impacts the public markets that tends to feed through [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  pretty quickly to how people feel about private companies in the sector and the confidence of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=858.08s)]
*  an IPO being an option down the line but also what valuation you're going to be able to continue to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  finance these inherently cash burning companies. While there's been a challenging period, we've [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=868.88s)]
*  been fortunate that most of our portfolio was sufficiently capitalized to get through [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=875.36s)]
*  kind of 2022-23 without needing to raise capital under distressed circumstances. I think 2024 has [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=880.08s)]
*  been an interesting year because a lot of companies have, you know, they typically raise three years [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=886.24s)]
*  runway back in 21 and so have come up for this year and it's been interesting to see what this [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=891.12s)]
*  market has been like today. I think you kind of break them down into three categories. There's [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=897.36s)]
*  the companies that are doing so well that they can raise and they can raise at a valuation that's [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=901.76s)]
*  reasonable and looks good and we're happy with and you know investors in general, you know, on those [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=905.92s)]
*  cap tables will be pleased with. You've got the companies that are performing reasonably well [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=911.04s)]
*  against their plan but the particular sub-sector that they're in, you know, whether it's selling [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=915.12s)]
*  gene therapy or you know other areas that have been maybe hit harder, they probably do need to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=920.16s)]
*  reset sometimes, you know, their valuation expectations to ensure that they get funded [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=925.84s)]
*  but they'll still get funded and then there are those who struggle to get funded because [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=930.48s)]
*  maybe the idea of itself and the program, the drug, the platform, you know, the risk reward is now [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=935.52s)]
*  you know skewed slightly on the wrong side in the new environment and those are the more difficult [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=942.24s)]
*  situations and I think what we've seen over the last couple of years is, you know, quite a few [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=946.88s)]
*  things fell into that bucket and have either merged with other things or wrapped up while the [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=950.8s)]
*  other two buckets have been kind of fine or thriving. I think going into 2025 is very hard [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=955.92s)]
*  to call. I would have said the last couple of months prior to the last couple of weeks, the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=962.24s)]
*  last couple of months were looking better and better. A few IPOs getting out, a few situations [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=968.08s)]
*  which I think gave people reasons to believe some Bolton M&A above a billion dollar kind of exits. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=973.76s)]
*  I think the election volatility has been a bit confusing to know exactly what it means and I [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=980.72s)]
*  would say everything is relative compared to two years ago. We feel much better compared to maybe [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=986.48s)]
*  a month ago. We feel worse compared to a year ago. We're about the same. It's interesting to [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=992.72s)]
*  see how it changes quite quickly. I think our view being, you know, as I said at the beginning, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=997.84s)]
*  you know, a longer term investor is that actually today represents a really nice opportunity to [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1002.48s)]
*  invest in high quality innovation, a valuation that's much more reasonable compared to 2020 and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1009.36s)]
*  2021 and I think if your time horizon is 10 years plus, you know, the month to month volatility is [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1014.32s)]
*  less important than the sort of creation of value over a five to 10 year period. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1020.8s)]
*  You mentioned the election. I wonder, did that affect anything because it seemed like in some [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1026.48s)]
*  ways there were maybe mixed messages because it's very, or seems as if it's something that will be [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1031.68s)]
*  very pro big business but then on the other hand you're seeing quotes about controlling [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  big pharma. So has that sent mixed messages out or is it too early to say? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1043.84s)]
*  It is difficult. I think the one thing that nobody likes is uncertainty and there was [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1049.92s)]
*  uncertainty in the run up to the election. You know, it was perceived to be very, very close, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1056.16s)]
*  too close to call and the risk there is obviously that you get to a grey result where there's not [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  universal kind of acceptance of that result. I think the fact that we had a very clear result [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  that did lead to a little bump on the public side in biotech, you know, when Trump got in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1072.4s)]
*  and I think it's equally about there being certainty of result as it is anything else. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1078.0800000000002s)]
*  I think the stuff that comes afterwards, you know, as you get more and more information about [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1082.88s)]
*  cabinet and policy, you know, that's where the uncertainty is now. You know, I think you saw [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1087.2s)]
*  that when RFK got announced and the impact on biotech stocks was pretty clear, negative [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1091.76s)]
*  and immediate. And I think a lot of that is uncertainty again. People don't know exactly [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1097.76s)]
*  how people are going to operate, what they think is within their remit, what they're actually able [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1102.16s)]
*  to do over what timeframe that might happen, whether there will be, you know, confirmation [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1106.8799999999999s)]
*  through the Senate. All of those kinds of questions are kind of open questions and that uncertainty, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1112.0s)]
*  you know, hangs, I think, I think it is a bit too early to say. Next year, putting that to one side, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1116.48s)]
*  we have a lot of ingredients that are positive for growth. And so my hope is that we get some [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1122.96s)]
*  clarity on these things and they're almost never, you know, maybe I'll regret saying that, but [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1128.8s)]
*  things are almost never as bad as you imagine the worst case scenario could be. And they're almost [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1133.2s)]
*  never as good as you imagine the best scenario could be. So, you know, we're likely to have a [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1137.68s)]
*  lot of compromises somewhere in the middle on some of these things. And if that's the case, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1142.24s)]
*  then I think we're actually probably on a reasonable track. Earlier, you mentioned about those three [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1146.4s)]
*  kinds of companies in terms of financing. What can companies do? Obviously, if you're in that [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1151.6s)]
*  top bucket, then you're fine. But what can companies do to move from, say, two to one or three to two? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1157.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think the key drivers of what puts something on the right side of the risk reward is [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  how much capital you need to get to a value creating readout. How thrifty are you? How [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1172.0s)]
*  cheaply can you deliver data? How quickly can you deliver that data? And how concrete is that data? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1179.04s)]
*  You can't obviously control, you know, that you're always going to have good data, but you can [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  control whether the data will be equivocal or not. So making sure that things are designed in a way [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1191.6s)]
*  that you answer the question you set out to and you deliver the data as quickly as possible for [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1197.92s)]
*  as little money as possible. We are in a sector where people do take risk for a living, investing [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1202.96s)]
*  in biotech is inherently risky. People know that over 95% of things that make it to IND will never [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1208.8s)]
*  be approved. I mean, much closer to 99% of things. And so we're inherently willing to take that risk, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1215.84s)]
*  but only if it's very clearly a kind of taking the risk on the specific drug in that disease and not [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  that you're going to mis-execute and not that you're going to run over budget and run out of money [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  and, you know, all of these other things. So I think the things that people can control are [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1233.12s)]
*  delivering readouts quickly and very cleanly. I think there are some things that you just can't [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1237.2s)]
*  control. You know, you have to commit to your program with high conviction, despite the fact [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1243.04s)]
*  that external interest in that disease area or that modality may come and go. That's why it's [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1248.72s)]
*  quite important that the investors you select in your early investment rounds are aligned and have [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1255.2s)]
*  that deep conviction that what you're working on is actually high value, even if the market changes [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1261.52s)]
*  its mind on what diseases are hot tomorrow. Ultimately, if you're curing patients or giving [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1266.48s)]
*  patients massive increase in quality of life or life expectancy, that is value being created. And [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1273.68s)]
*  whether you get credit for that value today or tomorrow is a question mark on how much value [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1279.76s)]
*  you get, but there is value. What you can't do is focus on things which are hot, but maybe of [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1283.68s)]
*  incremental value. Really minor improvements to existing therapeutics, you know, in a hot market. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1289.76s)]
*  Where everything's rising, you can probably get paid to do that. But when it's a tough [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1296.48s)]
*  financing environment like now, those kinds of things are the first ones that get hit. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1300.88s)]
*  Are there specific sectors or disease areas that are attracting more interest right now? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1305.44s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, the pendulum swings frequently. I would say some of the things that are [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1311.44s)]
*  very interesting to a lot of people. I mean, weight loss and metabolism is an obvious one. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1318.08s)]
*  It's just become a huge category overnight. It's obviously a challenging one as well, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1323.12s)]
*  because there are a couple of companies or two companies who today are very dominant in that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  space. But there is huge opportunity. We obviously have seen that there's still quite a lot of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1335.4399999999998s)]
*  opportunity to differentiate there, having made an investment this year in that space. I think an [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1341.28s)]
*  interesting, maybe not shift, but trend is that lots of diseases are today seen through [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1346.56s)]
*  a slightly different lens than they might have been in the past. One of those lenses is through [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1354.0s)]
*  immunology. A lot of things are now perceived to have quite a significant component of immunology [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  or inflammation in them. Everything from neuroscience, cancer, metabolic diseases, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1365.28s)]
*  dermatology, obviously. A lot of these other areas actually intersect with immunology a lot. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1371.44s)]
*  That's become very interesting for a lot of investors, not least because something that [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1376.24s)]
*  works may work in more than one disease and is not really limited to just that specific indication. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  When people are hunting really attractive ROI, like return on investment, things where you could [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1387.68s)]
*  apply it in multiple different diseases tend to look pretty attractive. I think also just [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  following the science, our understanding of certain diseases has just improved a lot [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1399.2s)]
*  over the last decade. I think neuroscience is a particularly interesting area with things like [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1403.44s)]
*  the first approvals for disease modifying Alzheimer's drugs, first approvals for ALS drugs. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1408.8s)]
*  There's just been a lot more progress. People are more willing to take on diseases that we all know [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1415.3600000000001s)]
*  have huge economic and personal impact on patients. That's been quite exciting. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1421.92s)]
*  Across all of these different diseases, probably the theme that I guess we're maybe not most excited, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1426.8s)]
*  but very excited about is just having a precision lens. You may have previously looked at a disease [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1432.56s)]
*  like say Parkinson's disease and viewed it as a single disease, but actually the way that we like [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1440.72s)]
*  to look at things now is much more precise way. Actually, that's a range of different patient [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1445.9199999999998s)]
*  phenotypes and genotypes in there. Actually, a one size fits all drug is probably not going to be the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1451.6s)]
*  right way. Everyone in the biotech community is very comfortable with viewing oncology that way. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1458.48s)]
*  We have drugs that are approved for patients with a very specific mutation in the tumors. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1465.28s)]
*  We routinely genetically test those tumors and see what treatments a patient might be eligible [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1471.52s)]
*  that are very bespoke and personalized to them. I think doing the same thing in other disease areas [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1478.0s)]
*  is something that we're quite interested in. For example, one of our portfolio companies, Neuron 23, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1483.52s)]
*  has developed a companion diagnostic for their Parkinson's drug. They're finding patients based [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1490.24s)]
*  on range of polymorphisms, SNPs, and finding patients who would be eligible and most likely [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1495.52s)]
*  to benefit from their Parkinson's drug, which is a look to inhibit that kind of approach in diseases, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1501.44s)]
*  which you've typically not thought of as being 10 different micro diseases, I think is a theme that [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1507.52s)]
*  we're seeing applied everywhere because people want to increase probability of success, even if [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1513.6s)]
*  that reduces the population a little bit, which is what happened in cancer, say 10, 15 years ago. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1519.04s)]
*  We hear a lot about treatments that cost in the millions per dose. How do you focus on the patients [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1525.6s)]
*  and the need as opposed to those high-end treatments in terms of generating profits? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1534.0s)]
*  I think ultimately what it comes down to is what I was saying before, which is you focus on creating [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1541.04s)]
*  value as the north star. Even thinking like an HTA body like NICE or ISA in the US, what is the cost [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1546.72s)]
*  benefit analysis that a payer system might apply to this? Is on occasion entirely appropriate [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1557.68s)]
*  to pay a lot of money for an intervention if it saves a patient's life and saves the health [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1565.76s)]
*  system millions of dollars over the life of that patient, for example, rare neurodegenerative [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1572.24s)]
*  diseases in children or things where the alternative is repeat organ transplant and high [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1578.72s)]
*  touch, I guess, in patient care for a patient. I think the price of drugs and therapeutics that [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1587.44s)]
*  are being created has to be proportional to the benefit that you're getting from them. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1594.16s)]
*  I think we do believe that there is still quite a lot of opportunity to deliver a lot of value, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  even at relatively low prices, and it has to track with prevalence to a degree as you think [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1605.2s)]
*  about the impact on the healthcare system. But it's something we do think about a lot [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1611.68s)]
*  as we make new investments is one, how much value are you creating for that patient and for the [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1616.24s)]
*  healthcare system? But two, what can the system actually afford to pay? And if we were ever in a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1621.2s)]
*  position where you're rolling out a gene therapy for a disease that has millions of patients [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1626.8s)]
*  and you're trying to treat all of them, then you need structural changes in the system to either [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1633.52s)]
*  bring the cost of that down a lot or to find a way to make it variable for the healthcare system. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1638.4s)]
*  I think in general, where we have focused as a fund is on high acuity conditions, so high mortality [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1644.88s)]
*  or morbidity diseases, and therefore where the amount of value you can create for those patients [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1654.3200000000002s)]
*  is higher and therefore can tolerate higher pricing and hopefully be more immune from downward [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1660.16s)]
*  pressure on those innovative therapeutics coming to market. You were talking earlier about the way [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1665.68s)]
*  that AI is impacting biotech companies and how they're using that. Do you use AI now to run through [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1671.44s)]
*  different scenarios with companies and to inform your decisions? Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1680.3200000000002s)]
*  AI is everywhere now. I think one of the interesting things is that, say even three years ago when [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1687.6000000000001s)]
*  we used to talk to people about AI in life sciences, it was not necessarily niche, but it was [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1696.8000000000002s)]
*  certainly perceived to be nascent. Whereas now I would struggle to kind of name a company that we [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1704.72s)]
*  work with who doesn't somewhere use AI, even if they didn't develop it in-house, even if it's just [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  they are leveraging things like chat GPT to help them with certain tasks and certain procedures [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1718.16s)]
*  that they're running. And there's certainly a whole load of other accessible applications, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1724.48s)]
*  things like Alpha Fold, things like Nvidia's BioNemo platform. A lot of people are using that, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1728.96s)]
*  even if they didn't make it themselves. It's just becoming part of the toolkit that is available to [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1734.64s)]
*  a lot of these life sciences companies. So similarly, we will lean on some of these things [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1738.96s)]
*  during our due diligence process, during our landscaping of the market, during some of our [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1744.0s)]
*  benchmarking as we look to see what performance of a particular platform, what it can deliver, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1749.84s)]
*  you need to benchmark it against what's the state of the art. So yeah, we are adopting and using [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1756.1599999999999s)]
*  more and more of these tools. I would say that the most interesting things are probably beyond [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1763.04s)]
*  our technical capability as individuals in the investment team, given that our day job is [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1768.08s)]
*  primarily understanding the science and business and finance of these companies. And so we work [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1772.48s)]
*  with external advisors and consultants who can also help us stay abreast of the very latest [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1777.84s)]
*  on this stuff. But it's certainly quite a different environment than it was even just three years ago, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1784.3999999999999s)]
*  given how quickly and explosively these things have taken off. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1789.4399999999998s)]
*  Richard Lopate You can only assume that that's going to continue in the future. Clearly, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1792.32s)]
*  it's evolving quickly and it will continue to do so not just with biotech companies, but in general, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1797.12s)]
*  I guess. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the question is, at least in life sciences, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1804.48s)]
*  I feel like the question is really what applications you focus on and where you [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1808.4s)]
*  spend a lot of time and money on what problems you try and solve with it. Because there is a [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1812.24s)]
*  temptation that you could try and just create like the theory of everything sort of thing. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1816.8000000000002s)]
*  And that's intellectually very interesting and stimulating, but actually, the way that this [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1821.76s)]
*  industry is structured, the underlying insights and underlying capabilities are often not directly [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1826.8s)]
*  valued. Right in an M&A or in a public life sciences company, what people actually value is [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1835.2s)]
*  what they let you do that you couldn't do before. And so I think what it does force people to do is [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1842.3999999999999s)]
*  become super sharp on what they actually want to focus on. Like how do they use all of this toolkit? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  It's kind of the equivalent of being a builder who goes from using just a hammer and a spade [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1854.16s)]
*  to all of a sudden you have every single JCB digger and pneumatic drill and everything else [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1860.72s)]
*  you could possibly want. But at the end of the day, someone's going to buy a house for you. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1865.6000000000001s)]
*  Like so you need to figure out how you don't just waste your time just digging loads of holes and [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1870.16s)]
*  playing around with new tools. At the end of the day, you need to build a better house as a result. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1874.64s)]
*  And I guess that you don't spend all of your money on all that equipment and you end up making [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  one pound profit on the house, I guess. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It all has to be [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1883.6s)]
*  proportionate. And that's why what problem you pick is so important. And coming back to your [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  point about pricing of drugs, again, it needs to be not only did you pick a problem that was well [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1893.4399999999998s)]
*  suited to the tools, but you also picked a problem that created value for the healthcare system. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1898.7199999999998s)]
*  And therefore you can get paid for. You mentioned earlier that you work with [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1903.36s)]
*  companies in different regions. Could you maybe give us a bit of a snapshot as to where European [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1907.76s)]
*  biotech is in comparison to other regions and whether there are any trends in that respect? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1913.04s)]
*  Yeah. So our team is split over North America and Europe in the life sciences team, even though [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1918.8799999999999s)]
*  it's relatively evenly split. You know, a lot of our dollars have been invested in the US. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1924.48s)]
*  I think Europe and you know, this is not going to be particularly novel or insightful, but you know, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1930.0s)]
*  Europe has a lot of great science, has a lot of great innovation, fewer opportunities get to that [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1936.6399999999999s)]
*  latest stage, high ambition, high vision, high growth set up in Europe than in the US. Part of [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1943.36s)]
*  it is there's less capital available at the earlier stages to be really bold. I mean, the size of the [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  early stage rounds are definitely a lot smaller here, but it's also, I think, slightly cultural [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1956.8s)]
*  and slightly to do with access to talent. You know, we have made multiple investments in Europe [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1962.16s)]
*  and typically they have been, you know, if you ask people in the local ecosystems, people would have [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  said they were more American type companies, right? So they had management teams who had done it before. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1973.52s)]
*  They had probably some US investors who had come in alongside and had raised, you know, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1980.16s)]
*  aspirational amounts of money. I raised large rounds before they had delivered on everything [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1986.6399999999999s)]
*  that they would say they would do. But with the knowledge that actually to go after the plan that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1992.56s)]
*  they had, they would need that capital upfront to make the investment upfront and to be able to [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=1997.44s)]
*  pursue multiple things in parallel, rather than focus on one thing. Once it succeeded, then [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2002.08s)]
*  allocate a little bit of money to the second thing. I think European biotech is well placed after this [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2007.6s)]
*  period of, you know, I guess valuations coming down, people being much more sensitive about [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2013.84s)]
*  capital efficiency. By definition, almost European companies have had to be more capital efficient [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2018.56s)]
*  in the past because they didn't raise as much money. And so actually, you know, there's a lot [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2024.8799999999999s)]
*  of opportunity now for those same companies and same operators to go and deliver on very attractive [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2029.9199999999998s)]
*  business plans, delivering those clinical data quickly in a capital efficient way. We're actually [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2037.4399999999998s)]
*  already set up pretty well to do that. And I think this year has seen quite a few pretty reasonable [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2043.28s)]
*  biotech financings, you know, above $100 million. There were a few last week, you know, in Aston [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2049.36s)]
*  Jefferies week. And, you know, I think we're going to see more of that. I think the other thing is [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2054.72s)]
*  there is more availability of capital here than there was in the past. And we are seeing it [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2060.48s)]
*  flow through to some companies being better capitalized from day one. It just takes time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2065.44s)]
*  This is like planting seeds. And then it takes a couple of years for them to grow [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2071.68s)]
*  kind of big enough for investors like us to take a look. And so that cohort that's being planted [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  sort of over the last 12 months, you know, that'll be kind of 2025, 26, maybe even 27, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2081.44s)]
*  that they become kind of companies that we could look at. And we stay close to those. We connect [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2088.0s)]
*  with these companies early, we connect with their investors early. And we try to share with them [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2093.3599999999997s)]
*  what our vision would be if we were in their shoes and help, I guess, shape maybe a bit more [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2098.96s)]
*  of an ambitious business plan so that, you know, when we get there, they do have multiple programs [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2104.16s)]
*  that they're trying to take into the clinic, not just one. And they do have a platform that [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2109.68s)]
*  they've invested in, not given up on after they got their first program, you know, out of it. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2113.92s)]
*  It's on a good trajectory, but there's definitely still this divide that we see. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2120.0s)]
*  I guess we're getting to the end of 2024. Now, are there any things that you're looking forward to in [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2124.72s)]
*  25, kind of the crystal ball thing? Are there any sort of landmarks for 25 that you're looking to, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2131.2s)]
*  both in the sector and also financially? Yeah, I mean, we sort of talked about earlier, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2137.68s)]
*  just how at the end of 24, we've just entered this period of maybe a lack of clarity or lack of, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2144.08s)]
*  you know, certainty on a few things. But I think broadly speaking, after three years, really, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2149.28s)]
*  of the environment being tougher, I am hopeful that it's warming up for next year, that interest [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2154.5600000000004s)]
*  rates will continue to come down, even if it's a bit slower than we would like. And that you'll see [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2159.84s)]
*  a bit more farmer M&A, you know, at a scale that returns capital to a lot of the ecosystem and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2166.1600000000003s)]
*  makes people more likely to deploy more, that helps the LPs and all the funds get more excited [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2171.1200000000003s)]
*  coming back. I think the IPO window will open next year. I think there's a question of when, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2176.0800000000004s)]
*  but I believe it will open. And that unlocks quite a lot of value for a lot of people, because, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2181.92s)]
*  you know, over the last couple of years, we've had a lot of good quality companies staying private [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2187.0400000000004s)]
*  and getting later and later stage and, you know, delivering better and better data. And so actually, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2192.32s)]
*  when that window is open, the type of IPOs you'll be seeing will be very different to the type we [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2197.44s)]
*  saw the last time the window was fully open, because last time it was very aspirational, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2202.88s)]
*  it was stories, potential preclinical companies kind of telling a narrative that sounded very [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2207.36s)]
*  attractive and kind of a lot of those milestones in the future. Whereas, you know, a lot of the [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2214.7200000000003s)]
*  companies that are gearing up for IPOs now have actually delivered clinical data, have already got [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2219.04s)]
*  something tangible. I think a lot of potential for next year for this to be, you know, a really [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2223.92s)]
*  important moment for these companies to get financed and for potentially some of that capital [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2229.68s)]
*  to be recycled into the ecosystem. And what about from your own company's perspective? What are you [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2233.6s)]
*  looking forward to in 2025? So from our own company's perspective, I mean, I think we've got [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2239.04s)]
*  similar themes, right? So a lot of those companies, we would have expected at the time that when we [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2244.72s)]
*  invested in them, that they would have been public by now. And many of them that we came into when [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2249.44s)]
*  they were preclinical are now firmly in the clinic and running pretty innovative clinical [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2254.56s)]
*  trials with interesting and differentiated drugs. So I think some IPOs in our portfolio, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2259.44s)]
*  I think would be a reasonable assumption if the window is open. Maybe some of them are more suited [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2265.92s)]
*  to pharma M&A if they have the right data set at the right point in time. We are quite excited [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2270.56s)]
*  about, you know, ecosystem benefits, you know, I think increased cooperation and collaboration, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  even between our portfolio companies will continue. But I think overall, we feel pretty optimistic. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2283.44s)]
*  By 2025, certainly compared to how we felt, you know, at the end of 2022 or the end of 2023, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2289.28s)]
*  the end of 2024 feels like a more optimistic moment. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2296.0800000000004s)]
*  As 2024 draws to a close, a great overview of the life sciences scene, funding, and some potential [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_ioWKA_Ys&t=2304.1600000000003s)]
