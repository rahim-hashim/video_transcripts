# BioSenic developing severe knee osteoarthritis treatment
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 81. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. This week we're looking at, among other things, a treatment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=16.72s)]
*  for severe knee osteoarthritis from the Belgian headquartered company BioSenic. One of BioSenic's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=23.4s)]
*  products, JTA-004, is an intraarticular viscose supplement treatment for knee osteoarthritis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=31.839999999999996s)]
*  And to tell us more about that and the other conditions and treatments the company is working [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=39.8s)]
*  on is BioSenic chief scientific officer and chief operating officer, Carole Nicot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=45.28s)]
*  The first and hopefully easiest question is if you could tell me a little bit about the company. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=51.4s)]
*  Yes, so BioSenic is a reverse merger. It's coming from the reverse merger of two companies, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=57.16s)]
*  a small company in France named MedSenic. MedSenic was born, I would say, in 2007, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=64.16s)]
*  I think. I wasn't there at this moment. It's mainly the CEO, Francois Rieger, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=74.08s)]
*  the deputy CEO, Véronique Pommie. They created this MedSenic company because they had a really [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=80.28s)]
*  interesting technology, arsenic trioxide, to treat autoimmune diseases. And in 2022, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=88.08s)]
*  MedSenic reverse merged with Bone Therapeutics, a listed company from Belgium. Bone Therapeutics [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=96.92s)]
*  was owning cell therapy, TALO, to treat difficult fractures, and another technology, JTA, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=107.92s)]
*  to treat osteoarthritis. The first problem Bone Therapeutics had is that clinical phase 3, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=119.08s)]
*  clinical trial phase 3 with JTA, was a failure. And even though this product is really interesting, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=128.64s)]
*  it was a failure. And then Bone Therapeutics started to have problems to continue with its [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=138.92s)]
*  other technology, ALOPE. Anyway, another clinical trial was going on, clinical phase 2 clinical [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  trial on difficult fractures, tibial difficult fractures. And the reverse merger occurred in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=155.76s)]
*  October 2022. And so BioSenic inherited an ALOPE clinical trial phase 2, still going on, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=165.16s)]
*  but not finished. A JTA technology to treat osteoarthritis. And we have also this arsenic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=175.8s)]
*  trioxide to treat autoimmune diseases. Here now, mainly chronic graft versus osteosis. And for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  this technology, we are preparing a clinical trial phase 3. I know you have different treatments that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  we're going to go into. I wonder if first we could talk about the knee osteoarthritis and what it is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=201.84s)]
*  and what the current treatments are and why there's been a need for new treatments? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=209.24s)]
*  Osteoarthritis is a really huge pathology. Around 60 million people worldwide have this disease. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a disease that can be stratified in different types of osteoarthritis. And this has been evidence [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=225.32s)]
*  from time to time. And in 2022, an article really evidence that there are clusters of osteoarthritis. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  It can be a mechanical etiology of the pathology with age and with the way of living you have, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=243.88s)]
*  what you're near is submitted to, body weight or sport or whatever. But an immune cluster has also [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=253.84s)]
*  been evidenced. Today, there is no real treatment to treat osteoarthritis. There are some drug [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=263.72s)]
*  products to avoid pain, pain relief, but there is no real treatment. Today, the most known and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=273.24s)]
*  renowned treatment is Sinvisoan. It's a hyaluronic acid treatment based on hyaluronic acid. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=282.44s)]
*  And it's mainly something mechanical like a cushion that is injected into the knee to avoid the pain. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=291.44s)]
*  But there is no real treatment. JTA was the treatment that Biocenic evaluated in a clinical trial, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=302.28s)]
*  phase three. And when this clinical trial was implemented, the clusters of the different type [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=313.08s)]
*  of patients was not really known and evidenced. So the clinical trial and JTA was applied to people [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=322.84s)]
*  from all the clusters. It means that there was an heterogeneity of the patients. And it could be an [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=334.28s)]
*  explanation of the failure. The treatment we have with JTA is more specific with patients with immune [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  form of osteoarthritis. So today, we have a treatment that failed in a clinical trial, phase three, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  but I think should be used in just a part of the patients. And this is the most severe and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=360.52s)]
*  inflammatory part of the patients. So this needs to have another clinical trial, of course. But with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=370.36s)]
*  the results we have today, because we did a post hoc analysis of what we obtained during the previous [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=378.68s)]
*  clinical trial, phase three, we see that this compound could be a real treatment for severe [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=386.52s)]
*  osteoarthritis patients. And why? It's because in this drug, we have a compound that is named [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=394.68s)]
*  clonidine. And clonidine is an anesthetic, the first mechanism of action of this drug. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=403.48s)]
*  But recently, it was evidenced that it has also anti-inflammatory actions. And also that clonidine [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=413.32s)]
*  acts specifically on chondrocytes that are implicated in the pathology of osteoarthritis. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=424.44s)]
*  And it acts on special voltage dependent pores that help to relieve the pain. So here we have [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=431.8s)]
*  a drug that has multiple mechanism of action that are really interesting in osteoarthritis, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=441.88000000000005s)]
*  severe inflammatory osteoarthritis. Could you tell me a little bit about the ALOB program? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=450.04s)]
*  So ALOB is cell therapy. ALOB means Allogenic Bone. This treatment comes from the use of stem cells [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=457.72s)]
*  that are cultured specifically to be oriented as chondrocytes. And this cell therapy was designed [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=469.48s)]
*  to be used as bone repair therapy. The aim is to repair the bone with injecting this cells [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=482.6s)]
*  where production of bone producing cells could proliferate to repair the bone. Bone therapeutics [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  initially used this therapy in clinical trial phase two for spinal fusion and also for bone [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  repairing. And the two first trial were a success. So after those two interesting success, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=511.32s)]
*  they decided to use it in a clinical trial phase two for a tibial fracture repairing, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=519.88s)]
*  difficult tibial fracture repair. And the clinical trial started in 2019 with this [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=528.76s)]
*  really interesting therapy. It's a cell therapy, but as you know, cell therapy can be difficult [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=537.88s)]
*  to manage because you have to have the production and the injection really rapidly because you [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=544.68s)]
*  cannot preserve the cells usually. With ALOB, what is interesting is that it's cryopreserved. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  The bone therapeutics and biosonic have this technology of cell repairing that you can [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=559.56s)]
*  in stock and preserve for nearly 40 months. And we know the stability of this product, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=567.48s)]
*  this cell therapy for between 36 and 40 months cryopreserved. So that's really interesting. So [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  the clinical trial phase two started for difficult tibial fracture and few problems [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  occurred at the same time. It started in 2019 when COVID started. And so tibial fracture [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=590.2s)]
*  at this period decreased because no one was doing ski or motorcycle or whatever. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=598.36s)]
*  So it was the first problem. The cell therapy was ready at this period, but you can cryopreserve [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=605.08s)]
*  for 36 to 40 months and not more. So you have to have the recruitment really fast. And [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=612.6s)]
*  it's one of the problems that happened. And that's one of the problems why we had a failure. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=620.2s)]
*  The other problem is that you have to find the best way, the best volume, the best way to inject [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  your product. And it was decided to inject this product just directly after the fracture. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=632.52s)]
*  And we found out post-doc that maybe it was not the best protocol because when you inject [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=640.2s)]
*  just directly after the fracture, you have a period where the cells are not in the best [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=648.04s)]
*  condition to proliferate. It would have been better to inject maybe the cells later, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=657.48s)]
*  as in the previous other clinical trial using ALOB. And it has not been designed this way. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=665.56s)]
*  So this failure of ALOB is really maybe also due to bad circumstances. And what I would like to say [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=674.6s)]
*  is that ALOB is a great product, could have great results. Here again, other clinical trial with [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=683.96s)]
*  another design and other circumstances would be great for this technology, cryopreserved, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=691.72s)]
*  and could be really helpful for patients with difficult fractures. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=699.64s)]
*  What's the JTA004 and how does that work? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=705.56s)]
*  JTA004 is a mix of hyaluronic acid, clonidin, and plasmatic proteins. With this product, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=711.08s)]
*  we have the combination of really interesting mechanic and biologic parameters that can act [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=723.0s)]
*  in the same way to treat severe inflammatory osteoarthritis. The hyaluronic acid is a viscous [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=734.8399999999999s)]
*  supplement. It's like the known symbisquine. The action of hyaluronic acid is mainly mechanical [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=744.6s)]
*  because it's, I would say, like a cushion. It's a soft product that can help to avoid the friction [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  in the knee. Also, and it's quite recent, hyaluronic acid can also act on some cells, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=763.24s)]
*  immune cells that have CD44 receptors on their membrane. But it's not well known today, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=773.88s)]
*  but hyaluronic acid could have this action on immune cells to help avoid inflammation in the knee. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=782.28s)]
*  Here, what we have on the top of hyaluronic acid is clonidin. I think that clonidin is a really [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  interesting element of the product because clonidin is well known for its anesthetic effect [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=800.6s)]
*  because it acts on alpha-2 adrenal receptors on cells. That's well known. That's how it acts [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=809.48s)]
*  as an anesthetic. Clonidin also acts as an anti-inflammatory compound. That's the second [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=818.36s)]
*  mechanism of action of clonidin that is really interesting in osteoarthritis. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=827.72s)]
*  This is a little bit less known that it's an anesthetic effect, but it's also really recognized. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=833.64s)]
*  Clonidin can act on lymphocytes, apoptosis, and so reduce pro-inflammatory reactions in the knee. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=841.32s)]
*  The third mechanism of clonidin is that it can act directly on some precise receptors [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=853.0s)]
*  that will act on voltage sodium channels and avoid pain. With this triple mechanism of action [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=861.16s)]
*  of clonidin, we really have a compound that is designed for osteoarthritis because these are the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=871.32s)]
*  phenomenon that occur pain, inflammation in the cluster of severe and inflammatory [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=878.84s)]
*  osteoarthritis patients. We also have plasmatic proteins and these proteins mainly act mechanically [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=887.4s)]
*  to make a soft viscous supplement to avoid the mechanical stress on the knee. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=896.84s)]
*  I know you're going to be giving a presentation at the OARSO World Conference in the spring, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=903.08s)]
*  so I obviously can't ask you to give away anything that you're going to be saying there, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=910.04s)]
*  but can you tell me what the attendance at the meeting means and what you'll be presenting there? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=914.28s)]
*  We're going to present the results of the post-hoc analysis. As I mentioned, there was a clinical [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=921.0s)]
*  trial phase three that was realized and considered as a failure, but when you have negative results, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=930.76s)]
*  and as a really pure scientist, I know that results that can seem to be negative are the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=940.2s)]
*  most interesting in fact because with these results, you have something to analyze and to [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=950.76s)]
*  understand why and how it works. So with the results of the clinical trial phase three of JTA, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=956.44s)]
*  we analyzed why we had these results. Were the results the same on all the patients? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  And knowing that there were some clusters of patients, we reanalyzed the results, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=971.5600000000001s)]
*  separating the different types of patients. We focused on the severe inflammatory patients [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=977.96s)]
*  with high CRP, which is a marker of inflammation in the blood. We focused on these patients. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=985.8s)]
*  This post-hoc analysis was done with an external company, evidence that for these patients, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=994.3599999999999s)]
*  the treatment, JTA treatment, was a real benefit in terms of stiffness, pain, and the markers, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  the biomarkers were better for these patients after the treatment. So that's what we're going [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1015.56s)]
*  to present in this congress and at the same time, we patented this application of JTA on this cluster [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1021.56s)]
*  of patients. Is that event something where people just present results or is it one where [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1032.76s)]
*  you can sometimes see launches of new products and new treatments? No, it's mainly presentation [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1039.7199999999998s)]
*  of results, but it's true that this kind of events, that's where you can meet people. It can be [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1047.7199999999998s)]
*  medical doctors, but biopharma also. And you can have really interesting interactions to [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1056.12s)]
*  evaluate or present your product for the next steps. Because here we're talking about [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  technology that we don't want to continue the development. JTA is the final product and this [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  product could be used just as it is. It doesn't need more development. It needs a company to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1078.68s)]
*  license it and to do another clinical trial phase three, because it's really a very interesting and [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1087.16s)]
*  good compound by itself. Biocenic wants to do more development on this compound, but we'll be really [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1094.44s)]
*  happy to have partnered to be able to go further in clinical trial, to redesign a clinical trial [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1103.56s)]
*  phase three with the good right patients. I'm so sure that it's really a compound that could treat [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  this kind of osteoarthritis and so many patients nowadays need this kind of treatments. You only [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1119.72s)]
*  have treatments that avoid pain for a few months for now and no treatment at all. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1127.96s)]
*  It's really a difficult disease that 60 million people worldwide. So even if we have a third of [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1136.2800000000002s)]
*  this passion that could be treated by JTA, can you imagine all those people suffering from [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1144.7600000000002s)]
*  this disease? It's enormous and this drug product is ready and that's the difficulty of bio-pharma [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1152.44s)]
*  nowadays because we can have really great compounds, but to bring it to the passions, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1160.92s)]
*  you have to have successful clinical trial. When you do a trial, it's a trial. You don't know before [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1167.3200000000002s)]
*  the best way to evaluate and if there is a failure because a small parameter, you have to start from [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1175.48s)]
*  the beginning of the clinical trial and it's million and million of euros to start again, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1183.08s)]
*  even if you are very close to evidence that the campaign is really good. Like JTA, we have really [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1190.1999999999998s)]
*  interesting results on this cluster on a clinical trial phase three with almost 800 [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1197.4s)]
*  patients. So it's enormous, but today if we want to go to the passions, we have to start again the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1204.68s)]
*  trial. We're not ready to develop more on this because it's ready and it needs partners. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1211.96s)]
*  All right, is it just a one-off treatment? You only have to give it once? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1220.2s)]
*  For now, yeah, we plan to do it once and evaluate on one injection, but we don't know now. We don't [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1224.0400000000002s)]
*  have enough background to evaluate what we would have to do after one, two or more years. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1233.16s)]
*  Passion might need more than one injection, but it's a treatment and not only as what we have on [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1241.96s)]
*  the market now like CymbisQon, the drug, the treatment, I mean the compound that we have [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1252.36s)]
*  today on the markets are really not drug treatments. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1259.0s)]
*  You mentioned how difficult it is. Are there other companies working on treatments for this condition? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1265.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. There are other clinical trials going on and other treatments with pain-relief [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1271.6399999999999s)]
*  drugs. What I would like to introduce here, it's another compound that we're working [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1279.24s)]
*  with in Biosenic. It's arsenic trioxide because here we're talking about conidine that acts on [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1287.0s)]
*  some part of the lymphocytes immune and relief mechanism of action. Arsenic trioxide is another [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1295.16s)]
*  drug product that Biosenic owns and it's a really powerful compound to modulate immunity and [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1305.64s)]
*  autoimmunity. Why I'm talking now about this molecule is because we plan to use it in one day. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1315.96s)]
*  This goes to implement for now. We're closer to have oral form of treatment with arsenic trioxide, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1326.8400000000001s)]
*  but one day we plan to have viscous supplements. I think the treatment of immune diseases, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1335.08s)]
*  autoimmune immune diseases such as this cluster of osteoarthritis and other immune diseases [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1343.3999999999999s)]
*  need new innovative compounds. Arsenic trioxide is a really interesting powerful drug that could be [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1351.8s)]
*  really revolutionary in my opinion to treat such kind of diseases. I know arsenic trioxide because [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1363.72s)]
*  I studied it in my previous position as a scientist in an academic lab. I was evaluating [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1374.92s)]
*  at a pre-clinical level different type of compound molecules and arsenic trioxide is the one that [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1384.44s)]
*  I found is the most interesting and is the one why I decided to move from academic to private [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1393.8s)]
*  to bring this molecule farther than pre-clinical evaluation. I think that this compound, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1403.32s)]
*  arsenic trioxide, is a compound that could be incredibly useful for patients with really [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1412.04s)]
*  difficult diseases, autoimmune immune diseases. We should be able to bring it to patients [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1421.0s)]
*  for osteoarthritis, for systemic sclerosis, for chronic graft versus osteoarthritis. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1427.72s)]
*  I think that some molecule needs to really be brought to the patients because they're [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  really interesting and unknown today. Where are you at with the work on that in terms of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1444.6s)]
*  clinical trials? Arsenic trioxide is a molecule that is known for 3000 years to treat diseases but [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1451.8799999999999s)]
*  just at the end of the 19th century it was rediscovered as a treatment of blood cancer [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1464.76s)]
*  and arsenic trioxide is used since 2000 to treat a certain form of blood cancer. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1473.48s)]
*  We, MedSenic, use this molecule that is already used in patients to treat cancer. We use it, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1481.24s)]
*  we would like to use it in patients with autoimmune diseases and here we already did a clinical trial [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1491.9599999999998s)]
*  phase two to treat chronic graft versus osteosaric disease. This clinical trial phase two was a [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1498.44s)]
*  success. We finished the trial in 2021. We published the results in 2022 and now we're [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1505.4s)]
*  preparing a phase three clinical trial with noro root to treat patients. Previously it was an IV [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1515.48s)]
*  root so now we developed a noro root to treat chronic graft versus osteosis. This disease [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1524.6s)]
*  occurs when patients graft for a blood cancer develop an autoimmune disease. The graft reacts [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1532.04s)]
*  against the patients and the chronic graft versus osteosis occur. So we're going to start this [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1544.04s)]
*  clinical trial phase three this year and then we would like to use this treatment also to treat [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1551.56s)]
*  two other pathologies because we also have pre-clinical results and clinical phase two [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1562.04s)]
*  results on lupus and systemic sclerosis. So this treatment, oral arsenic trioxide treatment, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1567.8s)]
*  is really an innovative treatment for the future of autoimmune diseases. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1577.24s)]
*  Will it apply to, equally to, lots of different autoimmune diseases you think? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1586.52s)]
*  Yes, I think that today it's chronic graft versus osteosis but the next step I would say is systemic [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1591.88s)]
*  sclerosis. I evaluated the effect of arsenic trioxide but combined with another molecule, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1599.56s)]
*  copper, and I evidence in pre-clinical models in vitro and in vivo that the combination of [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1609.0s)]
*  arsenic trioxide and copper allows to decrease the dosage of arsenic trioxide and to treat [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1617.24s)]
*  systemic sclerosis in a mice pre-clinical model. So we are going to develop this new combination [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1627.24s)]
*  which is patented exclusively by Biosenic. We're developing the oral form of arsenic trioxide [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1636.1999999999998s)]
*  combined with copper to treat first systemic sclerosis and then we would like to apply this [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1645.8s)]
*  treatment also to lupus. It's different from the treatment that we hear about nowadays. You hear [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1653.16s)]
*  about immune treatment, antibodies treatment, all the main treatments that we hear about nowadays [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1662.52s)]
*  are really specific treatments acting on one pathway. They will act on CD20, on this and this [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1672.2s)]
*  pathway on the immune cells and it's really these treatments that are under clinical trial phase [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1684.68s)]
*  two or three nowadays are really specific of one pathway, one mechanism that is dysregulated during [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1692.36s)]
*  the disease. With arsenic trioxide what is interesting is that it acts on different pathways. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1703.24s)]
*  Apoptosis, it acts on the mitochondria, it can act on epigenetics also [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1711.24s)]
*  and it acts only on the cells when they are over activated. So it means that when you treat with [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1719.0s)]
*  arsenic trioxide if there is no need to act in the cells on some pathways arsenic won't have any action [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1727.0s)]
*  and will be eliminated. But if there is a pathway where arsenic trioxide can act or if it can be [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1738.52s)]
*  if it can be fixed on a protein on somewhere in the cell it will act. And this is really interesting [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1747.64s)]
*  because it's not specific it will act only if there is another activated mechanism. The other [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1757.88s)]
*  thing is that arsenic trioxide not only acts on immune cells but also on other types of cells [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1765.64s)]
*  like fibroblasts, synovial blasts that are over activated and are also cells that are [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1774.52s)]
*  implicated in the mechanism of fibrosis of a lot of autoimmune diseases. What are the next steps? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1782.76s)]
*  I'm now the CEO and CSO of Biocenics so I think that we need to have short, medium and long-term [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1792.12s)]
*  strategies. So the clinical trial phase three is the nowadays strategy we have to start with [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1799.88s)]
*  this clinical trial phase three. So that's for arsenic trioxide clinical trial phase three. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1807.48s)]
*  At the same time I think that the use of arsenic trioxide in systemic sclerosis [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1813.4s)]
*  should be a medium aim of biocenic and we should be able to have the treatment in about three years [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1820.2800000000002s)]
*  and be able to start a clinical trial phase two in three years and a half on systemic sclerosis. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1829.08s)]
*  At the same time we have JTA and ALOB that are ready and if we find partners we are ready to [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1836.84s)]
*  start from now with these two technologies to treat patients as soon as possible. The only thing on [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1843.96s)]
*  these two technologies the only I mean only but the big problem also is to find partners [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1851.8s)]
*  but those two technologies are ready to to be used mainly JTA is really ready to be used for patients. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1858.68s)]
*  Quite a diverse pipeline there at Biocenic. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lVAYFjMoA&t=1873.4s)]
