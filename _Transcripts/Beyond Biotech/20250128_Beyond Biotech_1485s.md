# The future of combination vaccines
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 108. I'm Jim Connell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. This week we have an in-depth conversation about combination [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=17.16s)]
*  vaccines, from what they are to what they can be used for via Covid and bird flu and what the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=24.36s)]
*  future holds for combination vaccines. And who better to walk us through the subject than Cesar [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=31.24s)]
*  Sanz Rodriguez, Vice President, Europe and Switzerland, Medical Affairs at Moderna. So I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  guess the first question then is if you could tell me a little bit about the technology that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  allows for a combination vaccine and how that was developed. Yes, so as you know, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=50.8s)]
*  combination vaccines do have a huge potential for impacting public health and global health [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=59.04s)]
*  outcomes. And for that very same reason, they've been really top of mind for clinical developers [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=64.6s)]
*  over time. So actually the interest in developing combination vaccines goes back to the 1940s where [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=69.12s)]
*  when the first combination vaccine was developed, I'm talking about the DTP vaccine which targets [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=74.56s)]
*  diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. And that was essentially a combination of toxoids. But then [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=80.32s)]
*  over time with advancements in immunology, molecular biology and biotechnology, there's been a number of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=85.6s)]
*  advancements that have enabled further developments. So for instance, the use of acubans to enhance [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  immunogenicity, the application of DNA technology, recombinant DNA technology in the 17s and 80s. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=98.32s)]
*  And you know, the hepatitis vaccines are good examples of that. Or also the use of subunit [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=105.04s)]
*  and conjugate vaccines are good examples of how that progress has been made. In recent years, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  we have seen more sophisticated technology advancements. So I would say there's primarily [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=115.12s)]
*  two. One is the use of virus-like particles. These are essentially particles that mimic [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  the structure of a virus but do not contain any genetic material from the virus. So that makes [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=125.12s)]
*  them very safe. And the other one is connected to advances in genetic engineering and synthetic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=129.52s)]
*  biology, which allows you to design antigens as you wish. And then also essentially the advancements [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=135.36s)]
*  in nanotechnology, which have helped with the delivery of such antigens. So this all comes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=141.52s)]
*  together actually in the mRNA technology, which was proven to be very powerful during the COVID-19 [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  pandemic as you all know. In fact, the mRNA technology is also very well suited for the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=151.68s)]
*  development of combination vaccines because you can actually design multiple antigens. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=157.76s)]
*  And also the scalability and the flexibility of the platform allows for very rapid production times. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  So that's the reason why it's been really one of the areas of attention recently. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  What are the main advantages of vaccines that target multiple respiratory viruses at the same time? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=173.6s)]
*  There are actually several, I would say significant advantages. And these benefits extend [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=181.68s)]
*  both to individuals who benefit in terms of health outcomes, but then also to the societal [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  perspective of public health and healthcare systems altogether. So to me, the first one I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=192.8s)]
*  would like to highlight is the opportunity for improved vaccination coverage and compliance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  And this really comes with the simplicity that combination vaccines offer. Simplicity because, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=203.04s)]
*  you know, number one, there are fewer injections. And that really helps some of us who are a bit [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=208.0s)]
*  scared of needles become more inclined to accept the vaccination. Also, you know, vaccination [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=212.72s)]
*  calendars are getting busy. There are many different vaccines that we need to protect against. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=218.56s)]
*  And obviously having the opportunity to combine different pathogens in one vaccine, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=222.88s)]
*  that simplifies also the compliance with those vaccination calendars. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=227.36s)]
*  Altogether, this translates into enhanced public health outcomes. So we have broader [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=231.52s)]
*  protection in the population. We increase the overall immunity in the population. And also by [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=236.72s)]
*  preventing diseases, you know, we reduce the burden of disease associated with those infections. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=242.48s)]
*  And so, for instance, if you take the example of respiratory infections, you know, we are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=248.16s)]
*  now thinking about, you know, what's going to happen in the fall, for instance, with the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=252.48s)]
*  influenza and the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns, prevention of such respiratory infections will [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=256.56s)]
*  lead to fewer hospitalizations, medical visits and complications. And then on top of that, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=261.44s)]
*  there's also, I would say, economic and logistical benefits. So first of all, in terms of cost [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=268.0s)]
*  effectiveness, the prevention of multiple diseases through the use of a single vaccine [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=272.88s)]
*  can definitely help reduce the overall healthcare costs associated with treating those infections. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=278.48s)]
*  And also it allows for a more efficient use of resources. So, you know, resources that can be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=284.32s)]
*  spared by using combination vaccines can then be redeployed for other purposes and to address other [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=289.44s)]
*  areas of unmet medical need. And this is particularly true in context of low resource access, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=295.2s)]
*  which is the case in some countries across the globe. So I think for all these reasons, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=301.52s)]
*  we have seen vaccination with combination vaccines become quite the standard in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  pediatric, for instance, in the pediatric segments. And there is also, I think, a big [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=311.28s)]
*  opportunity to have some of these benefits also in other patient groups at high risk for infections, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=316.24s)]
*  such as the elderly, people with immunocompromised immune systems, or essentially people who have, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=321.84s)]
*  you know, one or more underlying conditions, you know, they all may benefit from the use [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  of combination vaccines. You're mentioning the cost. There's probably also a good case to be [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=331.11999999999995s)]
*  made for the fact that people don't have to travel three times to get three injections. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=338.08s)]
*  They don't know and you have to travel once. So that's probably a savings environmentally as well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=343.28s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. But I think, you know, from my point of view, I mean, that cost is there, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  of course, but I think it's more about, again, making vaccination more friendly to those of us [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  who may benefit from it. In terms of the efficacy, how does the immune system tackle [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  dealing with multiple pathogens at once? So the risk of, you know, of infection produced by [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=366.72s)]
*  different pathogens at the same time is actually something very real we deal with as human beings. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=373.12s)]
*  So I'm sure many of our listeners have actually read recently in the newspapers about the concept [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=377.68s)]
*  of the triplodemic, which is essentially the big surge of infections we have seen associated with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=382.88s)]
*  influenza virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the virus causing COVID-19, and then also the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=388.0s)]
*  respiratory disease, the virus. And it's not only that they produce many infections, they actually [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=393.76s)]
*  sometimes happen at the same time, which makes the situation more complex for those affected. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=398.24s)]
*  So the good news is our immune system is actually well equipped to deal with that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=403.6s)]
*  And that is because of, I would say, three elements, you know, three key elements of our [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  immune system. So first of all, we have a diverse repertoire of B cells. These are the white blood [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  cells that produce antibodies. We also have, you know, T cells, T lymphocytes, the so-called helper [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=416.72s)]
*  T cells or CT4+, which actually help also in the development of that immune response. And then within [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  the lymphoid organs, there are some very specialized structures called germinal centers, which also [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=428.32000000000005s)]
*  help in that process. So essentially what happens is that, you know, when the immune system is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=433.36s)]
*  exposed to antigens present in those pathogens that are co-infecting, different B cells will get [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=438.24s)]
*  activated. So essentially each activated B cell clone will produce a specific type of antibody, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=444.64s)]
*  but altogether we have different clones that are being activated. So we are able to really produce [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=450.72s)]
*  antibodies against all those pathogens. And this is actually the same principle that we take advantage [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=456.16s)]
*  of when we think of designing combination vaccines. Essentially in these vaccines, we bring [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=461.36s)]
*  together different antigens and in doing so, we will essentially trigger an antibody response [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=466.48s)]
*  against all those antigens by different B cell clones that will be activated. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=472.64s)]
*  Are there any differences in efficacy or safety between giving multiple vaccines separately as [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  opposed to altogether? I'm really happy you're asking that question because that's actually a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=486.8s)]
*  question oftentimes people have when they think of taking a combination vaccine as opposed to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  the individual counterparts. Generally speaking, combination vaccines are designed to be as effective [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=497.6s)]
*  and as safe as their individual counterparts. And this is very clearly outlined in guidance that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  different regulatory agencies have produced. I mean, this is the case, for instance, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=509.2s)]
*  for the FDA in the USA and the European Medicines Agency in the European Union. In fact, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=513.36s)]
*  just to illustrate this point, the European Medicines Agency, IMA, has actually developed [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=518.64s)]
*  a guidance that includes very clearly detailed instructions as to how a vaccine should be [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=523.84s)]
*  assessed both from an efficacy and a safety point of view. So when it comes to efficacy, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  the efficacy of combination vaccines is actually assessed based on immunogenicity studies, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=534.72s)]
*  how strong of an immune response they are able to produce. Clinical efficacy trials may also be [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=539.52s)]
*  required. And then also, very importantly, companies are also required to demonstrate [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  that the efficacy of the vaccine is actually consistent across the multiple production batches [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=549.84s)]
*  so that there is essentially a reliable vaccine to be used in a broader scale. And then the safety [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=555.04s)]
*  of the combination vaccines is also extensively evaluated. And again, this is based on preclinical [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=561.36s)]
*  studies, including toxicology studies. Again, clinical safety trials may be important. Once [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=566.08s)]
*  the vaccine is in use, there's also a very broad program of post-marketing surveillance. So [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  essentially, all the pharmacovigilance mechanisms are in place to understand if there's any new [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=577.44s)]
*  safety concern. And also, oftentimes, vaccine manufacturers are required to put in place [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=582.72s)]
*  the so-called risk management plans. And these are important to not only identify, but also to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=589.6s)]
*  mitigate potential risks associated with the use of combination vaccines. So I think the message [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=594.64s)]
*  I would like to close with is really that clinicians and the population overall should all be reassured [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=600.08s)]
*  that when they see a combination vaccine, even if it's a combination vaccine that has been developed [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=606.64s)]
*  with the newer technologies I was talking about before, these vaccines are actually very rigorously [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=611.68s)]
*  assessed. And they meet all stringent and also very comprehensive criteria for efficacy and safety. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=616.64s)]
*  And I assume in terms of boosters, we've had the COVID where we needed to get one every, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=623.36s)]
*  I don't know, it changed over time. But would boosters still be required? And how would you [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=629.6s)]
*  manage the fact that maybe some of these have different lengths of periods of time between [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=635.76s)]
*  injections? So boosters are sometimes required for combination vaccines, but just as they are as well [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=642.96s)]
*  for some of the single antigen vaccines. So in fact, the need for a booster is dependent on a [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=648.24s)]
*  number of factors. And this has to do with the nature of the pathogens involved, the type of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=654.4s)]
*  vaccine platform that we are using, the immune response elicited by the initial doses, the so-called [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=659.12s)]
*  primary series of the vaccine, and then also the duration of the protection and comfort. Again, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=664.4s)]
*  just to give you some examples, the need for boosters in combination vaccines is not new. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not a new topic. So before I was referring to the combination vaccine that targets diphtheria, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=674.08s)]
*  tetanus and pertussis. So for those listeners who may have young children, they may be familiar [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=679.76s)]
*  with this vaccine because actually their kids had to take several doses of it when they were [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=686.0s)]
*  during infancy and early childhood. But actually this vaccine requires a booster [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  during adolescence. And even in adult age, for instance, pregnant women will need to take a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=695.44s)]
*  booster to protect the new infants from pertussis. Or another example could be the hepatitis A and B [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=700.8s)]
*  combination vaccines. Again, this vaccine in particular, for instance, requires a booster [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=706.8s)]
*  when given to patients who have an immunocompromised condition. So again, it's something that is not new. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=711.68s)]
*  The point I would like to make here is that actually newer technologies such as the mRNA [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  technology, as you were bringing up in the question, could actually be very helpful also [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=722.4s)]
*  in this context because all the flexibility, all the adaptability that they bring that can actually [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=728.0s)]
*  be applied to the development of boosters. And to the example that you were using, this has been [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=733.04s)]
*  shown to be very much the case with the adaptation of the vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine to the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=738.48s)]
*  different variants that have been coming up. So I think in any case, what's important to keep in mind [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=744.48s)]
*  is that public health authorities and clinical developers are the ones who are continuously [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=749.84s)]
*  assessing the potential need for a booster. And they do that based on scientific evidence, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=755.12s)]
*  as well as on epidemiological data. So no one should take any decision, I would say, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=759.6s)]
*  individually for a booster vaccine. Again, that is really the call of public health authorities. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  Are there many companies that are working on this kind of technology? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=770.0s)]
*  I would say pretty much any company who plays in the field of vaccines is actually working on [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=774.72s)]
*  developing one or more combination vaccines. I would like perhaps to bring it back to mRNA [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=779.68s)]
*  technology because again, as I said before, this is one technology that really has a lot of potential [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=785.68s)]
*  and can be instrumental in the development of combination vaccines. So at Moderna, for instance, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=791.92s)]
*  we do have actually a number of projects underway looking at combination vaccines. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=797.92s)]
*  The most advanced one is actually looking at a combination of influenza and SARS-CoV-2, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=801.92s)]
*  but we actually have different programs looking at different combinations of other respiratory [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=808.24s)]
*  viruses, including the two that I just mentioned, but also, for instance, respiratory syncytial virus, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=812.4s)]
*  also known as RSV, and human metanemovirus, also known as HMPV. Our colleagues from BioNTech are [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=818.08s)]
*  also working on a combination vaccine targeting influenza and SARS-CoV-2. I'm sure we're going [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=825.52s)]
*  to see lots of good news in this space coming from different companies in the years to come. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=830.96s)]
*  Okay. In the news just recently, we've heard about the declaration just this week of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  M-Pox as being a major issue, and before that we were talking about potentially bird flu making [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=842.96s)]
*  its way into the general population. How easy is it to add a new vaccine into this kind of technology? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=851.12s)]
*  It's not easy, but it doesn't mean it cannot be done, and it doesn't mean it's not a priority [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  for all us working in the development of new vaccines. I'd like to perhaps spend a bit of time [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=864.24s)]
*  talking about avian flu because I really think there is a major concern, I would say, around that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  one in particular. As you know, in the news it's been quite present in the last few months, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=876.32s)]
*  particularly because of some cases where the virus was able to jump from mammals to humans. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=882.0s)]
*  In fact, avian flu viruses have been recognized as a threat to human health for decades. Back [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=888.4s)]
*  since the late 1990s, early 2000s, when there were some H5N1 outbreaks, that concern has been [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=893.52s)]
*  there. In fact, that is the reason why many companies have actually been putting a lot of [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=900.96s)]
*  work, not only companies, also academic research groups have been putting a lot of attention to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=905.04s)]
*  this particular virus, and specifically a couple of streams which are highly pathogenic such as [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=909.04s)]
*  5HN1, which I already mentioned, but then also H7N9, which is an ongoing focus of research. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=915.36s)]
*  Fortunately, there have already been a few inactivated adjuvanted vaccines developed [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=922.88s)]
*  against H5N1, which have allowed for the basis of some emergency stockpiles, but the reality is that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=927.12s)]
*  we need to be better prepared for a potential pandemic, and that is a real threat. In that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=934.32s)]
*  sense, the different technologies that I was talking about are also being applied to such [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=940.16s)]
*  research. Now, coming to mRNA technology, there is a sentiment that it can actually be very [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=944.96s)]
*  instrumental, and I would say there are two reasons why this is the case. Number one is the [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=950.48s)]
*  virus variability. Avian flu viruses actually mutate very rapidly. That is one of the characteristics [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=955.12s)]
*  they have. So having a technology that gives you the flexibility to essentially adapt the sequence [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=960.88s)]
*  that you need to target, that is very important because it allows you to keep up with the pace of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=968.4s)]
*  mutation of that virus. And again, we have seen that proven to be the case in the pandemic, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=972.72s)]
*  in the COVID-19 pandemic. The other aspect is that because mRNA technology does not depend on [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=977.28s)]
*  biological systems for production, it can be very easily scalable, and this is also a very important [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  feature, particularly when you think of a pandemic potential risk. So in fact, we do have a program [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  right now, it's in phase two clinical testing, a program to evaluate a vaccine candidate against [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=997.04s)]
*  the prevention of pandemic influenza. We are really encouraged, and in fact, just as a testimony [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1002.0s)]
*  to how much attention there is to the potential of this technology for this particular infection, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1007.44s)]
*  this program is actually receiving partial funding by BARDA. So I think that's just an example of how [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1013.28s)]
*  important the potential can be. Another aspect that could come into the discussion is once we [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1020.0s)]
*  have such vaccines available against Avian flu, how do we manage them? So you were talking about [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1026.08s)]
*  the vaccination calendar, how do we fit them in? This is actually a very complex discussion, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1031.52s)]
*  there's many, or decision, there's actually many factors that play. I don't think there's probably [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1036.1599999999999s)]
*  at this point in time, a need to think that they should be part of the routine calendar [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1041.6s)]
*  vaccination, but perhaps a more targeted approach, focused more on protecting the higher [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  risk groups and also enhancing pandemic preparedness and surveillance. That may be more [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1051.2s)]
*  practical and cost effective. And in that sense, it may be perhaps a better approach [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1056.88s)]
*  right now to think of how we would manage the threat of Avian flu. How practical is it to add [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1061.2s)]
*  vaccines to a combination vaccine? I mean, is there a limit to the number that you could include? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  I know we were talking about two or three, but could you do four or five in the same vaccination? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1076.64s)]
*  It's always difficult to talk about limits when you discuss technology and science, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1083.76s)]
*  because the reality is that with time and advancements, typically the limits can be [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1087.04s)]
*  pushed further. So when it comes to combination vaccines, we've been exploring up to three [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1092.16s)]
*  different pathogens in one vaccine. But for instance, if you take the example of another [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  vaccine, which I didn't talk about, but which we are developing, which is the, we are developing [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1101.92s)]
*  a vaccine against Cytomegalovirus, which is a virus that can actually produce congenital [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1106.48s)]
*  malformations if the mom is infected when she's pregnant. In that particular one, we've been able [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1112.32s)]
*  to actually combine in one vaccine, six different antigens. Again, I'm pretty sure that over time, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  we'll see more advancements also in this space. And while probably now two, three seem to be the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1125.6s)]
*  more reasonable number to go with, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more. And in fact, there are [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  some examples in the market, in the pediatric vaccination scheme, where you actually see [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1136.72s)]
*  more than several vaccines combined. Obviously, testing is massively important with all of this, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  but how easy is it to change or update a combination vaccine? For example, when, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1149.84s)]
*  as you mentioned, with some of the fast mutating viruses, I know we had all of the different COVID [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1157.2s)]
*  variants. If we take the example of the mRNA vaccines, this can actually be a very straightforward [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1163.12s)]
*  process. And again, we've seen it already in play a number of times for the COVID-19 vaccines, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1168.32s)]
*  more recently, the adaptation of these vaccines to the JN1 lineages has been [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1173.28s)]
*  commanded by regulatory agencies. Essentially, once you know the genetic sequence of the new variants, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1178.8s)]
*  you just need to synthesize the corresponding mRNA sequence. This is something that is supported by [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1184.48s)]
*  great technological advancements also in the IT space, but essentially this process can just [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1191.36s)]
*  take place within a few weeks. Then you may need to do some testing. It could be only for clinical, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1196.16s)]
*  there could be a need for also clinical trials, which could take also perhaps a few months. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1202.0s)]
*  And this would depend obviously on regulatory requirements. But I think the very important [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1207.0400000000002s)]
*  element here is that even though you need to adapt the sequences I was describing, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1210.96s)]
*  the production process essentially does not really get impacted by the need of major modifications. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1215.8400000000001s)]
*  Altogether, this really allows that within a matter of a few months, you can actually update [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1221.76s)]
*  a vaccine. And you could do it for a single antigen or you could do it for different antigens, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  depending on what the need is. And then obviously the synthetic nature of the mRNA production [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1231.12s)]
*  allows also for a very rapid scale up based on the global needs. So again, I think this seems to be, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1235.84s)]
*  at least for the mRNA technology, this could be a very straightforward process. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1242.08s)]
*  What do you see as the future for combination vaccines? It seems like it's a very, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1246.16s)]
*  not only an exciting area, but also a very fast developing one. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1250.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the future of combination vaccines is definitely looking very promising. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1255.68s)]
*  Again, I think all these advances that I was discussing before in immunology, in biotechnology, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1260.0s)]
*  also how public health strategies are being shaped to incorporate these vaccines more effectively, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1265.92s)]
*  I think this all offers a lot of, I would say, potential for significant impact. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1271.6s)]
*  But let me perhaps now talk a bit more about one aspect I didn't touch so much about before. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  We've been talking about the technological advancements, but I think one element which [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1281.36s)]
*  is also of critical importance is how quickly this can happen. Classically, when you think of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  development of combination vaccines, that typically spans 10, 15 years, from initial research to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1290.8s)]
*  regulatory approval and full deployment of the vaccine. Coming back to the mRNA technology, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1297.44s)]
*  I think for the reasons I've been mentioning, I think that technology has the potential to really [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  deliver on much shorter timelines. It's about the flexibility that it offers, the adaptability, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1309.52s)]
*  the possibility to rapidly design and upscale production capabilities. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1314.96s)]
*  So I think in that sense, we're going to see not only newer vaccines, more effective vaccines, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1319.8400000000001s)]
*  hopefully as well, but also faster development of, and I think that's actually something that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1325.84s)]
*  really makes this feel particularly exciting and makes me feel very passionate about it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1330.72s)]
*  What I think is important to note is that we will need to continue to invest in research, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1336.08s)]
*  infrastructure, and also in international collaboration will be very important to make [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1340.08s)]
*  sure that recommendations and implementation is aligned across different countries to make it [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  more effective. In terms of rollout of some of the things that you and other companies are working [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1348.8s)]
*  on, what kind of timelines are we looking at for some of those? If I look into our pipeline, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1355.28s)]
*  which is what I know best, and I would like to perhaps focus on, just to be fair, not to make [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1361.36s)]
*  comments on other companies' pipelines, but I do think we're going to be able to see some really [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1366.3999999999999s)]
*  good additions to the vaccine armamentarium within a couple of years in many cases, and then we'll [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1371.6s)]
*  see more to come. So again, I think it's going to get very, very exciting and interesting. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1377.44s)]
*  And I do think the way we think of combination vaccines, which historically has been very much [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1381.84s)]
*  confined to the pediatric space, is going to change, and we're going to be able to offer [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1387.52s)]
*  such solutions to other population segments also at risk of infections. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1392.24s)]
*  Is there anything else that you wanted to highlight that we didn't talk about? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1397.28s)]
*  To me, what's very important is to leave this message that again, we're living very exciting [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1401.68s)]
*  times when it comes to the development of combination vaccines, and I do think the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1405.76s)]
*  broader availability of such vaccines, the newer technologies that are becoming available to all of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1410.24s)]
*  us, I think that's really going to help us improve the perspectives and to improve essentially the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1415.04s)]
*  global health outcomes of vaccination, which is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1421.6s)]
*  you can think of when it comes to public health. So again, I think we're living really exciting [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1427.04s)]
*  times, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing those innovations come into creation. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1430.88s)]
*  A fascinating subject and definitely one that's risen in prominence since COVID, and of course [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1440.88s)]
*  there are plenty of other potential pandemics lurking out there, so vaccines will always be [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1447.44s)]
*  relevant to stay ahead of the curve. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_lz5s3kaM&t=1453.76s)]
