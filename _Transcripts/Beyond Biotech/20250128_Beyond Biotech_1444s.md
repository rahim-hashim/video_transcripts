Video Description: Immunology is a key area in biotech and biopharma, both in terms of R&D and sales.


However, according to UK-headquartered Greywolf Therapeutics, the industry has only focused on two-thirds of the puzzle.


To have an immunological effect, you must activate the body’s T cells, which cells requires a chain of three key signals. The first is antigen recognition, i.e. the initial detection of a cell by a T-cell. The second is the co-stimulation of non-antigen presenting molecules, which enhances the immune response​. The final step is cytokine-mediated differentiation and expansion, which guides how T-cells target threats. ​


Companies have focused on the second two signals, with signal 2 most commonly seen in therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Signal 3, on the other hand, can be primarily seen in therapies for autoimmune disorders, such as anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors.


Greywolf Therapeutics is the first company to explore changing signal 1. The company says focusing on signal 1 applies in three key therapeutic areas: oncology, autoimmunity and virology. 


Greywolf’s first candidate has delivered strong results during its ongoing phase I/II trial in oncology, therefore demonstrating proof-of-mechanism and target engagement, with its next candidate well-progressed in preclinical development in autoimmunity.


To tell us more about the company and its work is Pete Joyce, CEO and co-founder of Greywolf Therapeutics.

# Could antigen modulation address autoimmune diseases?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 120. I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. This week we're looking at the question could antigen [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  modulation address autoimmune diseases? Immunology is definitely big both in terms of R&D and sales [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=24.7s)]
*  but according to the company Grey Wolf Therapeutics we've only focused on two-thirds of the puzzle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=33.46s)]
*  To have an effect the body's T cells need to be activated and that needs three key signals, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  antigen recognition, co-stimulation of non-antigen presenting molecules and cytokine mediated [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=48.940000000000005s)]
*  differentiation and expansion. Companies have pretty much to date focused on the second two [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=57.1s)]
*  signals but Grey Wolf Therapeutics is exploring changing signal one. To tell us more is Pete [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=64.38s)]
*  Joyce the CEO and co-founder of Grey Wolf Therapeutics. Okay so I guess to get things [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=73.06s)]
*  started I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit of background on the company. Yeah [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=81.1s)]
*  very happy to Jim so we started the company myself and Tom McCarthy in 2017. The founding [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=85.74s)]
*  premise really of what it is we're doing or the technology that we're doing is really all centered [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=93.34s)]
*  on how do we manipulate that initial detection event of the immune system with the target cell [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=98.26s)]
*  because this detection event by the immune system where it can recognize a foreign agent or indeed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  can recognize erroneous cells such as cancer is kind of fundamental to the kind of chain reaction [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=110.34s)]
*  that then happens in immune cell biology and so it's pivotal in disease and the tack we've [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  taken really is all around how do we manipulate that detection event that and what's called [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=122.9s)]
*  antigen presentation, antigen modulation and so we essentially target a set of enzymes that can [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=127.42s)]
*  modulate the antigen repertoire of cells and that's really exciting in cancer because what it can do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=133.74s)]
*  is essentially shift or lead to the detection of cancer in a state where prior the cancer has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=139.02s)]
*  actually not been visible to the immune system so the new antigens that get created through our [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=145.54s)]
*  technology can then stimulate a novel immune response and then be to the attack of the cancer. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=150.02s)]
*  On the flip side in autoimmunity the immune system in that situation is obviously detecting cells, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=154.94s)]
*  it shouldn't be detecting parts of the body, it shouldn't be detecting that's what's leading to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  the attack of self and our antigen modulation technology by blocking these enzymes we call [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=163.34s)]
*  ERAP1 and ERAP2 really are around trying to turn off that activation because we shift what is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  presented to the immune system we can actually turn off that cross reactivity and as you can [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=174.5s)]
*  well imagine this type of technology can also have applications in neurology so that's the kind of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  core tech and then if I just touch on where we are as a company so as I say founded in 2017 [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=183.94s)]
*  did our initial series A in 2018 and we did a series B which we recently expanded actually [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=190.98s)]
*  so the initial series B was beginning of 2023 and then we expanded that later this year. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=197.06s)]
*  So we're now in phase one slash two for our oncology program which is really exciting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=202.02s)]
*  because this is a completely novel area of therapeutic biology that we're addressing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=207.22s)]
*  aiming to go into expansion cohorts next year into specific indications and start to understand [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=211.86s)]
*  the impact on patients. Our second program is in autoimmunity and that should be entering the clinic [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  at some point next year that's all around trying to turn off that kind of initial to causative [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=223.78s)]
*  event in autoimmunity so turning off that cross reactivity of the immune system itself and then [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=228.74s)]
*  we've got two earlier stage programs that are pre-clinical which are all are all centered on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  different ways of manipulating that immune recognition and the antigen modulation but [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=238.82s)]
*  essentially trying at the core trying to tackle that initial immune dysfunction that can happen [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  in cancer which immunity and potentially also occurs in neurology. Where did the name come from [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=247.7s)]
*  because a lot of names have kind of pathways or a scientific slant to them? Yeah actually when we [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=253.62s)]
*  were naming the company I purposely wanted to name it not through a scientific guise that was partly [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=261.3s)]
*  through memorability and recognition and then so the name actually comes from a mayfly mimic so [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=266.34s)]
*  once upon a time when I had more time I used to do a bit of fly fishing the gray wolf is a type of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=273.06s)]
*  mayfly mimic and actually a bit of a lucky charm I seem to only ever catch fish when I use that so [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=277.85999999999996s)]
*  I thought well let's name the company after a good luck omen so that's where the name comes from so [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  yeah nothing to do with oncology or to immunity or virology. Could you perhaps go through the three [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=287.62s)]
*  steps or phases of the mechanics of immunology activating T cells? Yeah absolutely so what the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=292.98s)]
*  textbooks will tell you is that the immune system requires three signals to become activated so that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  first signal is that detection event so that's the signal we're manipulating through our antigen [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=305.62s)]
*  modulation technology by blocking these enzymes we call erap1 and erap2 and so that requires the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=310.26s)]
*  immune system to detect something different on this presented on the surface of a cell [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=315.62s)]
*  through what's called the MHC class 1 antigen presentation complex and that's where it's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=320.74s)]
*  detecting potentially peptides derived from viruses or mutated peptides because of the cancer or indeed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=324.66s)]
*  in context of autoimmunity signals that in essence it shouldn't be detecting so that's signal one [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=331.38s)]
*  signal two is called co-stimulation that in essence is there to ratify that that signal one is correct [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=336.66s)]
*  so it's a kind of a fail-safe mechanism without that co-stimulation there won't be an immunological [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=342.82s)]
*  response so you kind of need the two things to happen in parallel and so that's where immune [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=348.34s)]
*  checkpoint inhibitors work in the context of cancer immunotherapy they're all trying to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  manipulate that co-stimulatory event because as well as co-stimulation there's co-inhibition [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  of that type of signal to kind of control the balance of the potent immune system and then [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  signal three is cytokine release and that's really there to turbocharge immunological response one [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=365.78s)]
*  signal one and signal two are in place you need signal three to really drive the propagation so [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=372.26s)]
*  in the context of a virus you're really trying to clear out that viral infection so you think of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=377.3s)]
*  things like il2 which is an approved drug in oncology and is also used in a cocktail for a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=382.58s)]
*  number of other therapies to try and you know stimulate and bolster that immunological response [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=387.94s)]
*  so there's clearly been success in signal two in the space of oncology in other areas there's also [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=393.22s)]
*  been success in signal three yet no one is really manipulating or changing signal one which is what [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  we're really about to do because we're trying to change that fundamental immune cell detection [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=403.86s)]
*  event to overcome that kind of initial immune dysfunction. The stages that you mentioned there, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=408.26s)]
*  are there sort of treatment areas that are traditionally associated with each of those [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=414.5s)]
*  three stages? Yeah so in the context of signal one I guess that there are therapies out there [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=420.26s)]
*  that are trying to target pre-existing signal one as it were so those antigens that are presented [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=425.7s)]
*  on the surface of cells as flags to the immune system and so you could think of things like [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=431.78s)]
*  CAR-T therapy in the context of oncology and now potentially being applied in autoimmunity [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=437.05999999999995s)]
*  you could also think about the likes of Immunocor and Adaptimmune that target the MHC class one [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=442.9s)]
*  complex and there's a number of other companies but they're all predicated or even vaccine [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=447.29999999999995s)]
*  therapies are all predicated on going after pre-existing antigens there now the exciting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=451.78s)]
*  thing there is that could potentially stimulate further but then the other side is that that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=456.97999999999996s)]
*  hasn't led to an immune response in the first place or a sufficiently strong enough immune [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=461.3s)]
*  response in the first place. In signal two that co-stimulatory event that's the event that can [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=465.3s)]
*  get manipulated in certain diseases and it's the potent regulator of the immunological response [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=470.18s)]
*  because you have both activating parts of signal two and deactivating part and so if you think of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=475.86s)]
*  drugs like ketruder, pembrolizumab, obdivo with nivolumab these are blocking that anti-PD1 access [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=480.90000000000003s)]
*  which is all part of that kind of signal two paradigm and then signal three as I talked about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=487.7s)]
*  that's the kind of cytokine work so we know in blocking certain cytokines that has huge impact [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=492.58s)]
*  on things like autoimmunity so think of IL-17s or the TNF-alphas but you also in oncology we [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=498.09999999999997s)]
*  know as I mentioned before that things like IL-2 can actually have clear effects and things like [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  melanoma. The initial step which is where you're kind of working and why is that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=510.18s)]
*  step so important and why has it traditionally not been investigated as much when looking for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=517.22s)]
*  treatments? To go to why is it so important I mean it is the fundamental detection event so [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=522.74s)]
*  without this there is no immunological response or put another way if you're able to turn this off [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=528.74s)]
*  then you can turn off the whole immunological response at least on the adaptive side of the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=535.22s)]
*  immune system so it is fundamental so it's really important. The reason as to why probably a couple [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  of reasons one we haven't found a way of safely manipulating this because you are changing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  something quite fundamental in detection we've been pushing the boundary here to see if we can [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=551.0600000000001s)]
*  manipulate these enzymes you're up one or you're up two that that is and can in fact be tolerated [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  we've got a rationale as to why and it's proving to be the case we are seeing through our preclinical [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=560.5s)]
*  studies and now in the clinic. The other reason as well is when an area works in the space of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=565.14s)]
*  therapeutic drug discovery then it tends to attract approaches that are similar but ever so [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=571.14s)]
*  slightly different whereas not always the folks take that kind of look all the way kind of laterally [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=576.9s)]
*  a very different type of approach and that's for good reason because this is a tough [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=583.06s)]
*  tough space to develop novel therapies in and so you try and follow where things potentially have [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=587.62s)]
*  worked before to increase your likelihood of success but our view is you really need to do [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=592.74s)]
*  something quite fundamentally different to either try and turn off autoimmune disease or to drive [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=597.14s)]
*  responses in oncology which is why we've centered on manipulating that detection event that signal [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=602.34s)]
*  one. You mentioned oncology are there other areas of disease that this is applicable to? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=607.78s)]
*  Yes so the oncology is where we started and that's where our most advanced program is is currently [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=616.02s)]
*  but as I mentioned earlier we've got an autoimmunity program which is also targeting [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=622.9s)]
*  the same enzyme as is in our oncology program but we're dosing differently we're trying to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=628.42s)]
*  essentially turn off that immune response because there's very clear data that this particular [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=632.26s)]
*  enzyme ERAP1 is actually responsible for producing the targets on the surface of normal cells that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=638.02s)]
*  are causing the immune system to cross-react so if we can turn off our enzyme we can stop those [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=644.5s)]
*  targets being presented and we can turn off the immune response at source and so definite [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=649.94s)]
*  applications in a number of autoimmune diseases which we're really quite excited about and our [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=655.0600000000001s)]
*  recent funding now allows us to explore that in more detail and then in virology there's a very [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=659.54s)]
*  clear application akin to oncology this is about in virology you know think of examples where [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=665.14s)]
*  unfortunately patients have been unable to clear a chronic infection so hepatitis b as an example [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=671.14s)]
*  in that instance you're trying to stimulate a new immune response and we think this could be a way [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=678.1s)]
*  of doing that because you can provide new antigens to the immune system that can then drive that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=682.1s)]
*  response. Could you tell us a little bit more about inhibiting ERAP? Yeah so those are targets of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=686.98s)]
*  interest and that's what the company has been focused on trying to develop therapies to inhibit [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=693.3s)]
*  so these are the enzymes that are remember members we call them ERAP1 and ERAP2 for short [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=697.22s)]
*  that members of the antigen presentation pathway in essence they're trimming enzyme which means [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=703.3s)]
*  they take off amino acids from peptides that are then shuttled through this pathway to be presented [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=707.9399999999999s)]
*  at the cell surface to the immune system and be seen as either self or non-self. There are a [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=714.42s)]
*  mechanism that we can essentially manipulate and tweak that ultimately leads to a difference up at [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=720.42s)]
*  the cell surface and we can do that with small molecule inhibitors and our inhibitors bind [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=725.78s)]
*  allosteric sites in the enzyme that in essence can then turn off the enzyme's activity and then [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=731.78s)]
*  change what is presented at the surface of the cell. Moving from that to the work that you're [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=736.9s)]
*  doing could you tell me about your candidate what it is and how it works and how it would be [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=741.4599999999999s)]
*  administered? Yeah absolutely so we've got two candidate molecules now both of which are inhibitors [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=746.9s)]
*  of ERAP1 and so they're differentiated in terms of their overall properties. Our candidate in [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=753.54s)]
*  oncology that is coming to the end of phase one is called GRWD5769 it's an oral small molecule [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=759.46s)]
*  so patients take this drug twice a day at the moment it's part of a clinical trial. We're about [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=767.38s)]
*  to enter phase 1b or phase 2a early next year which is where we get to start to explore specific [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=772.02s)]
*  cancer indications in patients. Our second program also as I said an inhibitor of ERAP1 we call that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=779.38s)]
*  GRWD0715 and that is currently going through the latter stages of pre-clinical development [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=785.86s)]
*  with a view that we will enter into autoimmunity and specifically into a disease called axial [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=792.82s)]
*  spondyloarthritis which is in essence where the immune system starts to attack the joints within [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  the back so the sacroiliac joints within the back as well as potentially other parts of the body. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=802.9s)]
*  And so that molecule is in essence is trying to turn off that initial [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=808.34s)]
*  detection event of the immune system so to turn off the immune response at source. So those are [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=812.58s)]
*  the two candidates and I said we've got two earlier stage programs one targeting the enzyme ERAP2 [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=818.0200000000001s)]
*  which is essentially the sister enzyme of ERAP1. When we block that enzyme we change the antigen [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=823.22s)]
*  repertoire in a different way and then we've got a fourth program which is really trying to target [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=828.26s)]
*  some of those changes that we drive at the cell surface that might allow us to treat particularly [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=832.82s)]
*  tough to treat cancers as well as even have applications in virology. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=836.9s)]
*  And how would this treatment be an advance on current treatments or would it be something [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=841.4599999999999s)]
*  that you use in conjunction with other treatments? So in the context if I go to autoimmunity first [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=847.54s)]
*  we see this really as something because it's going at the source of disease the cause of disease [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=853.4599999999999s)]
*  we see this essentially starting to work in patients where we haven't seen responses or [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=859.54s)]
*  unfortunately the patients have either responded to the current standard of care such as the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=864.5s)]
*  anti-TNF molecules but have then relapsed and not seen any benefit. And so yeah there's a lot of [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=870.02s)]
*  patients unfortunately either don't respond or if they do respond then they relapse and we think [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=876.02s)]
*  this is where this therapy could be particularly be effective. In the context of oncology because [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=879.7s)]
*  of the treatment paradigm in oncology we are actually going in combination with an anti-PD1 [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=885.38s)]
*  agent simitlumab. The aim there is we're combining something that manipulates signal 1 in our ERAP1 [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=890.74s)]
*  inhibitor is something that works on signal 2 so completely orthogonal or differentiated and as a [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=897.7s)]
*  result we can either increase the durability of response in patients or even start to see responses [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=904.42s)]
*  in patients where we haven't seen responses before. What does this mean for patients? What are you [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  anticipating means success? Yeah so success in oncology would be increasing the durability [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=914.7399999999999s)]
*  of response. We see the ability to shrink their tumors and ultimately see longer outcomes for [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=923.14s)]
*  those patients and then potentially in the future we might even see those patients unfortunately [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=929.38s)]
*  that aren't responding to any current therapy we can actually lead to response in those patients [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=934.9s)]
*  which obviously would have an impact on their overall disease outcomes. In the context of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=940.1s)]
*  autoimmunity the idea is to put these patients into remission really so they no longer have [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=946.02s)]
*  all of the horrible symptoms that come as a result of the immune system attacking the body [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=951.62s)]
*  so we alleviate all of that damage and we essentially turn it off so in theory the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=956.5s)]
*  idea is these patients become significantly symptom free. Does the stage at which a disease is at make [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=961.14s)]
*  any difference to the treatment? In oncology I mean yes it does because unfortunately if you're [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=969.3s)]
*  in very late stage patients those patients have had a number of other therapies and obviously [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=974.9s)]
*  their overall fitness has been impacted and particularly their immune fitness has been [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=979.54s)]
*  impacted so we're being careful about thinking about what is the stage at which we want to see [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=984.42s)]
*  where we could have the most benefit here and that will undoubtedly mean that we want the patient's [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=989.78s)]
*  immune system to be of sufficient health that they can the immune system can detect the type [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=994.26s)]
*  of antigen modulation that we're driving so that would be the objective in oncology. In the context [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=999.14s)]
*  of autoimmunity we actually think this could work very early in the treatment paradigm so patients [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1005.06s)]
*  typically have non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and we could see this coming as an oral therapy [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1010.5s)]
*  coming straight after that so very early in disease and actually nipping the disease in the bud. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  There is also a very clear rationale unfortunately if the patient does progress through [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1020.66s)]
*  the various biologic therapies that we could move the patient onto this drug after that because in [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1024.98s)]
*  theory the immune response is still happening and we have the ability to turn it off so we [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1030.58s)]
*  hypothesize that it could work in both areas at least in the context of autoimmunity. Is there a [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1035.46s)]
*  lot of research being done in antigen modulation and are there other companies involved in this [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1040.18s)]
*  kind of work? Yeah so we do know that there's interest in this whole kind of paradigm of how [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1046.26s)]
*  do you manipulate this signal one this immune cell detection we do seem to be the ones blazing the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1051.38s)]
*  trail here at least three to four years ahead of any of the potential competitors either biotech or [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1057.54s)]
*  pharma but you know I think you know that's an exciting opportunity for us to really uncover [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1063.54s)]
*  and understand the biology in much greater detail whether it be an oncology and or in [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1068.66s)]
*  in autoimmunity but there is no doubt there's a lot of work going on in this space actually [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1072.74s)]
*  some of the original academic work in that presentation came really from the UK and in [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1077.46s)]
*  Oxford and Cambridge and other places but yeah we seem to be leading the way although there's [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1082.26s)]
*  definitely earlier stage interest in earlier programs. Has that led to interest in terms of [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1086.9s)]
*  investments and partnerships for you? Yes absolutely so yeah we are currently in the process of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1092.66s)]
*  exploring and potential partners on our earlier stage programs and you know we maintain a constant [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1098.34s)]
*  dialogue with the investment community and pharma community with regard to what we're doing and I [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1103.62s)]
*  think it is fair to say there's a fair amount of excitement as to what we're doing so the novelty [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1108.02s)]
*  is hugely exciting because of you know it is backed up by fundamental human biology that you [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1113.22s)]
*  know is fundamental to an immune response I guess to be candid the challenge can always be when [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1118.58s)]
*  you're in a completely new space like that you've got to do the hard work and show whether or not [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1123.3s)]
*  this has potential as opposed to being a fast follower in another area and that's hugely exciting [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1127.86s)]
*  and motivating for all of us as a team because we think this biology has huge potential then it's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1133.9399999999998s)]
*  kind of convincing others of that potential as well. I guess it's two sides of a coin one is that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1138.82s)]
*  you're in an area that nobody else is which is an advantage but as you said by being in a field that [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1145.06s)]
*  nobody else has quite done before there's not necessarily skepticism but you kind of have to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1151.3799999999999s)]
*  prove that what you're doing is going to be valuable. Yeah you have to do the work and you [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1157.22s)]
*  do the hard biology and as we think about that in the clinic it means are we really testing our [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1161.94s)]
*  hypothesis have we got the mark the biomarkers there to be able to show that we're blocking and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1167.22s)]
*  manipulating this mechanism which we had to develop all from scratch but now in a great place to be [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1171.14s)]
*  able to do it and then for external folks when you're in such a new space it's hard for them to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1176.26s)]
*  calibrate risk right so that part of educating and all of the work we do in terms of understanding [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1180.82s)]
*  the biology. You mentioned some of the other things in your pipeline already so what are the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1185.94s)]
*  next steps for you moving forward is it to concentrate on the things that you have or are [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1191.46s)]
*  you still developing other treatments? Yeah two parts so I mean we just closed additional financing [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1196.8200000000002s)]
*  which took up series B close to 100 million US that allows us to push those two more advanced [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1203.46s)]
*  programs the one in the clinic and the one that's close to the clinic but we do think there's real [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1208.9s)]
*  value in the earlier stage programs we have so the plan is to advance our ERAP2 program which [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1213.86s)]
*  is in pre-clinical at the moment as well as the program we call the MHC directed therapies which [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1218.58s)]
*  is how do we can we start to tackle tougher even tougher to treat cancers or even things like [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  chronic viral infection so we are focused yeah moving the clinical programs forward but we are [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1227.78s)]
*  continuing to move the underlying biology because that can also impact our lead programs in terms [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1233.06s)]
*  of understanding how these mechanisms work and can be applied. So what's the kind of obviously [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1238.1s)]
*  you can't be exact but what's the timeline moving forward? Yeah so the recent financing we did funds [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1244.34s)]
*  us all the way through to the end of 26 our oncology study will run so our phase 1b or phase 2a [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1250.4199999999998s)]
*  will run through 2025 and first half of 2026 that will give us a really good indication of [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1256.34s)]
*  how it's potentially working in patients our autoimmunity program will run through phase one [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1262.58s)]
*  and then the aim is to bring one of our earlier stage programs onto the cusp of being ready to [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1268.58s)]
*  move into the clinic by 2026. Do you think that the work that you're doing will lead to greater [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1272.74s)]
*  industry interest? Do you anticipate more people getting into this stage one field? Yes I think [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1280.02s)]
*  either by manipulating these enzymes or potentially there might be one or two other kind of targets of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1287.54s)]
*  interest in this space. I think if we're able to demonstrate the impact of this across the three [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1293.46s)]
*  at least you know one of the three therapeutic areas where we think it could have application [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1298.98s)]
*  I think it could be more than one of the three then it will garner significant interest to be [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1302.98s)]
*  fair already is amongst those communities so yeah I guess watch this space and see how we progress [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1308.02s)]
*  over the next one to two years. Do you go to a lot of events to talk about your work with it being so [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1313.46s)]
*  different? Yeah we do yeah we go to a lot of the key research we actually presented our initial [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1320.58s)]
*  clinical data in oncology at ASCO earlier this year that was in May in Chicago and we go to various [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1326.74s)]
*  other major cancer conferences such as ESMO and AACR and then on the autoimmunity side yeah we go [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1332.58s)]
*  to the key kind of rheumatology or translational autoimmunity conferences there so yeah we talk [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1338.34s)]
*  about the science we've been you know we're invited to present and then on more on the kind [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1343.78s)]
*  of business or corporate side of things we obviously go to the kind of major events there to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1347.78s)]
*  educate the investment community and pharma community as well as to what we're doing. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1352.1s)]
*  That must be interesting given that it's such a new area what's the reaction like when you give [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1356.42s)]
*  presentations a lot of interest? Yeah there is a lot of interest it's been what interesting to watch [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1362.58s)]
*  the kind of journey of that over the last six seven years I think initially it was an interesting [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1367.54s)]
*  idea but I'm not sure you'll be able to do that or you're right is it going to be safe are you [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1374.42s)]
*  going to be able to lead to the types of effects you would expect based on what was previously seen [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1379.0600000000002s)]
*  in the literature but as we've kind of continued to progress forward I think it's fair to say the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1383.3000000000002s)]
*  excitement in the space is really ramped up across a number of areas and that's been really exciting [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1388.1000000000001s)]
*  to see and we get great input and feedback on what we're doing but also on and how we can [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  continue thinking about applying it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1398.74s)]
*  It's always interesting to find out about companies doing things differently [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1405.06s)]
*  and I'd say Grey Wolf Therapeutics is definitely one to watch in the future. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1409.6200000000001s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu and I hope wherever [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1415.14s)]
*  in the world you are you have a great week ahead thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DBLsOLuCkE&t=1422.26s)]
