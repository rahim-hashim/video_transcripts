# Gene editing in the microbiome to treat acne
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 77 and it's the first of 2024. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=0.0s)]
*  But I'm sure I'm not the first to wish you a Happy New Year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=17.92s)]
*  The holiday season definitely just flew by. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=21.36s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the weekly LaBioTech podcast. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=24.44s)]
*  And to kick things off this year, we're taking a look at a potential new treatment using [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=28.64s)]
*  gene editing of the microbiome to tackle acne. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=33.52s)]
*  Xavier Duportet, CEO of Eligo Bioscience, is our guest this week and we covered a lot [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=37.16s)]
*  of ground on gene editing and the microbiome. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=44.04s)]
*  But of course, first, it's an opportunity to ask about the company and its origins. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=47.68s)]
*  So basically Eligo was founded based on an invention we made at Rockefeller University [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=53.16s)]
*  and MIT together when I was doing my PhD with on the MIT side, Tim Lu, Professor Tim Lu, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=59.28s)]
*  and on the Rockefeller side, Professor Luciano Maraffini is one of the inventors of CRISPR, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=65.72s)]
*  one of the co-founders of Intelliatherapeutics, and David Bicar was a postdoc there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=70.52s)]
*  So when was when everybody, well, not everyone, but the ones working on CRISPR and the applications [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=76.0s)]
*  of CRISPR were mostly focused on how to use CRISPR in a chaotic cells. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=83.96s)]
*  We actually took the tangent and found out that if you physically use CRISPR, deliver [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=88.72s)]
*  CRISPR in bacteria and target the nucleus to create double strain break in the chromosome [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=96.36s)]
*  of the bacteria, since prokaryotic cells do not have the same machinery to repair double [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=102.2s)]
*  strain breaks, it actually kills the bacteria. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=107.08s)]
*  They don't, they have very inefficiently repaired the double strain break and so it can kill [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=110.0s)]
*  the bacteria. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=114.04s)]
*  And so when we saw that, this is when we had basically the idea that this new mechanism [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=115.04s)]
*  of action could be used in the real world as a potential highly precise antimicrobial [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=124.72s)]
*  mechanism of action. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=131.52s)]
*  And so this is basically how Eligot was started. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  We published two papers, Nature Biotech, and filed some quite important IP and then decided [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=136.56s)]
*  to translate this invention, this academic invention into a biotech to create drugs to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=144.08s)]
*  solve real and met needs and address diseases that were caused by specific bacteria in the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=150.96s)]
*  microbiome that were associated to a number of different diseases. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=157.2s)]
*  I guess you said that you're creating a new class of transformative genetic medicines. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  I wonder if you could explain how that differs from current techniques. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=166.88s)]
*  Yeah, so basically I think most of the genetic medicines today are focusing on correcting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=170.92s)]
*  or adding genes into eukaryotic cells. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  And so we are basically one of the only companies in the world that are developing genetic medicines [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=181.96s)]
*  to edit the genetic makeup of the microbiome. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=188.84s)]
*  So we've basically found a way to deliver genetic cargos to bacteria in vivo, so in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  patients. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=202.16s)]
*  And for this, we're leveraging viruses, not the typical viruses that used to target human [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=203.68s)]
*  cells, eukaryotic cells, but viruses that are natural predators of bacteriophages. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=209.92s)]
*  And so as opposed to all the bacteriophage startups and companies, we are basically leveraging [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  only the delivery capacity of the bacteriophage. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=224.28s)]
*  So we're just using the shell of the virus. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  We remove all its natural genetic components, so the genetic code of the virus, and instead [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  we package in the shell of the virus a completely synthetic DNA payload. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=236.16s)]
*  So once we have this viral particle that contains our synthetic DNA payload, we use it to deliver [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=241.0s)]
*  the payload in specific bacterial populations of the microbiome. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=247.16s)]
*  And the payload itself is really modular in terms of what we can encode in the payload. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  And so at Eligo right now, while we started by encoding in this payload CRISPR-Cas system, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=258.0s)]
*  so the nuclease and the guide RNAs, now we have also demonstrated that we can package [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=263.76s)]
*  base editors that we use to not kill bacteria in the microbiome, but instead edit their [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=270.4s)]
*  genome. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=278.4s)]
*  So whether it is to modify one base there in a protein to inactivate the catalytic site [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=279.4s)]
*  of an enzyme, whether it is to modify a promoter to either increase or lower the production [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=285.88s)]
*  of a molecule from this bacteria in the body. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=293.44s)]
*  The advantage of using base editor compared to using CRISPR is that we will not kill the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=296.28s)]
*  bacteria, we will stably mutate these bacteria. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=301.64s)]
*  So this can be useful for a number of applications where the bacteria associated in driving the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=305.56s)]
*  disease is a commensal that cannot be eradicated from the microbiome, and you just want to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  modify how it functions in the microbiome. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=316.52s)]
*  The third type of payload that we're delivering is a payload that will enable the local expression [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=318.8s)]
*  of a molecule in the microbiome. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=325.36s)]
*  So really it's about adding new genes to the microbiome. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=327.44s)]
*  So we're delivering one or multiple genes on a plasmatic form in the microbiome with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=330.64s)]
*  our vectors. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=335.44s)]
*  And then we basically turn microbiome populations into local drug factories. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=337.04s)]
*  And so this really enables us to produce, whether it is nanobodies or small molecules [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=343.12s)]
*  very locally where the bacterial population we're targeting is residing, whether it's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=350.32s)]
*  on the skin, whether it's in close to epithelial cells in the guts, in tumors. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=355.52s)]
*  And so this really enables us to have this local production of molecules where the bacteria reside. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=361.04s)]
*  The microbiome has only really risen to prominence in I guess the last maybe 10 to 15 years. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And usually people associate microbiome with gut health. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=374.08s)]
*  Clearly there are other implications for the health of the entire body. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=378.24s)]
*  I wonder if you could explain the importance of the microbiome in that respect. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=382.12s)]
*  Yeah, so we have trillions of bacteria that are living everywhere in our body, whether [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=386.88s)]
*  it's on the skin, in the lungs, in the guts, in the vagina, but also in tumors. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  Now every month now we started to have papers that highlight the presence of specific bacterial [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=397.76s)]
*  species within tumors. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  And so indeed most of the research has been focused on gut health. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  We at Eligo are focusing now, our lead program is focusing mostly on skin microbiome. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  What's I think fascinating right now is that in the past 10 years we've basically looked [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  at the microbiome at quite a high level. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=420.72s)]
*  So we're using 16S sequencing and so we could see difference in abundance of specific species, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  bacterial species. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  So this led to mostly correlation between, oh, there is this species that has an increase [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  in abundance in this disease or in this condition. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  And so it's likely to have a causal effect or at least being part of one of the driver [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=438.8s)]
*  of the disease. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=446.16s)]
*  And so this has been always hard because sometimes actually it's not the cause, but [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=447.2s)]
*  it's actually consequence of the disease states that then the gut is such in a state that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=451.92s)]
*  these bacterial species can actually grow better and so therefore takes over the niche. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=458.24s)]
*  It's still hard for many conditions to really know if its changes in terms of abundance [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=463.36s)]
*  of bacterial species is either a driving force of the disease or if it's a consequence of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=468.64s)]
*  the disease state. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=474.32s)]
*  But more recently, thanks to deeper sequencing capabilities and new metagenomic capabilities, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=475.2s)]
*  it has been possible to understand, to go at the gene level within the microbiome and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=482.4s)]
*  start to understand relationship between the expression of specific genes from this microbiome [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=488.8s)]
*  and disease. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  And this is really where we believe that the technology, the platform technology we have [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=495.76s)]
*  can have a real impact. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=500.0s)]
*  Now, to give you a couple of examples, typically, we know that in some tumor microbiomes and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  some species that are in tumors, there are some specific genes that when expressed actually [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  drive whole tumorlogic pathways. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=514.16s)]
*  We know in the gut microbiome that there are specific genes that will metabolize hormones [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=516.8s)]
*  and that will have an effect on hormonal levels, not only in the guts, but then in the whole [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=523.76s)]
*  body. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=528.4s)]
*  We know, and when I say we, the scientific community has elucidated that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=529.2s)]
*  We know the same way in terms of metabolism that there are specific genes that have been [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  pinpointed to metabolize drugs that we're taking already and that if this gene is present in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  your microbiome, then it means that the drug will be degraded much more by your microbiome [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=546.24s)]
*  and therefore its bioavailability will be significantly reduced. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=552.0s)]
*  And for our lead program, typically, and this is some work that has been done internally [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=556.32s)]
*  at Illigo, we have found out that there are some specific genes that are responsible for [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=561.12s)]
*  the production of some violence factor in skin commensal that is one of the driver of lesions [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=569.2s)]
*  in acne and moderate to severe acne vulgaris. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=577.5200000000001s)]
*  And so as the technology to understand and read the microbiome genomes at scale, it's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=580.48s)]
*  really exciting because now we're starting to go at the genetic level and understand [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=589.28s)]
*  one gene or multiple gene, the relationship between one gene or multiple bacterial genes [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=592.72s)]
*  and disease. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=596.8s)]
*  And I think this is this precision that will really help us design drugs that will actually [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  work to address microbiome-associated diseases. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=603.84s)]
*  Everybody's microbiome is different. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=607.36s)]
*  How do you account for those differences and how do you pinpoint what the issues are [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=609.12s)]
*  in the microbiome that connect to that disease? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=614.4s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=617.68s)]
*  I think it's far from being elucidated. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=618.96s)]
*  I think most of the disease where the microbiome plays a role are multifactorial. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=621.44s)]
*  I think at least our approach at Illigo is to look at targets and diseases where the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=626.48s)]
*  bacterial species we're targeting is present in everyone. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=637.92s)]
*  And typically when we look at acne vulgaris, the bacterial species we're targeting is called [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=642.8s)]
*  cutibactum acnes. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a commensal bacteria that everyone has really. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  And so we know therefore that when we apply the drug to the patients, it's not going to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=653.76s)]
*  be so much a question of whether the patient has or doesn't have the bacteria we're targeting. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=660.0s)]
*  And so in terms of stratification of patients, this is just much easier. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=666.08s)]
*  The same for tumor microbiome. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  We have an early program on the tumor microbiome and we're specifically focusing on a bacterial [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=672.4000000000001s)]
*  species that has been shown to be present in 80% of all the tumors in colorectal cancer [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=678.64s)]
*  patients. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=686.08s)]
*  And so as of today, because of the knowledge we have of the microbiome, it kind of limits [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=686.88s)]
*  the applications for our platform. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=693.68s)]
*  But still, there are many, but to really reduce this risk of viability, we're only focusing [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  on indications where the presence or absence of these bacteria is not an issue. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=702.0s)]
*  What conditions will you be looking at initially and how? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  We at Illigo are focusing on skin disease right now because we have developed a vector that can [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=712.64s)]
*  deliver genetic payloads to the skin microbiome. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  And our lead indication, and this is the 30 million we've raised, the procedure is going [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=722.88s)]
*  to be mostly used to push this indication to the clinic to get a proof of concept in patients. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  It's in moderate to severe acnevral garris. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=733.44s)]
*  And then we're developing the platform in the oncology space because indeed now it is pretty [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  clear that most tumors are colonized by bacteria. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  And so we're focusing on targeting the bacteria inside the tumor, either to kill them very [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=746.08s)]
*  specifically because it has been shown actually that removing bacteria from tumors does have an [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=751.68s)]
*  impact on the regression of tumors or actually leverage the bacteria that are existing in the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=757.5999999999999s)]
*  tumors to make them produce small molecules or immunomodulatory molecules to actually modify [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=762.88s)]
*  the tumor microenvironments. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=770.2399999999999s)]
*  For instance, modify these tumor microenvironments to increase the efficacy of drugs, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=772.0s)]
*  of immunotherapies, for instance. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=777.92s)]
*  We are also working in the anti-infecture space, but this is a therapeutic area that we're not [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=779.76s)]
*  pursuing with our investor money. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  This is something that we're partnering with the pharma industry, with big pharmas. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=788.16s)]
*  And this is where we're advancing programs ourselves. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=792.16s)]
*  And this is what we can say right now about where we're going. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=795.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=798.88s)]
*  Could you tell me what EB005 is and how that works? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so EB005 is a first in class modality that is a topical CRISPR treatment to treat [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=804.0s)]
*  moderate to severe acne vulgaris. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=813.2s)]
*  So acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin disease there is. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  And it can be mild. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=820.32s)]
*  And the mild, there's not so much unmet need. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  We're focusing at illegal on treating the moderate to severe. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=825.2s)]
*  We're actually just in the US, it's 20 million patients. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=828.08s)]
*  There's a huge unmet need. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=830.96s)]
*  That is often not really perceptible and seen by the common population. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=832.72s)]
*  But when you have moderate to severe acne, you have between 40 and 60 percent of patients [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=837.28s)]
*  who are depressed. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=843.12s)]
*  You have 80 percent who have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=844.88s)]
*  And these patients have only two, basically the first line of treatments, which is not [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=849.12s)]
*  really working, which is mostly topical antibiotics or steroids. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=856.08s)]
*  And the second line of treatment, which is the magic bullet. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=860.16s)]
*  And I think everyone has heard about this drug, which is Accutane, the molecule is [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  isothertonoine. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  And that is teratogenic that has 100 percent side effects. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=869.04s)]
*  And basically, it's really this last resort drug that dermatologists are really reluctant [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=873.52s)]
*  to prescribe. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  And even patients who are on this drug, more than 40 and 50 percent of patients drop out [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=879.36s)]
*  because of the side effects. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  And so it's been 30 years that in acne, there's been almost no innovation in the field. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=886.08s)]
*  And only recently, there's been a hint that there is something about subpopulations of [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=891.68s)]
*  bacteria on the skin. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=897.68s)]
*  So when you look at acne vulgaris and the disease itself, it's a multifactorial disease. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=898.56s)]
*  It's a sort of inflammation of the hair follicle. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=903.76s)]
*  And whether it would depend on what you eat, your hormonal stage, there's a number of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=906.32s)]
*  factors that will change the hair follicle environment. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=912.32s)]
*  Production of more sebum, the pore is going to be clogged. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=916.08s)]
*  But one of the key drivers is actually the microbiome. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=919.36s)]
*  And so on the skin, we have this bacteria called cutiebactome acnes. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=923.84s)]
*  It's a commensal that we all have on our skin. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=926.88s)]
*  It represents 80 percent of the bacteria we have on our skin in terms of abundance. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=929.04s)]
*  And healthy patients and acne patients do have this bacteria. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  What has been now shown is, and this is where the company at AGO, we've done a lot of bioinformatics [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=939.04s)]
*  work also to really validate the targets, is that within the species of cutiebactome acnes, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  when you look at acne patients and it increases the severity of acne, you have a subpopulation [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=952.24s)]
*  within this bacterial species that actually is overrepresented in acne patients. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=959.36s)]
*  And what characterizes this population, this subpopulation of within the species, is actually [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=965.76s)]
*  the expression of viral factor, of proinflammatory viral factor that are actually driving the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=971.12s)]
*  inflammatory process in their hair follicle. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=977.76s)]
*  And so what we're developing at AGO is a highly precise CRISPR drug that will be delivered [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=980.16s)]
*  into this bacterial species on the skin. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=988.88s)]
*  And we're programming the nuclease to specifically target regions in the bacterial genome that are [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=991.12s)]
*  unique to the subpopulation that is proinflammatory. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=997.92s)]
*  And therefore, the whole goal of the treatment is to destroy these very specifically, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1002.08s)]
*  this subpopulation while leaving the health associated population of bacteria completely intact. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1008.72s)]
*  And so this is kind of a game changing because when you look at the first line treatments, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1014.4s)]
*  which are topical antibiotics, first they don't work because 80% of now the population [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1019.04s)]
*  has bacteria on the skin that are resistant to these antibiotics. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  But for the few people in which the antibiotics can still kill the bacteria, they will kill both [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1027.76s)]
*  the health associated one and the acne associated one. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  And so as soon as you stop the antibiotic treatments, basically both population will go [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1037.68s)]
*  up again and so the lesions are going to appear again. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  And so the solution we provide is a highly safe solution in the sense that it's phage derived. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1045.28s)]
*  So our phage, we have billions of phage in our body. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1051.28s)]
*  There's been now a number of trials with phages. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1055.44s)]
*  So this modality itself is safe. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1058.0s)]
*  The phages will only deliver the CRISPR in the bacteria, not human cells. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1060.64s)]
*  And the efficacy will be brought by the killing of the proinflammatory strains. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1065.92s)]
*  And what's interesting is that it's very likely to have a durable effect, which is something [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  that dermatologists and treatment are looking for. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1079.12s)]
*  Meaning when you kill just the proinflammatory population, then you free the niche for the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1081.9199999999998s)]
*  healthy population to take over and fill this niche, which will exert by itself a significant [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1088.7199999999998s)]
*  pressure for the 0.1% of the proinflammatory that you not killed. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1093.9199999999998s)]
*  When you try to kill bacteria, never kill 100%. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
*  But so if you have this niche taken by the health, especially one, then you will really [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1100.24s)]
*  prevent the very small fraction of proinflammatory ones you've left, you didn't kill, to grow again. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1106.08s)]
*  And this is what we're going to study in the trials. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1112.08s)]
*  I think this will be a game changer in the field because it's going to be safe and efficient [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1114.4s)]
*  and likely durable. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1118.64s)]
*  And this is what patients are looking for. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1120.0s)]
*  Will it be something that's applied topically and will it have to be reapplied or just the ones? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1122.48s)]
*  Yeah, so I think it's going to be topically, it's going to be a gel, a topical gel. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1127.84s)]
*  So the fundraising is going to help us to get to the clinic. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1133.28s)]
*  So we're going to do a trial in the US with the planned provenance of data in 25. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  And this trial will be a phase 1B2A trial, so directly in patients. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1142.72s)]
*  And so the goal will be to see signs for, of course, safety and durability. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1147.52s)]
*  But first sign of efficacy, so potentially reduction of number of lesions, reduction of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  AGI score. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1158.32s)]
*  And we're also going to look at this durability. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1159.68s)]
*  We're going to have, we're going to try to generate first data on durability of treatments. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1162.88s)]
*  For this first trial, we're going to do probably once or twice daily application for eight weeks, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1166.32s)]
*  just to try to maximize the chance to have this chance of seeing impact on the disease. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1173.84s)]
*  What we believe is that we'll have to use it probably a couple of weeks as a non-product. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1181.28s)]
*  But that's fine in the sense that this is typically what's done today with drugs. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1186.56s)]
*  And there is quite some compliance for weeks is actually quite good in acne, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  and specifically in moderate to severe acne. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1197.2s)]
*  Then whether after a treatment of eight weeks, the durability will be two, three months or [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1199.6s)]
*  six months before you need to reapply it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1204.96s)]
*  We'll see this in the next phases, in the next treatment clinical trials. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1207.2s)]
*  We're quite confident actually that the durability will be significant because when you look at the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1211.36s)]
*  stability and there is some longitudinal data on skin microbiome, and you see that it doesn't [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1215.6s)]
*  vary really, really fast. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1221.36s)]
*  Basically, every, when you look at the scale of years, you have at least in this population [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1223.2s)]
*  of cutobactin, acne in this species, you have one or two clones that change over the course [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1228.96s)]
*  of years in patients. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1234.16s)]
*  So we're quite confident that if we remove a few clones that are co-inflammatory, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1235.12s)]
*  the new states of the micro should be quite robust for at least a couple of months. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1240.88s)]
*  It's good news for people that have the condition for sure. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1247.68s)]
*  So many of them. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1251.7600000000002s)]
*  So I think that's great. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  And hopefully what's interesting is also it's a CRISPR drug. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1254.96s)]
*  When you hear about CRISPR drugs, you were thinking millions of dollars in pricing typically. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1259.2800000000002s)]
*  The beauty is that we are producing our modality by classical bacterial fermentation. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1265.44s)]
*  And so the costs of production of the molecule of the modality are logs lower than when you [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1271.52s)]
*  are producing eukaryotic gene editing therapy. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1279.8400000000001s)]
*  And so the price of the drugs is also going to be logs lower. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1283.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask you about that because obviously with something like acne, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1288.4s)]
*  the last thing that you need is for this to be so expensive that it's unrealistically priced. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1292.48s)]
*  Yeah, so basically if you look at the first line antibiotics, it's about anywhere between [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1298.8s)]
*  100 or close to $100 per month. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1304.24s)]
*  And isotretinoin is between 4,000 and 6,000 for the treatments. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1307.68s)]
*  And so I think our pricing will really depend on this, on the efficacy and durability of the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1312.88s)]
*  treatment. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1317.36s)]
*  But the cost of goods are totally reasonable when you think about a pricing like that. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1319.36s)]
*  For sure. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  You already mentioned cancer. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1327.36s)]
*  Are there other diseases that this would be applicable to treating? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1329.36s)]
*  Yeah, so there are basically tons of disease. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  The target list is expanding on a monthly basis. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1338.56s)]
*  The question is then how much risk you're willing to take to develop the drugs. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1342.8s)]
*  Every time it's often a new bacteria that pops up. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  And so the question is clearly there are links and then it's how much do you invest [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1351.04s)]
*  to validate this thing between the gene and the disease. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1356.24s)]
*  But typically metabolic disease, hormonal disease, drug interaction with the microbiome. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1359.76s)]
*  And so by the availability of drugs, typically the gut microbiome or the skin microbiome [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1367.6s)]
*  plays a tremendous role in modifying the small molecules you have in your body, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1373.28s)]
*  mostly because a lot of them come from the gut. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  And so it's not so much like specific therapeutic indication. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  It's more about what is the mechanism, where does the molecules that has an impact on your brain, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1387.76s)]
*  on your heart, on tumors is metabolized, is produced. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1394.32s)]
*  And so right now we're not focusing specifically on one or two therapeutic areas. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1399.12s)]
*  We're mostly looking at specific bacterial reservoir and what happened in this reservoir. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1405.28s)]
*  Because like in gene therapy, it's like when you have a vector that can get to the organ you want, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1413.2s)]
*  then you can treat a number of diseases that are associated to the organ. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1419.76s)]
*  It's exactly the same for us. We see the microbiome as multiple organs. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1424.08s)]
*  You have the skin microbiome, the gut microbiome, the tumor microbiome. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1428.08s)]
*  And so we're developing these vectors for each of these microbiome. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1431.76s)]
*  And then whether the skin microbiome, you have skin disease like acne, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1436.08s)]
*  but you also have cancers, you have skin cancer, you have other skin disease. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1442.0s)]
*  When you think about the gut, you have so good disease. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1447.4399999999998s)]
*  Again, we're more focusing on the molecules that are produced by the gut microbiome. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1451.44s)]
*  And that can have an impact on the brain, on your heart, on tumors. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  And so basically, we see this more like a platform play, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1460.56s)]
*  where we have W vectors that enables us to create, modify functions from these different [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  organs that can have applications across therapeutic areas. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1472.72s)]
*  It's interesting that you mentioned that because a few weeks ago on the podcast, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1476.48s)]
*  we had a company on there that is tackling things like Alzheimer's by modifying the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1479.68s)]
*  gut microbiome. Do you think there's a place for sort of a combination of treatments whereby you're [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1487.6000000000001s)]
*  manipulating the microbiome and changing it through your techniques? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1494.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. I think what's really important is to understand as soon as you [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1499.2s)]
*  understand the mechanism by which the microbiome produces more molecule that interacts with the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1503.68s)]
*  gut brain axis, as soon as you have identified that, then you can have treatments that, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1511.28s)]
*  I don't know, decrease the amyloid plaque that are already there. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1517.8400000000001s)]
*  And then in combination, you treat your microbiome to make sure that it doesn't [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1522.3200000000002s)]
*  lead to the creation of new amyloid plaques. It has been shown typically that there are some [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1528.0s)]
*  molecules produced by the gut microbiome that do trigger or are linked to the formation of these [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1532.16s)]
*  plaques. So I think indeed, I would say there is a big opportunity space in modifying the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1537.2s)]
*  microbiome as combination therapy, either to potentially make the therapy more efficient or [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1543.28s)]
*  more durable and prevent relapse of disease typically. One of the things that you announced [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1548.88s)]
*  recently was your Series B funding. What is the implication of that in your work? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1554.0800000000002s)]
*  That's an exciting milestone for the company. We have at Eligo advanced quite far in demonstrating [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1560.0s)]
*  animal models on the GMP manufacturing side of things, on the regulatory pathways to bring our [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1566.72s)]
*  modality forward to the clinic. And so this fundraising will now help us to move to the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1574.24s)]
*  next stage. So really bring this EB005 program from a lead candidate to a proof of concept in [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1580.56s)]
*  patients by the end of 2025. And so we're super lucky to have some of the inventors who led the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1588.0s)]
*  round, BPI friends through their fund in OBO2, and our existing backers, Coastal Adventures and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1594.64s)]
*  Seventre partners who are also supporting us again through this round. And it's going to be [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1600.96s)]
*  I think the round that will lead to the biggest value creation in the company in the sense that [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1608.48s)]
*  we're finally going to be able to test our modality in patients, in real patients. And [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1614.8s)]
*  that's the cool thing with advancing with acne vulgaris and modality severe is that we don't [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1618.8s)]
*  have to do a phase one in healthy patients, we can directly move to acne patients and have this [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1622.56s)]
*  efficacy, first sign of efficacy data coming out of this trial. So this will prove two things. First, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1627.68s)]
*  it will be a very interesting asset play because we'll have the acne assets and demonstrating that [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1634.56s)]
*  it has an impact on acne, on the severity of acne. It will also demonstrate the technology itself, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1641.12s)]
*  that we have a good target engagement and that we can deliver CRISPR in a human complex microbiome [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  environment and modify the genetic makeup of the microbiome, de-risking basically the whole platform [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1655.12s)]
*  concepts in other therapeutic areas. And so this is why also in the background, while most, I mean, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1661.6799999999998s)]
*  our focus will be clearly on delivering this proof of concept in patient in acne, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1667.1999999999998s)]
*  we're also this earlier program in oncology, in other areas that are we're advancing in the [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1671.28s)]
*  background so that as soon as we have this proof of concept of the, this proof of concept data [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  in acne, the platform has been de-risked. And so we can likely get another round to advance [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1681.9199999999998s)]
*  the acne program in phase twos, but get the other early programs in the clinic. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1689.28s)]
*  Well, that's certainly hopeful news for those suffering with acne and also good for those who [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1698.08s)]
*  treat it. And it would seem that Eligo's platform will be able to tackle more than just acne. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1703.1999999999998s)]
*  So it's a case of watch this space and follow the company's progress over the coming years. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1710.1599999999999s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu. And I hope wherever [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGfJlZUwWYc&t=1715.84s)]
