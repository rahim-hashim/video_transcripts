# Looking to cure Type 1 diabetes
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 99. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. This week on the podcast we have a conversation about treatments [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=16.68s)]
*  of type 1 diabetes. Our guest is Anders S. Møller, founder and chairman of Diamid Medical, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=23.68s)]
*  which is addressing type 1 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults through its [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  product Diamid. This is an antigen specific immunomodulatory therapeutic for the preservation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=39.72s)]
*  of endogenous insulin production. Alright, so I guess the first and hopefully the easiest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=47.4s)]
*  questions, if you could give me a little bit of background on the company and how it was formed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=55.16s)]
*  Formed, okay, yes. So it's a pleasure to be here. I'm Anders S. Møller. I'm the chairman and the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=61.2s)]
*  founder of this company, Diamid Medical, who has come rather far in developing pharmaceutical [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=68.56s)]
*  for type 1 diabetes. It really started in the 90s when my daughter, 10 years old, came out with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=77.28s)]
*  type 1 diabetes. It was a dramatic incident and I had some experience from the disease. I worked [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=85.84s)]
*  on the medical technology side before on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and also [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  on metabolic diseases. I came from the medical technical background and I had started a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=101.16s)]
*  meta company before, software company, when my daughter came out with type 1 diabetes. So what [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=109.08s)]
*  happened was that we traveled around, I traveled around trying to find something that could help [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=116.92s)]
*  my daughter. And I met Oke Lundmark in, I think in Kyoto in Japan, and he tipped me about this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=123.16s)]
*  molecule GAD65. And I looked up the GAD65 and I found that there were basically three universities [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=131.24s)]
*  working with it. It was UCLA with Dan Kaufman and he had just published something about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=141.04s)]
*  GAD65. So I went there and licensed the rights to develop the product in 1994, I think. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=147.76s)]
*  And then I went to the University of Washington and licensed their intellectual property rights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=155.2s)]
*  And I went to the University of Florida and met Mark Atkinson, who is now a professor [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=161.68s)]
*  in diabetes and also on our board of directors. And I licensed his intellectual rights. So from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  having three antagonists, I mean the University of Washington, Seattle and UCLA, there were now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=179.36s)]
*  three friendly universities that all wanted three American technologies or professors that wanted [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=187.36s)]
*  the same thing. And so we had suddenly a very broad expert team that could help us design, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=194.24s)]
*  you know, what to do. And we met in Sweden later on, a couple of months later, and we had this guy, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Hans Wichsel, who at that time was the rector of the Karolinska Institute and professor in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=211.12s)]
*  immunology. And he came in, he was very busy, he came in and said, well, do like this, take the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=219.04s)]
*  drug, take the whole molecule, don't try and find parts of the molecule, let the immune system decide [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=225.6s)]
*  which parts of the molecule it should react against, formulate it in all of them, try five doses, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=233.44s)]
*  four, 20, 100, 500 micrograms, do a boost, a primary boost, and then he went. So that's what we do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=242.0s)]
*  I mean, we know that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=252.56s)]
*  certain parts of the beta cells. It could be insulin, it could be GAD. I mean, there are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=260.72s)]
*  basically two main lines of the disease. One is an insulin-induced diabetes and the other one is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=268.48s)]
*  a GAD-induced diabetes. That is based basically on genetics and why the immune system reacts against [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  these beta antigens, auto antigens, we don't know for sure. When it comes to, for instance, GAD, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=284.48s)]
*  which is produced in the beta cells, it could be that the patient has had a previous disease, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=293.44s)]
*  with a virus that is similar to the GAD antigen, or it could be that there is something wrong with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=302.0s)]
*  the beta cells. It could be that the GAD antigen hasn't been seen by the immune system. It could [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=310.0s)]
*  be that it has been a sequestered antigen that suddenly when it gets disposed and you have the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=316.32s)]
*  right gene to sort of detect it and present it in a bad way, then you could develop autoimmunity [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=322.88s)]
*  against GAD-65. When it comes to insulin, it could be similar things. It could be that you had an [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=329.44s)]
*  infection when you were young. There are protocols where people try and vaccinate young guys to see [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=336.88s)]
*  if they can prevent diabetes that way when they are really young. It could be something wrong with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=344.24s)]
*  how the insulin molecule is developed in the beta cells, pre-pro insulin, pro insulin, etc. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  There are many, many ways how type 1 diabetes could develop. Stress, different habits, genetics, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  infection, etc. We were happy to find this solution already then. In 1995, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=369.2s)]
*  we knew that if we could stop the autoimmunity, if we could just stop that, then the beta cells [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=379.36s)]
*  would not deteriorate. What happens in the immune system when the immunity is going on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=387.68s)]
*  is that first it starts attacking the beta cells. Then the patient may experience high blood sugar [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=396.24s)]
*  without knowing it. Then after a time, there are so few beta cells left or the insulin production [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=403.12s)]
*  is so low that the patient ends up at the hospital and he needs to take immediately insulin injections [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=410.56s)]
*  for the rest of his life. If he doesn't do that, he dies. It's a good disease to treat. I mean, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=418.16s)]
*  you could save the life, so that's nice. But of course, it's terrible for the patient. He needs to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=423.92s)]
*  check his blood sugar every day. He needs to take insulin every day. His mother and father [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=430.4s)]
*  checks on their phones what their kids have as blood sugar levels in school and they call. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=437.52s)]
*  They don't know if they should call the guys and ask them to take extra insulin injections. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  Psychologically, it's a terrible disease. It's really bad. It screws up the life [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=453.28s)]
*  for many, many people. There is definitely a big need to prevent the disease and to cure disease. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=459.12s)]
*  Preventing the disease is going on. We have now a drug that is approved by FDA where an anti-CD3 [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=470.08s)]
*  is an antibody. Antibody gains anti-CD3. An anti-CD3 antibody that sort of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=481.36s)]
*  suppresses the immune system. It sort of eliminates the T cells and the T cells are those [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  attacking the beta cells. They get destroyed and in that way, you can delay the disease for about [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=495.84s)]
*  three years at the moment, which is very good. It's just that if you don't have T cells, you can get [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  a lot of other immune diseases. You may get real bad diseases. I won't even mention the names. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=507.68s)]
*  There are terrible diseases you can get if you don't have, if it suppresses you or if you take [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=515.12s)]
*  out your immune system. Moreover, what is good for us in a way is that they manage to get a very high [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=521.12s)]
*  price, like $200,000 for a 14-day treatment where they get these injections of anti-CD3 [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=528.4000000000001s)]
*  antibodies against the immune system. That is, of course, expensive and it paves the way for other [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=538.08s)]
*  therapies like ours that don't sort of compromise the immune system. We go directly to a certain [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=548.0s)]
*  antigen. With that, I step back and when we started to develop this medicine, we started [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=554.8s)]
*  with small studies in LADA patients and in type 1 diabetes patients. There are about 500,000 new [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=563.92s)]
*  type 1 diabetes in the world every year and 50,000 of them have the gene that we treat at the moment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=573.76s)]
*  In the beginning, we sort of treated everybody. We didn't know about the genes and we got as far as [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=583.2s)]
*  to phase 3 studies. We teamed up with J&J. They paid us a lot of money and with milestones, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=590.4s)]
*  it was one of the biggest deals in Sweden, one of the biggest biotech deals in Sweden. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=600.72s)]
*  We did two phase 3 studies, one in Europe and one in the States. When we looked at the results from [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=606.64s)]
*  the European phase 3 studies, we saw it worked but didn't work well enough. We wondered why [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=615.52s)]
*  doesn't it work well enough and we couldn't come out with a conclusion. The COVID, could it be? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  That was not COVID, that was sort of the swine flu, different types of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=630.64s)]
*  of flu. Could that interfere? We didn't know and we looked at some of the old studies. They worked. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=635.28s)]
*  We took the money we had in the company, like several hundred million crowns and gave that out [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=642.4s)]
*  to the shareholders. We kept 50 million Swedish crowns and we kept the data and the names and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=648.88s)]
*  we started all over and we made a small new financing and started out trying different, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  it was like a living AI brain. I mean you try does this work, does that work and then you learn and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=666.32s)]
*  you come up with some new ideas. Does this work and you try it and you learn and you get the results. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=674.32s)]
*  What we did, we looked at the genes for example and we found that there were certain genes that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  where our drug worked. There was a haplotype DQ2 type gene where it seemed that GAD worked and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=690.24s)]
*  there was a haplotype DR4-DQ8 gene where it seemed that the insulin antigen would work and that was [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=698.8s)]
*  about half half, 55 percent of the western population at least have this DR3-DQ2 gene. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=706.32s)]
*  We did new studies where we found meta studies where we sort of, I think we had like 15 studies [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  where we looked does it really work? Yes it really does work and we filed patents of course of that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=723.36s)]
*  with and we have good IP protection for the GAD auto antigen and DR3-DQ2 and we have some [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=730.96s)]
*  IP protection for the DR4-DQ8 with the insulin antigen so that looks very good and it looks [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  real. We published our meta studies and at the same time there were big, Batalaggia published [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  their big studies where they also found that there was a GAD form of the type 1 diabetes and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=758.16s)]
*  there was an insulin form of type 1 diabetes so it was really a discovery. I mean it was discovered, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=764.0s)]
*  it was like the brains, the AI brains, they found this and they found that and they checked it and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=770.4s)]
*  they came up with results and now you need to sort of just confirm what you have learned and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=777.12s)]
*  we are doing that right now. We are doing a phase 3 study, 300 patients, 8 European and US [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=786.88s)]
*  where we inject GAD in those that have that particular gene and there was one more discovery [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=795.36s)]
*  made and that was in allergy. You had pet allergy and wheat allergy, grass and pollen and stuff like [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=805.04s)]
*  that. Usually when you get allergen treatment you inject the allergen and you could do that for [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=813.84s)]
*  yours, I mean weekly or monthly injections of the allergen and it works but it takes time and it's [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  real cumbersome for the patients to go through that kind of therapy and then there were guys [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  who tried to inject the allergen directly into the lymph system, the lymph nodes. They found that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=836.88s)]
*  they could with only three injections more or less cure the allergy long term for yours. Instead of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  treating for yours they could do three injections once per month and they could also use much less [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  allergen. They could use a hundredth of the allergen that they used in this long term [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=862.8s)]
*  allergy treatment. So we tried, Johnny Ludvigsen he said to us try this directly [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=869.92s)]
*  into the lymphatic. We did some inventions there and so we decided to try four micrograms, that's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=877.68s)]
*  almost nothing, three times directly in the lymph nodes. So we started safety study, diagnosed one [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=885.52s)]
*  and then we went further with diagnosed two, two ways study, two B study and we found that it worked [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=892.48s)]
*  again in those DR3 DQ2. So I mean it's really that we know it works in the DR3 DQ2. There are other [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=899.28s)]
*  genes, there may be genes where it doesn't work, there may be genes that helps etc but it works in [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=908.64s)]
*  DR3 DQ2. So it's really a matter of just doing it and we are just doing it. We have now 110 patients [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=915.04s)]
*  in and there is a lot of discussions what is really a treatment of type 1 diabetes. We say that we are [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=923.8399999999999s)]
*  treating the beta cells. The beta cells are being destroyed by the autoimmune system so we try and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  save them, saving beta cell function and we can do that by measuring how much insulin they produce. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=941.2s)]
*  I mean if they are attacked they don't produce insulin, if they are not attacked they produce [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=949.6s)]
*  insulin, if they are left. So we need to save them from becoming destroyed and save them from being [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=954.24s)]
*  attacked and by doing so we treat the type 1 diabetes. There are those who say that we need [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  to show that it also improves the long-term A1C levels, the glucose levels, the blood [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=970.48s)]
*  glucosylated levels and of course that's good but I mean there are so many ways where you can keep [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  your blood sugar levels in check. You can eat good food, you can go out and walk, you can work out, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=988.24s)]
*  you can take different pills. If you in spite of that have too high levels of blood glucose, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=997.84s)]
*  you take more insulin. So I mean really the doctors they are there to treat your diabetes, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1004.48s)]
*  to keep your blood sugar level in check. They don't bother about how much insulin you produce [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  yourself. So they don't really bother about the disease, the origin of the disease. The origin of [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1018.6400000000001s)]
*  the disease is how much insulin you can produce. If you can produce enough insulin you don't need [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1025.6s)]
*  to do all these things. You can eat sugar, you don't have to eat gymnast to work out. Of course [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1033.04s)]
*  it's good to do that too and now with the new GLP antagonists etc. you sort of reduce your body fat [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1040.56s)]
*  and you increase your insulin sensitivity which is good. All those things are good. So that's the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  parallel thing but still what you want to do, you want to have your insulin cells to produce insulin [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1055.2s)]
*  and you know that if you can do that you have the foundation of the new pharmaceutical industry [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  worldwide. There are about 500 million with diabetes or which 10 percent at least is type 1 [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1070.8s)]
*  diabetes patients and you have an autoimmune form of the type 2 diabetes, LADA. So I mean it's a huge [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1078.16s)]
*  huge multi-billion industry if you can sort of prevent the beta cells from becoming distracted. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1086.96s)]
*  And then of course you have to make sure that they increase their insulin producing capacity. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  The best thing is of course if you can stop the beginning of the disease. Once [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  once beta cells are becoming attacked and the disease is progressing towards insulin dependency [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1109.12s)]
*  if you can stop it before the patients become insulin dependent then you have hit the graal [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1116.9599999999998s)]
*  and there is no reason why we shouldn't be able to do that. I mean it's really if it works when you have [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1126.3999999999999s)]
*  type 1 diabetes it works before you have the type diabetes because it attacks the same [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  molecule treating the same cells. So I would say it's a done deal, it's just a wait. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1141.4399999999998s)]
*  We say we'll stop the diabetes in its tracks and that's a good thing. Are there different [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1149.6s)]
*  approaches to tackling type 1 diabetes other than the treatment that you're using? Yes, yes, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1157.68s)]
*  yes there are many. I mean over the past 30 years I think there have been hundreds [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1165.2s)]
*  of different types of diabetes. And I mean you have the anti-CD3 antibodies which is now approved [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1171.84s)]
*  for in the states to prevent type 1 diabetes which is priced at $200,000. You have anti-CD20 [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  antibodies which is against the B cells, B lymphocytes. You have different types of [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1188.9599999999998s)]
*  antibodies IL-21, IL-17 etc. Trying different sort of things, changing the immune system. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1196.4s)]
*  You have ATG antibodies, rabbit. You have new humanized antibodies similar to the ATGs. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1205.52s)]
*  You have GLP-1 antagonists that sort of works for type 2 diabetes and for fat and they also induce [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1216.24s)]
*  better insulin production etc. So there are so many and you have the stem cells coming. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1228.72s)]
*  If you have stem cells from your relatives you know you don't need immune suppression but if [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1236.16s)]
*  you get stem cells from somebody else you need lifelong immune suppression. If you encapsulate [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1242.48s)]
*  your stem cells you may have to exchange them etc. So really what it comes down to is to [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1248.96s)]
*  treat the disease and that is to keep your beta cells from doing what they're supposed to do. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1256.72s)]
*  And I guess the number of cases of diabetes seems to be on the rise. How important is it to, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1263.2800000000002s)]
*  because it's a global issue, how important is it to try and keep costs down? Yes it's very [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1270.0s)]
*  very important. I think in the states the cost for type 1 diabetes is more than 100 billion dollars [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1276.64s)]
*  per year and there are those who have the hypothesis of cleanliness. I mean the more [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1282.48s)]
*  clean you are, the more you wash, the more antibiotics you take, the less bacteria you [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1290.32s)]
*  have in your bowel etc. with the microbiomes etc. The more autoimmune disease may come up. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1296.88s)]
*  I mean the immune system is there for a reason. It has to be constantly working to prevent cancers [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1306.24s)]
*  and all sorts of diseases to take control of your body. So the more medicines out there, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1314.88s)]
*  the more diseases you're probably going to see and the more expensive it's going to be. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1321.12s)]
*  Are you hopeful in the long term that type 1 diabetes can be at least managed and maybe [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1328.6399999999999s)]
*  cured? Yes I'm very hopeful. As a matter of fact I'm convinced that it's going to be cured. I mean [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1336.9599999999998s)]
*  with antibody antigen specific precision medicine you will be able to sort of stop the autoimmunity [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1343.76s)]
*  and then if you do it already before type 1 stage 3 has broken out then you're on the way [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1352.16s)]
*  to a cure by perhaps by regeneration. The beta cells that are there they may regenerate [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1361.44s)]
*  or you may stimulate regeneration with additional therapies. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1368.48s)]
*  Type 1 diabetes is definitely a condition that most people are aware of and with the numbers of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1378.24s)]
*  patients rising it's great that companies like Diomid are confident that they're able to make [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1384.8s)]
*  a positive difference. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCf9Dk3pWlc&t=1391.12s)]
