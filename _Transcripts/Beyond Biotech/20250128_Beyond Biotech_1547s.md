# Tackling challenging diseases with vaccines
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 76, and this is the last one in 2023 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=0.0s)]
*  before the holidays, and a bit of a break before launching again in January. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=17.44s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly LeBioTech podcast, and this week we're talking vaccines [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=23.2s)]
*  with MeMeHu, CEO of Vaccinity. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=29.0s)]
*  The US based company is pioneering a new class of vaccines that convert the body into its [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=33.4s)]
*  own natural drug factory by stimulating the production of antibodies. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=40.08s)]
*  The company is ambitious, it's looking to address a wide range of chronic diseases such [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=45.46s)]
*  as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, migraine and high cholesterol with a robust clinical pipeline. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=51.04s)]
*  So let's find out more. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=57.86s)]
*  So maybe we could start if you could give me some background on Vaccinity and how it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=59.94s)]
*  started and how it kind of grew to where you are today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=65.3s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=68.74s)]
*  Listen, every evolution story is different, but I'd say most of them never think that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=69.74s)]
*  they're going to grow up to who they are if you ask them when they started. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  And that's no different from Vaccinity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=78.86s)]
*  I was born into a biotech background and became a lawyer and economist by training, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=80.82s)]
*  but really kept getting drawn back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=87.5s)]
*  And it was through a predecessor of Vaccinity where the technology was really incubated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=90.3s)]
*  It proved itself as a synthetic peptide vaccine platform and a variety of other applications, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  in particular in animal health. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  And my partner and I saw the potential of saying, hey, what if we could really apply [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=103.3s)]
*  this technology of vaccinating against self-antigen to humans? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=108.92s)]
*  And that was kind of where Vaccinity as a concept was born. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=113.48s)]
*  Of course, the world takes you in many ways and there's iterations, so we went through [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=117.56s)]
*  different corporate structures. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  But Vaccinity came together about two years ago in its current incarnation where we're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=123.48s)]
*  focused on developing vaccines for chronic diseases around the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=128.56s)]
*  It's been a long dream in the making and we still have a good ways to go, but the impact [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=132.96s)]
*  is tremendous of what we're trying to achieve. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=138.24s)]
*  What is it that you're trying to achieve and can you maybe explain a little bit about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=141.16s)]
*  your approach and how it differs from other approaches? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  So we are developing vaccines for chronic diseases or active immunotherapies. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  And what that means is we're teaching your body to protect itself from things like Alzheimer's, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=154.96s)]
*  Parkinson's, migraine, all the major diseases that affect millions or billions of people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  And the main difference is in the scalability and accessibility and the model of how vaccines [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=166.08s)]
*  can work versus other drugs today that attack and treat chronic diseases. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=172.28s)]
*  80% of the entire globe is vaccinated. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  We saw in COVID that you can rapidly deploy billions of doses around the world, whereas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=180.4s)]
*  traditional biologics are very limited by their supply and their complexity and their [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=186.84s)]
*  price. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=191.4s)]
*  The real difference is the ability to what we call democratize health and get transformative [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  treatments to everyone in the world that needs them at a price that everyone can really afford [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  and accept. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  And that means that you can make a massive impact and a real dent in the diseases. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  So our goal is when we're successful, 10 years later, will there be more or less Alzheimer's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=209.52s)]
*  patients out there? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=214.72s)]
*  We want there to be a benefit for the world, not just a select few. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=215.86s)]
*  I think that's really important because quite often companies come in with the idea of we'll [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  go to the US, maybe Europe, Japan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=225.68s)]
*  So I think it's important that it is global and that it's affordable, that kind of thing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=229.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a key tenet of what we do because there are other folks that are working on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  Alzheimer's, there are other folks that are working on heart disease. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  But the main differentiator is our vision for global impact and having almost like no [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  patient left behind. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=248.84s)]
*  And the only way you can do that is with the technology that can do that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=250.4s)]
*  And the pharma industry hasn't had that as a classic model. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=253.68s)]
*  And I don't blame anyone. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=258.0s)]
*  It's because there are limitations to the current technologies out there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  They're expensive to make, they're complex to manufacture, and there's limited supply, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=263.32s)]
*  just capital infrastructure today. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=267.92s)]
*  And so they have to have a different model. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=270.16s)]
*  But when you can do it in a vaccine form, that's when the model can change. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=272.24s)]
*  And that's what's really exciting about what we're doing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=276.02s)]
*  I wonder if you could explain a little bit about your new class of vaccines and how it [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=279.12s)]
*  trains the body. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=282.84s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=283.84s)]
*  So, you know, we're a synthetic peptide vaccine platform. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=284.84s)]
*  And what we do is we select epitopes based on the targets that we want to elicit an immune [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=289.4s)]
*  response to. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=294.4s)]
*  So everyone understands vaccines popularized by COVID, where one of the keys is that we [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=295.44s)]
*  want to get your immune system to produce antibodies, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  So we want to activate these B cells to produce antibodies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=304.96s)]
*  The challenge with going after chronic diseases, though, is that your immune system is very [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  smart. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=311.88s)]
*  It's probably one of the most sophisticated machines in the world. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=312.88s)]
*  And it doesn't like to make antibodies that attack itself. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  If it did that naturally, that's the cause of autoimmune disease. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  So it's trained itself to really not do that against key proteins in your body. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=323.26s)]
*  The problem is, as we get older, some of those key proteins are actually the cause of disease, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=328.96s)]
*  either because there's too much of them being produced or your body can't clear them fast [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  enough, or in fact, they begin mutating and misfolding and then becoming toxic themselves. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=338.08s)]
*  So the trick with our technology is we literally trick your body into thinking that these things [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=344.0s)]
*  are foreign and thus induce an immune response, so induce an antibody response to in fact [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=349.88s)]
*  neutralize some of these. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  So for every disease we go after, Jim, there's a different target, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=358.04s)]
*  So for Alzheimer's, our lead vaccine is against aggregated amyloid protein. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=361.1s)]
*  For hypoclastremia, it's something called PCSK9. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=366.94s)]
*  A lot of these targets have been validated before by drugs before them, but never in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=370.38s)]
*  this type of approach. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  And so really the trick of our synthetic peptide technology is being able to trick the body [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  into thinking that something itself is actually foreign and thus being able to activate that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  immune system. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=387.06s)]
*  Obviously, things like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, a lot of people are trying to tackle those [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=388.62s)]
*  and it's very difficult. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=394.86s)]
*  How does your approach kind of differ from traditional approaches in order to succeed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  where other companies may have had limited success? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=402.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=405.86s)]
*  So there are two comparisons that are classically made. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=406.86s)]
*  The first is to other vaccine companies. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=409.06s)]
*  And there have been other companies that have tried to develop a vaccine for Alzheimer's, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=412.06s)]
*  for instance. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=416.5s)]
*  And I always applaud the pioneers who paved the way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=417.62s)]
*  One of the first companies was a company called Lahn. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=420.74s)]
*  And they had early promise, but the problem was that a good portion, almost 4% of their [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=423.5s)]
*  population had safety side effects of meningitis encephalitis, which is like T cell inflammation. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  That's not good when it comes to a drug treatment. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=436.18s)]
*  And they had to cancel that program. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=438.9s)]
*  So one of the key tenants of our platform is the safety profile. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=440.78000000000003s)]
*  We're able to induce an antibody response without generating that similar T cell inflammation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=444.74s)]
*  And that's a homework of our vaccine platform. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=450.82s)]
*  So the safety is the number one thing, especially when you go into thinking about immunotherapies [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=453.68s)]
*  for the masses. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=459.94s)]
*  And the second, where we've really focused on is actually being able to do something [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=461.36s)]
*  called break immune tolerance. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=466.44s)]
*  And immune tolerance is exactly what I was talking about just before, which is our body [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=468.52s)]
*  has trained itself to basically tolerate certain proteins that it generates and not develop [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=473.62s)]
*  an immune response to it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  And so our trick is how do you flip that switch and break it anyway? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's where we trick the body into triggering that B cell activation. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=484.5s)]
*  So we've been able to do those things, which have allowed us to be more effective as a [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=489.02000000000004s)]
*  vaccine approach than others. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  The second comparison is often to traditional biologics, like monoclonal antibodies. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=496.70000000000005s)]
*  And really the big difference is monoclonal antibodies, they're manufactured in a giant [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=502.54s)]
*  vat externally someplace and then injected into patients. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=506.78s)]
*  As a result, they're very expensive, they're very complicated, and there's limited number [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=510.74s)]
*  of people that they can treat. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=515.52s)]
*  And so our whole approach is antithetical to that and trying to basically democratize [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=517.42s)]
*  biologics by getting your body to be that bioreactor. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=523.46s)]
*  You know, we're in the clinic right now. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=527.38s)]
*  We've kind of validated our platform technology, but that's really the main areas where we've [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=529.18s)]
*  been able to overcome, where other people have had challenges. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=534.14s)]
*  Without giving any secrets away, how does the vaccine platform work? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=538.3s)]
*  So I like to use analogies. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=542.66s)]
*  So it's like a sheep in wolf's clothing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  So if you present a sheep to a shepherd, it's not going to attack it because it's like, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=547.18s)]
*  oh, it's part of my herd. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=552.62s)]
*  So what we do is with our epitope design, with our vaccine design, we put just a little [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=554.02s)]
*  bit of wolf's clothing on the sheep. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=559.0799999999999s)]
*  So we take an epitope that looks like self and we make it have a motif that looks foreign. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=561.54s)]
*  So like measles or tetanus, something that our body recognizes as something foreign and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=569.92s)]
*  that needs to mount the immune response to. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=573.8199999999999s)]
*  So really what we do is we may dress the sheep with a wolf's head and that'll trigger parts [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=576.66s)]
*  of the shepherd to say, hey, I got to get on alert. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=581.8199999999999s)]
*  Maybe I get my dogs ready. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  And then I mount an attack to protect my herd. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=585.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we do with the immune system. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=589.14s)]
*  So we take something like amyloid and we attach it to something that looks like measles and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=591.14s)]
*  that gets the body tricked, one arm of the immune system activated, and it sends a signal [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=596.42s)]
*  to the other part of the immune system to say like, hey, let's produce antibodies. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=601.66s)]
*  Let's get our defenses up. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=604.86s)]
*  So that in a nutshell is kind of how our technology works. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  Is it synthetic peptides that you're working with? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=611.1s)]
*  Does that make it more scalable? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=613.5s)]
*  It's definitely part of it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=616.98s)]
*  So the synthetic part makes it, it's more like a chemical process. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=617.98s)]
*  So it's more stable manufacturing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=621.4s)]
*  It's very scalable manufacturing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=623.3000000000001s)]
*  The other part that makes it scalable is the mere fact that it's a vaccine versus a passive [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=625.4s)]
*  immunotherapy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=629.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=630.86s)]
*  And as a result, you use much less actual drug material per dose per patient. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=631.86s)]
*  So all in all, we're probably a hundred times or even a thousand times less expensive as [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=637.94s)]
*  a cost of goods per patient. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=643.3800000000001s)]
*  And as a result, it's also just much more scalable. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=645.98s)]
*  Like you can see with vaccines, again, you can produce billions of doses a year, whereas [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=649.2600000000001s)]
*  a passive immunotherapy, you're probably treating a million folks at most. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=653.82s)]
*  And what about addressing safety, which is obviously important? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  It's critical and it's ironic. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=663.2600000000001s)]
*  I have a thing that I tell my kids and everyone is like, everything happens for a reason. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=664.98s)]
*  And so one of the keys to safety with developing a vaccine or active immunotherapy for chronic [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=671.02s)]
*  diseases is you want to make sure that it's reversible. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=675.76s)]
*  So you can really control the antibody response. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=679.58s)]
*  So with our technology, it's always reversible. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=682.54s)]
*  It's not a permanent immune response. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=685.84s)]
*  So if you want to keep antibody levels up, you have to reboost. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  So you have to boost with a vaccine on an annual basis, maybe on a quarterly basis. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=691.46s)]
*  It just depends on the disease. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=696.58s)]
*  The irony is that when we first got into this business, we were really quite disappointed [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=698.5s)]
*  that we couldn't get a more robust permanent immune response. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=703.3000000000001s)]
*  And we're like, why can't we get it for years and years? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=707.58s)]
*  And everything happens for a reason. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=710.4200000000001s)]
*  And in fact, it is a safety blessing that everything comes down and reverts to normal [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=712.4200000000001s)]
*  in the absence of the vaccine. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=717.58s)]
*  So that's a key feature. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=719.7s)]
*  It's quite different what you're doing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  Sometimes that can be met with suspicion, sometimes with great excitement. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=725.46s)]
*  What's the reaction been like to what you're doing? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=730.26s)]
*  Oh, it's both. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=733.0600000000001s)]
*  Anytime you're pioneering something, it's got to be, you know, if it's not half terrifying [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=734.62s)]
*  and half thrilling, it's, you know, you're not doing it right. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=738.5s)]
*  So of course, whenever you're trying to do something that's different, there's going [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=741.62s)]
*  to be different reactions, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=745.26s)]
*  The promise of it is super exciting. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=747.98s)]
*  And the challenge of it makes it very skeptical. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=750.6600000000001s)]
*  It's like, can we really do this? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=753.62s)]
*  This is, I think, the same thing when people think of AI or anything new. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=755.74s)]
*  So we've just been methodically de-risking the platform and our program step by step [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=761.1800000000001s)]
*  and showing folks with data that it can be done and that not only that it can be done, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=767.5400000000001s)]
*  but that it is getting done. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=772.98s)]
*  And so as you get each de-risking step over with, it gets more and more excitement. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=774.62s)]
*  So it's definitely a bit of both. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=780.82s)]
*  And what diseases are you tackling? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=783.9s)]
*  Oh, you know, I'd say we're going after the low hanging fruit, but those are pretty large. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=786.58s)]
*  So we're going after the big ones like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, hypocalastremia. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=791.78s)]
*  These are the largest killers in the world. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=798.26s)]
*  You know, I like hypocalastremia as an example to talk about because heart disease is still [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=800.86s)]
*  the number one killer in the world everywhere, including in the developing world. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=805.34s)]
*  For the first time in history, chronic diseases are killing us more than everything external [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=809.86s)]
*  combined, even in the developing countries. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=813.98s)]
*  And so that just highlights the need for really scalable and accessible technologies. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=818.0600000000001s)]
*  The tragedy of that is that we know how to prevent most of heart disease, right? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=823.42s)]
*  You lower cholesterol and you keep it lower. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=827.82s)]
*  The problem is that we don't have the medicines that either folks are compliant with or that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=830.18s)]
*  folks have access to. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=836.42s)]
*  And so that's the challenge. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=838.02s)]
*  And so that's really one of the reasons why we're tackling it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=839.66s)]
*  The biology is de-risked because we know it works. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=842.9799999999999s)]
*  So now we just have to go in with a new approach that can be not only shown to be achieve a [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=846.18s)]
*  proof of concept, but then be scaled to everyone. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=850.7399999999999s)]
*  What's your pipeline look like in terms of tackling these different conditions? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=854.2199999999999s)]
*  So we have a number of assets in the clinic. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=859.66s)]
*  The one that's furthest along is our anti-aggregated amyloid vaccine for Alzheimer's that's finished [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=862.06s)]
*  two stages of trials now. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=868.86s)]
*  The next one is for Parkinson's. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=870.9s)]
*  So that one is in the clinic as well. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=873.3199999999999s)]
*  We just finished part B in Parkinson's patients of that program that's called UB312. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=875.5s)]
*  And I think we'll be presenting data in the new year. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=880.38s)]
*  We also have two other programs, one for migraine and the other one for hypocalesterolemia. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=883.86s)]
*  And the hypocalesterolemia one called VAX 401 should be reading out sometime in the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=889.74s)]
*  first half of next year. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=893.62s)]
*  So there's a lot of data, a lot of progress in the clinic. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=895.22s)]
*  And really what we're showing is one, the platform works. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=899.38s)]
*  We're able to break immune tolerance and get virtually everyone to generate antibodies [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=902.86s)]
*  against self antigens. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=908.46s)]
*  So that's awesome. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=910.46s)]
*  And the second is we've proved up the mechanism of action. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=911.46s)]
*  And we did that most recently in our Parkinson's study, which means that not only can we break [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=914.86s)]
*  immune tolerance, those antibodies are getting across the blood brain barrier where they [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=918.66s)]
*  need to be. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=922.86s)]
*  And then they're engaging in the target. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=923.86s)]
*  So they're actually neutralizing the target that we're going after. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=925.4599999999999s)]
*  So those are both pretty cool things. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=928.86s)]
*  Our next step is now showing proof of concept that we can find some clinical efficacy. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=931.18s)]
*  But again, this is this methodical de-risking and validating of our programs. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=935.78s)]
*  The delivery for this, is it just a one time thing or is it something that you have to [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=940.9s)]
*  re-administer periodically? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=945.78s)]
*  It has to be boosted. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=947.86s)]
*  And again, we like that because it's good for safety, just in case anyone doesn't want [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=949.38s)]
*  it anymore. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=953.82s)]
*  We don't want an immune response that we can't manage. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=955.34s)]
*  So like a permanent immune response that we can't turn off. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=959.58s)]
*  So classically, there's a priming regimen, just like you get boosted, you get primed [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=962.36s)]
*  with a COVID vaccine twice, you have to get primed with our vaccine three times. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=966.74s)]
*  And then after that, you get boosted. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=970.58s)]
*  And the frequency depends on the disease that we're talking about. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=972.54s)]
*  And are you looking to management or turning the clock back and curing? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=976.26s)]
*  So I'd add one in there also, which would be preventing in the first place. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=981.5400000000001s)]
*  So we definitely look to manage the disease. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=985.62s)]
*  So once someone already has or early signs of Alzheimer's, that would be a stage of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=987.6600000000001s)]
*  intervention, in which case we would look to slow the decline of the disease or like [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=992.5s)]
*  stabilize patients. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=997.1s)]
*  But more importantly, and maybe more impactfully, and this is the dream of a vaccine of an active [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=999.26s)]
*  immunotherapy, is to prevent it in the first place. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1005.06s)]
*  So imagine, just like we give our children MMR vaccines or the chickenpox vaccine so [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1008.26s)]
*  that our kids no longer get chickenpox in the first place. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1014.8599999999999s)]
*  Imagine being able to go and get an Alzheimer's vaccine when you're 40, 50, or when you show [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1018.9799999999999s)]
*  in your blood that you're starting to have these proteins accumulate. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1025.78s)]
*  When you start getting immunized so that even though you would have maybe gotten Alzheimer's [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1029.38s)]
*  at 60, 70, you're now pushing away so you don't get until you're 100 or you die of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1035.0600000000002s)]
*  something else. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1040.1000000000001s)]
*  That's the idea. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1041.1000000000001s)]
*  I think that's where the true impact of vaccines, that's where our life expectancy has basically [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1042.1000000000001s)]
*  doubled in the last century or so. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1047.0600000000002s)]
*  And a big part of it has been our immunization processes. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1049.7800000000002s)]
*  So I think that's where we could only dream and that's where we envision ultimately going. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1053.42s)]
*  Multiple vaccinations for multiple conditions maybe? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1058.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think we have really robust childhood immunization now and now what we're looking [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1062.42s)]
*  for is healthy aging, right? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1067.74s)]
*  Vaccinating for healthy aging. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1071.22s)]
*  Good to be able to attack this before it happens rather than having to intervene and manage [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1072.82s)]
*  something because clearly there are many diseases where once you reach a certain stage, no amount [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1078.42s)]
*  of intervention is going to make much difference. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1083.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1086.26s)]
*  I remember a man had a great quote at the risk of butchering. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1087.26s)]
*  It was something like, you know, smart people solve problems, geniuses prevent them. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1089.3799999999999s)]
*  So if we can prevent the problem from happening in the first place, we're much better off. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1093.14s)]
*  You mentioned the conditions that you're applying this to. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1097.2s)]
*  Would it apply to other conditions as well that you aren't tackling it? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1100.66s)]
*  Yeah, it absolutely could. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1105.46s)]
*  So we have a whole list. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1107.42s)]
*  The beauty of the technology is it can go after almost any target that's accessible [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1108.62s)]
*  by an antibody. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1112.82s)]
*  So there are hundreds of antibodies that have been approved and have validated biologies [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1114.78s)]
*  already. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1119.1s)]
*  One of the challenges is that one can never be rarely used in combination with each other, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1120.1s)]
*  right, because it's so expensive. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1124.8999999999999s)]
*  So one benefit of vaccines is you can go after multiple targets at the same time. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1126.54s)]
*  So you could go after high cholesterol, hypertension, you know, all in the same vaccine candidate. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1131.54s)]
*  You know, one of the things that we're looking at is there are all these other targets for [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1138.3s)]
*  diabetes, you know, for other immunological disorders, for allergy. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1142.06s)]
*  These are all things that could be gone after, you know, with our platform. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1146.54s)]
*  And it would be very interesting to imagine if you could prevent frailty of bones or muscle [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1150.82s)]
*  loss. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1157.46s)]
*  One of the most popular classes of drugs now is, you know, for obesity, just for that reason, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1158.84s)]
*  and diabetes. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1163.6599999999999s)]
*  So there are many, many indications that we can go after. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1164.82s)]
*  And what we're, or our pipeline right now is just the beginning. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1168.1799999999998s)]
*  You can't do everything at once, even though that would be nice. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1171.98s)]
*  Especially if you're a small company, we have to pick and choose our battles. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1175.74s)]
*  But just to give you an idea, like right now, vaccines are mostly against infectious diseases. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1179.26s)]
*  And there are limited number of targets that are really important to go after. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1185.06s)]
*  If you could apply the same technology, but to all chronic diseases, you're talking about [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1189.1s)]
*  being able to expand your pipeline by 40 or 50 times. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1193.06s)]
*  So these are pipelines for decades that has the potential to address. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  Does that mean that as a company, you may have to or want to look into licensing or [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1202.2s)]
*  partnerships with other companies? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1208.32s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1210.1599999999999s)]
*  I think success always engages an ecosystem. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1211.32s)]
*  And so our goal is to treat as an impact as many people as possible. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1215.12s)]
*  And that very well may mean partnering with other companies that are aligned with what [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  we're doing to help really reach more people ultimately. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1226.16s)]
*  So what are the next steps for the company? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1229.64s)]
*  Actually, it's to find partners to help take particular lead assets forward. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1233.3200000000002s)]
*  The most advanced ones being our neurodegenerative diseases in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1237.92s)]
*  We do have a COVID vaccine that has beautiful clinical trial data that's now going through [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1243.4s)]
*  the registration process. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1248.1200000000001s)]
*  So even though it doesn't feel like the pandemic, there are still a lot of people that are suffering [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1249.72s)]
*  from COVID. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1254.0800000000002s)]
*  We're looking to launch that in the low and middle income countries and the developing [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1255.24s)]
*  world. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1259.0s)]
*  And then we're going to see how our next data reads out. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1260.0s)]
*  So really progressing the pipeline forward through strategic partnerships, through commercialization [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  and through good old fashioned data. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1267.72s)]
*  When do you expect to have, obviously, you're doing different trials, but when do you expect [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1270.52s)]
*  to start seeing some of the data from those? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  Next year, first half of next year is going to be a very busy time. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1278.0s)]
*  We like busy because it means that stuff's happening and that's exciting. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1280.96s)]
*  And you can't be exact, obviously, but what kind of timelines are you looking at to being [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1284.04s)]
*  able to roll some of this out so that it's positively impacting patients? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1288.3999999999999s)]
*  I think our COVID vaccine would be the first one. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1293.1599999999999s)]
*  Again, it's a different model, but it would be the first proof point for us as a company. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1295.1599999999999s)]
*  And so we look for that in 2024. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
*  How does that differ from currently commercially available vaccines? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1302.44s)]
*  It's the vaccine that I would give my family, right? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1306.84s)]
*  And mostly because of the safety and tolerability. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1309.28s)]
*  Our vaccine is peptide based, right? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1312.1599999999999s)]
*  It's got a protein, RBD protein also on it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1313.96s)]
*  But it's first of all, a different platform technology. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1317.16s)]
*  We went head to head against mRNA, ADNO and inactivated in a clinical study. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1319.72s)]
*  And we showed that we were better than most of them on antibody generation and number [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1324.96s)]
*  of people who developed antibodies. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1330.8400000000001s)]
*  And really interestingly, it has a really beautiful tolerability profile. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1333.2s)]
*  You don't get sick in the same way. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1336.64s)]
*  Sometimes some of my friends were laid out for days after they got the booster vaccination. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1338.64s)]
*  What we want to be is as gentle as possible while still being effective, particularly [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1343.48s)]
*  against the new variants. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1347.96s)]
*  So I think that's going to be a big differentiator. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1349.72s)]
*  And so it's basically an mRNA alternative that is safe and friendly. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1352.2s)]
*  That's how I'd classify it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  Would it be the same as the other ones that you have to give a booster? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1358.56s)]
*  Yeah, this would be a booster. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1361.72s)]
*  In fact, the label that we're going after would be a heterologous booster. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1363.52s)]
*  So if you had been vaccinated previously with any mRNA or like an AZ or J&J or an activated [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1366.52s)]
*  vaccine, you could then get boosted with our vaccine. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1373.6s)]
*  It's pretty broad label. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1376.6399999999999s)]
*  So we try to cover a lot of people. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1377.98s)]
*  It's part of our tenant. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1379.52s)]
*  With something like this, because COVID has kind of faded into the background, obviously [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1380.6s)]
*  there are still new variants. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1386.0s)]
*  Do you have to constantly evolve your own products to take care of the variants or does [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1388.36s)]
*  it take care of that? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1393.72s)]
*  We have to see. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1395.32s)]
*  We've tested against all sorts of variants, right? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1396.36s)]
*  Everywhere from alpha, beta, gamma, delta, Omicron, Omicron, you know, numbers of Omicron. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1398.56s)]
*  And one of the unique aspects is we don't go after the entire spike protein. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1404.7199999999998s)]
*  We only go after the RBD, which is the more conserved region. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1408.56s)]
*  And so we actually do very well against the variants, particularly compared to our competitors. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1412.02s)]
*  And so right now, our plan is not to do like an every year variation, but really to see [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1418.6799999999998s)]
*  how our booster keeps up against the new variants. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1424.46s)]
*  So thus far, it's all right. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1429.0600000000002s)]
*  But again, we just stay close to the data and see how it continues. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1430.94s)]
*  Seems that you're looking to or going to be able to make a huge difference in the future. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1434.38s)]
*  So that's always good news. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1438.42s)]
*  This is what we're here for. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1439.98s)]
*  You know, we all have a choice of what we want to wake up and do. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1441.22s)]
*  So I'm privileged to wake up and have a pretty large mission that feels very purposeful. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1444.3000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you wanted to? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1448.7800000000002s)]
*  You know, you're an awesome conversationalist. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1452.38s)]
*  So we covered a lot of cool topics. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1454.38s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, I did a decent enough job in explaining how it works and why it [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1456.42s)]
*  really will be transformative. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1461.5400000000002s)]
*  I love what we're doing. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1463.2600000000002s)]
*  It's going to have a tremendous impact and we will get it done. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1464.5s)]
*  I won't know exactly how it gets done. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1467.18s)]
*  The only way to fail is to give up and we just keep going. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1469.42s)]
*  Our mission, our destination is clear. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1473.5200000000002s)]
*  The journey is the fun part. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1475.2800000000002s)]
*  So definitely another interesting company doing groundbreaking work and let's hope [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1476.7s)]
*  their products are making a difference globally in the very near future. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1487.5s)]
*  Definitely keep an eye or an ear out for the company over the next few years. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1492.5800000000002s)]
*  The company is Vaccinity and that's with two X's. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1497.9s)]
*  When I say two X's it makes it sound like a third marriage. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1502.06s)]
*  As it's the last podcast until the new year, maybe if you're missing it, there's an opportunity [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFShrver6s&t=1505.58s)]
