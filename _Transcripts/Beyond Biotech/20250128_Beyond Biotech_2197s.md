Video Description: There are many questions when it comes to setting up a biotech company, and raising funds. 

Currently, many companies are concerned about fundraising, but there are things that can be done to maximize efforts. Does a company’s location affect fundraising? What is the best approach to successfully raise funds? What are the current trends in biotech funding?


To look at questions surrounding the state of European biotech funding, and how it compares with the global scene, intellectual property, and how to challenge the status quo, we have a conversation with Dima Kuzmin, managing partner at 4BIO Capital.


4BIO is an international venture capital firm unlocking the treatments of the future by investing in advanced therapies and other emerging technologies.


00:45-02:36: About 4BIO
02:36-07:39: What are the trends in biotech investments currently?
07:39-09:30: Is being in a well-known biotech hub necessary to raise funds?
09:30-14:14: Is relocation necessary for companies starting up if they aren’t near a biotech hub?
14:14-17:57: What differences are there in investment patterns between Europe, the US and Asia?
17:57-21:35: How can funding match the research strength there is in Europe?
21:35-25:07: Are there any emerging hubs in Europe, or opportunities to create new hubs?
25:07-26:36: Are Spain and Italy good locations for biotech?
26:36-28:32: What are the best ways for European companies to attract US and Asian capital?
28:32-35:47: How do you see the European biotech space evolving?

# Challenging the European biotech funding status quo
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 106. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTech. This week, now that we're back after a couple of weeks [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=18.04s)]
*  off, our conversation is a wide-ranging one on the state of European biotech companies, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=23.96s)]
*  funding, intellectual property, and how to challenge the status quo. To tackle these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=29.8s)]
*  fascinating subjects, we turned to Dima Kuzmin, managing partner at ForBio Capital. I wonder [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=37.28s)]
*  if you could give me a bit of background on ForBio Capital. Sure, we are an early stage [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=46.44s)]
*  venture creation and venture investment firm based in London. We're regulated by the UKFCA [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=51.96s)]
*  and the USHCC. We invest broadly across all advanced and emerging modalities. So our five [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  key focus areas, technological areas are gene therapy, gene editing, cell therapy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=66.88s)]
*  RNA therapies, targeted therapies, and microbiome therapies. We are therapeutic [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=72.88s)]
*  agnostics. So we are engineers. We're technology specialists rather than therapeutic area [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=79.36s)]
*  specialists. We create 40% of our companies from scratch and they're primarily spin outs [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  from European universities, but they can also be spin outs from other biotech companies or [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  from pharma. And we seed and series A the rest of the portfolio. We're not only leader, co-lead. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=96.88s)]
*  We are high conviction, high concentration. So we do 10 to 12 deals per fund. And we, because of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  that, tend to plant way above our weight in terms of our investment demands. And we always take [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=111.12s)]
*  governance positions. So we always take board seats. And we like to think of ourselves as [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  somewhat useful to our portfolio companies, with most of that usefulness coming from our expertise [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=122.48s)]
*  in preclinical research, CMC, and pharma interactions specific to this space, as well [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=128.48s)]
*  as clinical trial design. We are four partners and a team of 14 people spread across London, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=135.28s)]
*  Singapore, Tokyo, Boston, and Philadelphia. And we invest globally, as I said, with a focus on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Europe, as well as the underserved regions of the United States and Japan. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  I think one of the trends that we've seen over the last little while has been companies complaining [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=156.0s)]
*  about funding or the lack of it. What are you seeing as the trends in biotech investment right [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=162.56s)]
*  now? I would agree with that. I think the challenge is that the fundraising cadence of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=168.48s)]
*  venture funds is much lower than the fundraising cadence of the venture backed companies. So when [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=176.72s)]
*  the cost of liquidity is high, and in particular, where the public markets are down in a meaningful [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=183.84s)]
*  way, as well as the private markets are down in a meaningful way, especially private equity markets, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  which do tend to be down in a high interest rate environment. This means that the limited partners, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  those who invest into funds have less money to allocate to their riskier strategies, which [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  typically includes venture capital, which means that for any given year, there is fewer dollars [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=206.4s)]
*  deployed into venture capital funds. Now, recall that an average venture fund raises a new fund [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=212.8s)]
*  once in every two to four years. If they're in Europe, like ourselves, more on the three year [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=218.96s)]
*  cadence, those in the US would be typically more on a two year cadence, though sometimes the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=224.4s)]
*  constant up would be more on the four year cadence. But anyway, this is a long time, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  a long process. And then of course, if you close a fund, then you can't add any more money to it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=235.28s)]
*  So those who close funds in a downturn, those funds tend to perform rather well down the line, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=241.04s)]
*  but they also tend to be smaller because the LPs had less money to allocate. And so for the venture [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=246.4s)]
*  funds, this is a situation that haves and have nots. Those who have really performed, and the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  larger managers find that relatively okay to fundraise. We are fairly small, fairly sizable [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=257.76s)]
*  now for Europe, but in the grand scheme of things as smaller investors. So for us, that makes it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=264.64s)]
*  more difficult. On the other hand, we have good performance, so that makes it easier. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=269.52s)]
*  So rate our fundraising environment as average to good. But for many firms that lack both the scale [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=273.44s)]
*  and the significant outperformance, so like top-desk outperformance, 2021, 22, and parts of 23 have [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=282.08s)]
*  been dismal to fundraise in. And as a result of that, there's meaningfully less doors in those [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=289.12s)]
*  firms. And also the largest firms also hold in less than they've expected. What this means is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=295.36s)]
*  there is systemically less capital available for biotechs, and that lasts a long time. Because if [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  you close the fund in 2021, the next time you go for a fund is maybe this year. So people are just [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=308.24s)]
*  now rebuilding their war chests to deploy more. And so whenever we have a decrease in the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=314.88s)]
*  availability of capital and biotech market, on the private side, it's much more sticky than on [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=320.64s)]
*  the public side and will last for a longer time. So my personal forecast is, and sharing it broadly, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=325.52s)]
*  that I think only by 2026, we'll have a reasonable chance of the private market improving really to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=331.84s)]
*  2021 levels. Although we do have, like many metrics, a strong recovery, but that strong recovery is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=339.44s)]
*  very uneven. So again, we have a situation of haves and have-nots, same as on the public markets. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=346.48s)]
*  Now haves are raising a lot of capital and finding it relatively, again, average to good to raise [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  capital. Whilst they have-nots, let's say your run-of-the-mill somewhat interesting European seed [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  startup, struggle a huge amount to raise their capital. So that's definitely a situation of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=364.88s)]
*  great disparity. And the other comment that I can add is Europe is historically systemically [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=370.64s)]
*  reliant on US capital. And this is both on the NLP layer and then the GP layer. So as public [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=378.32s)]
*  knowledge, we're based in London. We're one of the most prolific venture builders in Europe. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=386.08s)]
*  Our cornerstone investor are Children's Minnesota. They're based in Minneapolis and their healthcare [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=390.08s)]
*  endowment. We're immensely grateful to them for the backing, but that showcases the fact that most [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=394.48s)]
*  of our capital, as well as most of the capital for other kind of highly performing European funds, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  often comes from the US and sometimes from East Asia. So we're reliant on that. And we also enjoy [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=405.68s)]
*  the strategic backing of the Japanese sovereign investment bank, DBJ and others. But we are also [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  systemically reliant on the US funds to build the larger run of European companies. And that is very [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=419.68s)]
*  important because in a situation of a decreased availability of capital, the deals in the US become [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=427.36s)]
*  cheaper and the overall level of risk in the ecosystem increases. And so they naturally revert [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=432.8s)]
*  to backing their own home brew stuff. And so we've seen a significant pullback of US funds from [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=438.08s)]
*  funding European transactions over the past few years. It's been quite uneven, but it's generally [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=444.0s)]
*  lower than the 2020-21 levels. And as a result of that, we have a greater valuation disparity [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=449.28s)]
*  between Europe and the US from where we sit. You mentioned serving different parts of the world, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=456.55999999999995s)]
*  and you mentioned underserved parts of the US. Are there major geographical differences and is it [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=462.96s)]
*  necessary to kind of be in one of those well-known biotech hubs to be able to attract funding? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  I would call it necessary, but it's definitely more straightforward if your address starts with [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=477.92s)]
*  something candle square. So I would argue that Boston really is the hub and everything else, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  to an extent, is underserved. But the extent to which it is underserved, they differ and also [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=492.16s)]
*  it's not a static picture. So as I said, let's say London, Cambridge, Oxford, Baluations and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=498.72s)]
*  2021 were fairly comparable to the US or creeping ever closer. Now the gap is pretty wide again. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=505.04s)]
*  But also we've had very positive experiences. We have an exit in Michigan. Not many people can post [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=511.92s)]
*  that. We have been quite successful in Pennsylvania and so on. And we think there is an incredible [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=519.12s)]
*  amount of great innovation in the US outside the conventional hotspots of Boston and California. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=524.64s)]
*  But they're not very well served to capital. They lack the local funds and generally we see [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=531.28s)]
*  a great amount of opportunity and a fairly similar playbook anywhere where the production [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=537.52s)]
*  of intellectual property and real translational data is greater than either or both the availability [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=543.44s)]
*  of capital and the availability of corporate talent to take that data forward and turn it into [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=551.84s)]
*  products. And both are challenges. And both are challenges for Europe and both are challenges for [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=557.12s)]
*  East Asia and both are challenges for many regions in the US because Boston is a very strong magnet. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=563.76s)]
*  So what would that mean if then, for instance, you were mentioning the spin outs from a lot [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=569.92s)]
*  of universities? What would happen if, say, you were at, I don't know, Boise State University in [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=574.64s)]
*  Idaho and would you then have to kind of relocate when you started up? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=580.4s)]
*  People have done all sorts, really. Quite often it's about finding an entrepreneur that is in [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=586.48s)]
*  Boston or is in California or is plugged into their ecosystem. But this is kind of the first [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=593.2s)]
*  thing I'd worry about. The second thing I'd worry about is the degree. And this is not to demean in [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=599.76s)]
*  any way Boise, which is actually a very good place and I've been there. But it is quite often that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=605.6s)]
*  anyone in any regional ecosystem, be that Edinburgh or Boise or [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=611.6s)]
*  Nagoya or anywhere else, can have a somewhat limited view of what the world looks like. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=618.96s)]
*  They could have limited intelligence on what other people are doing by virtually being [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=624.72s)]
*  far away from the hotspot and not having the coffees in the end of the square. So [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=628.96s)]
*  as a result of that, they might be pursuing things that people have tried and failed at before, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=635.92s)]
*  or they might have a more advanced, better funded competitor who is kind of in stealth, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=643.12s)]
*  but anyone in Boston knows anyway. And that is a danger. And for an investor in a startup like [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=647.68s)]
*  that, and within licensed technology, we've built a very successful company, Ray Therapeutics, where [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=655.28s)]
*  we help the founding team, which is a spin-off from Wayne State University. I don't know if [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=662.8s)]
*  you've heard about Wayne State University before, but that's a fantastic research institution in [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  Michigan, but it's not a hotspot. But that company has now raised a hundred million dollars series A [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=673.04s)]
*  from noble, Deerfield, Norwest, Merck and Platonist. So although, yes, it moved to California in the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=679.68s)]
*  process. So the second thing you've got to worry about is, have I got the talent in Boise [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=686.8s)]
*  that I will need to put this forward? And if I don't, what kind of talent can I get virtually? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=692.56s)]
*  And then things can work out. We've seen successful startups continue to stay in one place for a long [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  time. But generally speaking, when we create companies and we create companies around [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  technologies coming out from very different places, we have a creation deal that we've incubated in [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=711.68s)]
*  our fund too, called EntypeBio, which has also raised a very large series A financing from [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=716.4799999999999s)]
*  Ben Bio, Shiving, At Bangor, Logosurveyor and Janice Anderson and $81 million series A. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=721.04s)]
*  And that originated in Sheffield in the United Kingdom and then it moved to Boston. So [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=729.04s)]
*  we are absolutely not averse to starting the company from really anywhere in the world where [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=736.56s)]
*  there is really good science and people are of good character. Now the question is then, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  where do we put it to make it an outstanding success? And what really guides us is the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=747.52s)]
*  availability of talent for that. And in my view, the availability of talent is uneven and it's [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=755.1199999999999s)]
*  really horses for horses. So if you'd ask me today, hey, Dima, where do I put my next gene [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=762.88s)]
*  therapy spin out? I say, put it in the UK, put it somewhere close to London, maybe in Cambridge, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  close to Siebenhage, depending on what the profile of people you want to attract. Because the UK's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=774.16s)]
*  got such a fantastic heritage of gene therapy exits. There are many people coming from Nightstar [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=778.32s)]
*  and Mira and Orchard and several others now have started their own companies or went on being CEOs [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=786.48s)]
*  or senior executives. And there are many consultants with great experience of pushing [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=794.16s)]
*  these to the clinic. So terrific. What I put in Boston? No, I put in the UK. On the other hand, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=798.88s)]
*  if you ask me, where do I put the greater company? I'd say, well, Boston seems like the most natural [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=805.28s)]
*  place to me. If you ask me, where do I put a company developing a really complex sophisticated [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=810.48s)]
*  biologic, maybe a really multifaceted cytokine, synthetic cytokine, or maybe an antibody or [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=816.24s)]
*  conjugate? I'd say, look at the Swiss ecosystem, look at Zurich Basel, because there are many sites [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=821.92s)]
*  that are absolutely terrific. And if you were really focused on developing a genetic medicines [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=826.72s)]
*  company, be that a gene therapy or an engineered cell therapy in the US as they go to Philadelphia, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=832.0s)]
*  this is where the real cell and gene ecosystem centers in the US. And this is where it comes from [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=838.24s)]
*  and this is where the core strength is. So courses for courses. But does it mean you get to stay in [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=844.8s)]
*  Boise? Not many times. What differences do you see in early stage investing patterns in Europe [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=851.68s)]
*  compared with the US and Asia? This will have to be heavily caveated because Europe, Asia and the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=858.8s)]
*  US are very large, all of them and very different internally. So if we go off the basis of the volume, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  the majority of the early stage deals and the majority of the market by spin out value in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=874.4799999999999s)]
*  Europe as the UK and Switzerland. Taken together, they capture anywhere between 60 and 70% of the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=879.2s)]
*  market. So volume builds experience. Experience builds comfort with risk. As a result of that, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=884.48s)]
*  you would normally find that the investor is based around those geographies or investing actively [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=892.48s)]
*  in those geographies. And in Europe, I would also add the Paris ecosystem and generally the French [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  ecosystem as another strong hub. Those based around those ecosystems have a greater risk [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=901.5200000000001s)]
*  tolerance and a greater understanding of what it takes to build a successful C stage company. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=907.6s)]
*  And then it perpetuates a cycle, right? Because they have a better risk tolerance, which means [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=913.36s)]
*  that they can single out higher risk, higher reward stories and guide them better. The other aspect [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=917.6s)]
*  is of course, the tech transfer offices. The more that the TTO is used to working with venture, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  the more deals they have, the better, stronger deal flow they have internally, the more experience [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=930.32s)]
*  they have negotiating the real deal terms. And therefore the easier it is to deal with them and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=935.76s)]
*  to build a company or to renegotiate a license. And of course, here again, the UK and Swiss TTOs [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  have vast amounts of experience, which makes it much easier to work with them than many others [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=945.76s)]
*  in Europe. There are of course also niche cases like Denmark, which is a very strong ecosystem, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=950.96s)]
*  which has very deep ties into novel and affiliated institutions. And of course, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=956.48s)]
*  then they have significant degrees of influence over that ecosystem. Whereas for example, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=960.96s)]
*  the British and Swiss ecosystems don't really have one actor exhorting us, you know, an outsized [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=965.76s)]
*  influence over them, despite the fact that both have two big pharma each. It's not like [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=970.88s)]
*  Noordensen and Roche rule the Swiss ecosystem. They don't. Actually, a lot of startup stuff [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=976.56s)]
*  happens that they don't even pop up, which is the healthy way of running an ecosystem. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=981.36s)]
*  Because of that, I would say that the more experience you get, the bigger the deal flow is, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=986.4s)]
*  the better risk tolerance becomes, the better pattern recognition becomes for all parties, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=990.48s)]
*  and the less friction there is in the ecosystem. As a result of that, the friction in ex-China, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=996.08s)]
*  Asia ecosystem, so Japan and South Korea, is exorbitantly high compared to the European and [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  the US ecosystem, because Japan has like below 100 deals a year in advanced biotech. And most of [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1008.4s)]
*  these deals are really limited in size and so on. So it's an excellent ecosystem, unbelievably high [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1014.96s)]
*  quality science. But the challenge there is, of course, building out of that science. And it's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1020.16s)]
*  a challenge for the local VCs, and it's a challenge for global VCs, and a challenge that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1025.68s)]
*  the government understands really well. The Japanese have taken some really concrete steps [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1029.12s)]
*  to improve the situation, which I think are commendable. And then the US, I think the real [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1033.92s)]
*  difference is the US is a very deep market, with a very large amount of investors with very different [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1038.8s)]
*  opinions. And so there, the craft of the CEO is much more finding a group of investors who are [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1045.84s)]
*  your long-term supporters, and who will be with you on that journey, who back the thesis. So you've [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1053.04s)]
*  got to just talk to a lot of people and figure out who likes the thesis. And this is much more about [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1058.48s)]
*  mental alignment, and quite often the mental alignment alone. I mean, a lot of people doing [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1063.1999999999998s)]
*  deals on that merit. Whereas in Europe, you kind of got to tickle boxes, and it's just a much harder [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1069.84s)]
*  experience often. There's a lot of IP being developed in Europe, probably more than can be [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1075.36s)]
*  funded and commercialized. How do we get that kind of into a bit more of a balance, so that the funding [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1081.9199999999998s)]
*  matches that research strength? As a matter of fact, Europe generates more IP than the US. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1088.8s)]
*  So it's an incredibly deep ecosystem, which is structurally and systemically underfunded. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  We definitely like the venture dollars and the growth dollars to really spread that ecosystem on. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1100.88s)]
*  It also doesn't help that the historic response to a lot of that has been grants. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  Grants are great, don't get me wrong, but they are not sustainable. And they also create a perverse [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1114.24s)]
*  business model, where rather than creating products, you're very keen on getting more grants. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1120.96s)]
*  And that replaces the incentive. So I think everything we know from the rise and fall of [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1125.36s)]
*  the planned economies is that the private markets tend to be quite efficient at picking the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1132.08s)]
*  optimal product market fit or picking out good products. And so to me, what really we need in [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1137.2s)]
*  Europe is more venture, significantly more venture. And this is not a pitch, hey, give me more money. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1143.12s)]
*  This is the pitch. This continent needs 50 more of me, right? Or rather not me, not an egomaniac, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1150.32s)]
*  but of my funds, right? So like 50 more for BIDO. There should be 50 more creation funds and seed [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1158.48s)]
*  funds and series A funds, maybe 100 more, right? I saw a tally that the US has close to 700 funds, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1165.04s)]
*  whereas Europe has somewhere 50 by specialized in life sciences. So this is the scale of the [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1171.68s)]
*  challenge. We need significantly more different firms doing different things. And then to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1177.2s)]
*  perpetuate the rising tide that will then flood all boats or flood the continent, right? So to me, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  the solution to that is to be able to deploy systemically more capital into the sector across [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1191.44s)]
*  the board into a variety of private managers. Because again, Europe has this tendency of trying [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1198.32s)]
*  to artificially catch up to the US champions and saying, oh, we're going to build our own [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1206.4s)]
*  deer field. Yeah, we're going to build our own. We are only interested in building the European [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1210.96s)]
*  champions. We're going to build multi-billion dollar firms. But the multi-billion, you don't [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1214.88s)]
*  build multi-billion dollar firms. Multi-billion dollar firms build themselves off the back of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1219.2s)]
*  performance, repeated performance and additional fuel that they can take on board after performing. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1223.92s)]
*  But for us, we perform and we have to go to the US for the fuel, which is challenging. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1230.96s)]
*  Because their first question is like, well, you guys are amazing. Why are you not here? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1236.64s)]
*  And for many people, if you look at many firms, the answer is, yeah, we might actually, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1241.3600000000001s)]
*  we should probably go, right? And there are some excellent European founders built amazing firms in [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1245.8400000000001s)]
*  the US. Equal one, Omega, who then kind of went back to Europe and others like unbelievably strong [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1250.72s)]
*  firms built by a region European founders, Western European, Eastern European. So the US is still, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1258.24s)]
*  to an extent, the shining beacon on the hill from the capital markets perspective. So how do we deal [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1264.64s)]
*  with this? Vastly more capital across the board. And I just want to underscore this again. This is [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  not a pitch for like, hey, you should back for buy more. This is a pitch for there should be many [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1275.1200000000001s)]
*  more for bios. There should be a better environment to build a new firm and easier environment to [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1279.2800000000002s)]
*  build a new firm. And then there should be significantly more capital for the firms across [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1284.64s)]
*  the board as long as they perform. And it needs to be performance based and to some extent strategy [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  based. What do you see as the, you've kind of touched on some of the current hubs in Europe. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1294.08s)]
*  Are there some emerging hubs in Europe and other opportunities for cities or regions to develop new [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1301.12s)]
*  hubs? I think there are always opportunities. I think it really takes on the one hand, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1308.24s)]
*  just persistence and repeated investment and hub building is actually a skill and it can be transferred. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  And we've seen that. And we know that the most important things about building hubs is geographical [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1325.84s)]
*  proximity of many different things in one kind of one hub, availability of capital and most importantly, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1331.6799999999998s)]
*  really strong training programs where people get to meet people from other walks of life [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1339.52s)]
*  and get into an industry that weren't really interested by that much before. So like think [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1347.84s)]
*  about Philly, the wardens MBA for the healthcare people had a tremendous impact. The cross [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1354.0s)]
*  discipline mentality of the MIT has had a tremendous impact as well as the willingness of the Harvard [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1362.16s)]
*  Medical School in most general to engage like very cross disciplinary programs and so on. So [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1368.48s)]
*  this is something that the university managers and hub managers can very well think of. And I know [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1374.32s)]
*  that there are efforts to think about that in other places in the world. So think about the emerging [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1379.2s)]
*  hubs globally, I would underscore Singapore is an emerging hub. They've put a lot of thought and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1383.84s)]
*  effort into that. And I know that's an ongoing process. Definitely Japan is very focused on [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1389.84s)]
*  building out Tokyo and Kyoto hubs and being very thoughtful about this, as well as other hubs in [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1395.84s)]
*  the country. And so far as Europe goes, I think there is a bit more of an organic effort, which [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1401.52s)]
*  is good. So I love organic, I think organic has a much better chance of winning because luck is one [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1406.72s)]
*  of the most powerful forces in the universe. And you got to see to so right so we and you got to [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1413.04s)]
*  see relatively broadly. But I'd say in terms of the emerging hubs in the UK, definitely Edinburgh, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  Manchester have been coming up Manchester more on the material side engineering and med tech side. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1425.12s)]
*  Edinburgh, the Institute for regeneration and repair, tremendous role in firm tree, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1431.28s)]
*  role in firm has been doing great things. We recently back to spin up from from there and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1436.2399999999998s)]
*  very, very, very strong ecosystem and definitely coming up as a hub. In Switzerland, we see great [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  hub building activity across Zurich and Basel, and with Basel launch and other things, and they're [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1448.6399999999999s)]
*  progressing well. And I really like what I'm seeing. And France also, of course, very strong [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1453.84s)]
*  effort around Paris. And in Denmark, kind of Denmark is all Denmark is a hub, but you know, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1461.1999999999998s)]
*  you've got classified Copenhagen, maybe or host an extent as parts of that. And the big gap on the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  map, which I would love to see more of and more in is Germany. And of course, Munich is [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1475.12s)]
*  trying to build itself more. And of course, many people around well, by Andex, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  been quite inspirational. So people have thought about mines, but generally I think still most [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1489.9199999999998s)]
*  people gravitate towards Munich. And that'd be great to see more happening there. And I know that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  influential and resourceful people are working on making that happen. And I wish them the very [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1500.4s)]
*  best. And we're trying to help as best we can. And you think of sort of all of the major European [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  economies, you think of Spain and Italy. Spain, I think is doing fairly OK. I think Barcelona's [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1511.44s)]
*  coming up and then Madrid's been generating things. I mean, of course, the CRG and other things [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1517.92s)]
*  have been performing well academically in Spain. San Sebastian is definitely a good hub for [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1524.8s)]
*  meetings and there's some fun space there. So I find that they're progressing well. In Italy, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1532.64s)]
*  I would say most of what we see is concentrated in the northwest. So in and around Milan [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1538.64s)]
*  and Ginoa, the Italian Institute of Advanced Technology and other hubs, San Raffaele in Milan, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1546.08s)]
*  which is a very strong gene therapy school. So things are definitely progressing, but we don't [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1553.6s)]
*  see an output equal to what we're even seeing in Germany. And actually an honorable shout out, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1558.9599999999998s)]
*  Poland and Czechia are progressing well. And we've started maybe even over the past couple of years [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1568.1599999999999s)]
*  seeing real, highly sophisticated Polish spin-ups, which is very, very good to see. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1575.84s)]
*  And I'm really stoked for what's to come because they have universities and high quality [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1583.6s)]
*  universities that have benefited from significant research funding. And if you build the base of [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1588.8s)]
*  the pyramid, build enough, things will come on. What would you say are the best ways to engage with [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1593.9199999999998s)]
*  US and Asian investors in Europe? By securing the backing of a very good European investor. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1599.6s)]
*  I would say that's the best way because otherwise everyone's bound to ask the question, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1607.28s)]
*  why isn't anyone local backing you? And that's kind of my first question when I get a Boston deal. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1612.56s)]
*  As it has been on every desk in Boston, I'll go to my desk, which is the opposite. And sometimes [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1618.72s)]
*  the answer is yes. And maybe the risk capital, my risk capital is different to their risk capital. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1624.48s)]
*  I'm going to do that deal, but I've not done that before. And so normally you need some kind of [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1629.12s)]
*  sample approval and your energy is typically better invested in your local funds. At the start, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1634.96s)]
*  with a couple of important caveats. One, there are diseases or areas which are significantly [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1642.96s)]
*  more meaningful to people in one part of the world than another. There are some Asia, fairly [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1649.44s)]
*  Asian impactful diseases where people in Asia are prepared to invest in. Same for the US. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1654.08s)]
*  And the other important caveat is if your technology is more than a tech biocide, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1659.84s)]
*  so you are developing a tool or diagnostic or anything related to computations and so on, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1666.64s)]
*  you typically stand a much better chance of raising capital from tech funds. And as a result of that, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1674.5600000000002s)]
*  you should also invest in going to US tech funds because they are large and do business properly [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1679.92s)]
*  and many of them have presence in Europe. And so to them, you're kind of local anyway. So that's an [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1686.24s)]
*  important consideration. But other than that, normally you would find people in the venture [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1693.84s)]
*  ecosystem generous with introductions. So if anyone comes to me and asks, hey, Dima, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1698.9599999999998s)]
*  can you introduce me to this Japanese fund? I'd normally be happy to do it as long as it's a [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1705.6799999999998s)]
*  reasonable story. You've given a really great overview of what's happening right now. How do [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1711.04s)]
*  you see that European biotech space evolving? And I know you can't guarantee any of this. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1717.28s)]
*  Look, I'm super excited for Europe. I think we are in a very good place. I think we have incredible [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1724.0s)]
*  research, which is the most important thing. We have incredible talent with people, with world [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1730.56s)]
*  experiences of approvals and exits. Nothing stimulates spin out creation more than a professor [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1737.92s)]
*  coming to work in the Ferrari. And we've had some of that. We had some of that. And that's great to [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1746.0s)]
*  see. Obviously not the scale of like the Moderna exits where people have been funding entire [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1752.64s)]
*  institutes, which really drives the ambition. But I've seen a really meaningful change in terms of [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1757.28s)]
*  how European, especially UK ends with academics think of translation over the past five, seven [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1764.48s)]
*  years based on the wave of the IPOs and trade sales that we've had. And this means that for the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1773.28s)]
*  first time ever in this advanced adept therapeutics and more broadly in Europe, we have a self turning [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1780.6399999999999s)]
*  ecosystem. We have people who have been successful founders or co-founders who then get bitten by the [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1789.2s)]
*  bug. They have an exit and they go on and do an ex-company. And that's excellent. That's what we need. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1796.24s)]
*  So I think the next, I wouldn't go as far as say, oh, the next decade will be the European decade. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1802.72s)]
*  No, it's not going to be European decade. So still the US, I think for a long time will dominate this [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1807.2s)]
*  market because they have so much momentum and so much capital. But if you ask me if Europe is going [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  up in terms of funds, quality of biotech, quality of management, quality of the translational signs [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  that we have, 100% we're going up. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about that we [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1824.8000000000002s)]
*  haven't? I would probably just try and reinforce one point. And that is that if Europe thinks, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1830.4s)]
*  and I mean, Europe is a very abacus word here because many different political actors, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1839.68s)]
*  but let's say if the five largest European economies, such as the UK and Switzerland, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1845.0400000000002s)]
*  France, Germany, and so on, so think that life science is a pivotal sector. And this is what [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1850.0s)]
*  the future prosperity of the continent will in part at least rely on. They should really put [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1856.4s)]
*  their money and their legislative will where their mouth is. And I'm saying legislative will [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1862.8000000000002s)]
*  will likely be more challenging than the money because handouts are kind of natural and they [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1871.76s)]
*  come naturally to especially left-leaning governments, but also lately to the right-leaning [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1877.6000000000001s)]
*  governments across the continent. But what we really need is a systemic legislative support for [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1881.84s)]
*  the sector, right? And this comes through things like tax breaks and R&D tax credits and simplifying [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1888.56s)]
*  legislation and regulation, simplifying hiring, simplifying cross-border collaboration, simplifying [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1896.8s)]
*  talent visas for people from the subsector to ease them coming from other parts, really considering [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1903.1999999999998s)]
*  the strategic aspects of working with other parts of the world and the implications both for [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1910.88s)]
*  IP theft and copying, which is on the other hand, but on the other hand, taking advantage of the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1916.24s)]
*  innovation happening in other regions and bringing that into Europe, right? And biotech's, I think, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1921.8400000000001s)]
*  been a very interesting case study here because they've kind of led the way in licensing products [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1928.24s)]
*  and acquiring stuff out of China. And this is a completely novel way of thinking. We've been so [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1933.0400000000002s)]
*  preoccupied by stopping the leak of our intellectual property to China that whenever a partner says, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1938.24s)]
*  is there anything we should actually buy there? They're developing very smart products where we [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1945.2s)]
*  should be buying their companies as well as they are buying our companies and it should be a mutual [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1949.2s)]
*  process. And so to me, this is really about the will to push forward on increasing the cohesion, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1953.52s)]
*  right? And cohesion can systemically be increased by removing friction from this industry, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1962.16s)]
*  making their less rich. And what I'm seeing systemically is more friction, right? And to [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1967.92s)]
*  showcase, for example, what concerns me, and I've been talking about this, what concerns me [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1974.16s)]
*  currently in the UK is that the Labour government and many great things that they're promising to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  do and we're very hopeful are also planning to increase taxation of carried interest, which would [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1984.5600000000002s)]
*  punish the venture funds alongside private equity funds. This could cause some of the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1991.3600000000001s)]
*  venture investors to pull back from the country, which would be detrimental for the UK. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=1996.88s)]
*  In addition to that, there are several ways that R&D credits have been treated across the [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2000.5600000000002s)]
*  continent by different countries, which are more towards reshoring or re-initialisation. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2005.7600000000002s)]
*  Like you can only claim them back on the local expenditure, which is great. But I fully support [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2011.2s)]
*  the good and tend to be on that. But the reality is that it's a global sector and there is a very [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2018.16s)]
*  great chance that if you're a biosec in the Netherlands, you still need to rely on the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2023.52s)]
*  service provider in the UK, in the US and in China and Japan and somewhere else. And why wouldn't [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  you benefit from spending that to spur on research and then why wouldn't they benefit in relying on [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2033.44s)]
*  the Dutch service provider at the same time? So to me, I've seen for political reasons and [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2039.2s)]
*  partially economical reasons, some pullback from decreasing this friction and I would prefer there [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2046.1599999999999s)]
*  to be less friction. And very importantly to KVF, what I'm not talking about is making it easier to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2054.0s)]
*  approve drugs. So it's a very popular thing in the biopharmac world, back on the clinical regulators, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2061.2s)]
*  the FDAs and EMAs of the world. Maybe somewhat controversially, I actually think they're doing [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2067.2799999999997s)]
*  a great job. Their job is to make sure that patients get treated with safe and efficacious [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2072.32s)]
*  medicines that have a reasonable, statistically significant and very finely reproducible effect [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  and they're doing a great job. Yes, of course, there are always hiccups, but what we do not need [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2083.92s)]
*  is more snake holes on the market. That's the last thing that a venture and biotech industry need. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2089.52s)]
*  And so because of that, I think they're doing a great job. And similarly, the nicest of the world, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2094.96s)]
*  the price regulators are doing their best to safeguard the taxpayers' money and I'm not [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2100.32s)]
*  advocating for there being higher drug prices or whatever in order to pay for more innovation. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2104.8s)]
*  What I think we need to invest in is lower costs, lower marketing costs and so on to make these [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2110.2400000000002s)]
*  therapies more price efficient and more cost effective. That'd be great. But I just want to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lner2xIX1B0&t=2116.8s)]
