# MoonLake Immunotherapeutics’ Kristian Reich on how nanobodies will revolutionize immunotherapy
**Beyond Biotech:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Cassane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 143 for the podcast. This week I had the good luck to sit down with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=11.76s)]
*  Moonlake Chief Scientific Officer Christian Reich. Moonlake is a clinical stage company [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=18.22s)]
*  leveraging nanobody technology to develop medicines for immunologic diseases. Christian, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=24.34s)]
*  the co-founder of Moonlake alongside CEO Jorge Santos de Silva, has more than 25 years experience [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=30.38s)]
*  in dermatology and immunology and has been described as a global clinical leader in skin [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=37.32s)]
*  and immune disease. In our interview, he explains how he came to found Moonlake, how the company [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=42.94s)]
*  came to license a key molecule from Merck KGAA and the impact that their nanobody technology is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=49.5s)]
*  expected to have on patients in the near future. I hope you enjoy this discussion with Moonlake's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=55.56s)]
*  Christian Reich. So Christian, welcome to Beyond Biotech. Welcome Dylan. Maybe you can start by [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=61.64s)]
*  telling us a little bit about yourself. You've had 25 years of experience in dermatology, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=71.02s)]
*  immunology. What got you started in this field? Yeah, I love chronic inflammatory diseases. I have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  to say as an immunologist it's fascinating to think that one of the most delicate system we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=83.82s)]
*  have in our organism can give you health and needs to protect us against all these microbial [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=89.46s)]
*  pathogens that we live in. But on the other hand, that you see that exaggerations of certain immune [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  responses really drive chronic inflammatory diseases. And if you look at chronic skin diseases, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=101.18s)]
*  diseases like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, you have them in the gut, Crohn's disease, ulcerative [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=107.34s)]
*  colitis, we have rheumatological chronic inflammatory conditions. If you lump them all together, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=112.38000000000001s)]
*  that's, I don't know, a prevalence of 20-30%. So it's a very relevant proportion of the chronic [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=116.62s)]
*  diseases that human beings can suffer from. And they are obviously driven by something going wrong [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=123.26s)]
*  with the system that ultimately also has a very strong and important physiological function. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=128.94s)]
*  You saw all of those things as a clinical leader, as a clinician. But was there a particular moment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=134.78s)]
*  that inspired you to jump out of the practice and then move into co-founding Moon Lake? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=140.3s)]
*  Yeah, Dylan, I mean, what you can see, but the listeners cannot. I'm old, right? So I started in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=146.06s)]
*  medicine many, many years ago. And when I started in dermatology, Dylan, believe it or not, we had [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=151.42s)]
*  topical corticosteroid creams and tar and phototherapy. And it was a little bit frustrating. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=158.14s)]
*  So we had 200,000 names for 2000 diseases, but we had three treatments. I'm overdoing it a little [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=163.26s)]
*  bit, but not much. And then came the fantastic era where we began to understand our diseases. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  So suddenly I can say, wow, psoriasis, we have T cells in there. We know what activates these T [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=175.98s)]
*  cells. We know what mediators that these T cells make that probably drive the disease. And then [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=181.5s)]
*  came this fantastic moment. And that was not me, unfortunately, but where it became clear [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=187.34s)]
*  that we can manipulate antibodies to a molecule that all of us have, molecules that have a super [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=192.62s)]
*  high specificity and sensitivity, Dylan, in the sense that one antibody wants one and only one [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=198.38s)]
*  molecule only. Now imagine you suddenly can use this toolbox to create antibodies that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=204.06s)]
*  specifically inhibit these mediators. And that's exactly what happened more or less at the beginning [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=211.26s)]
*  of my career in dermatology. So suddenly we had these antibodies. We could inject people with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=216.22s)]
*  antibodies that would normalize these mediators that we had identified to drive the diseases. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=222.06s)]
*  And I take psoriasis as an example where patients were two, three months hospitalized every year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=228.14s)]
*  tar was put on their skin, they were getting some phototherapy, they would get better a little bit, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=234.3s)]
*  and then they would come back into the hospital. And suddenly we could inject one ml of an antibody [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  and half of the patients would clear. So I think I was lucky because at the beginning of my career, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=245.42s)]
*  and you said it, I'm an immunologist and dermatologist, but I saw this translational [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=251.82s)]
*  revolution, Dylan. I saw how our insights into immune mechanisms were converted using this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=255.98s)]
*  targeted therapy strategy into treatments that would completely change the way we could manage [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=263.26s)]
*  some of these important conditions. And that really got me going. So I did a lot of research, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  I participated in clinical trials, I think I can say I helped many of these targeted therapies [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=275.02s)]
*  to become reality. And then Dylan, at a very much later point in my life, suddenly there was an [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=280.7s)]
*  opportunity to look at a different kind of molecule I would call this targeted therapies 2.0. So no [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  longer we are now talking antibodies, we are talking nanobodies. And of course, having really [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  seen every day for many years how antibodies transform treatments, and now thinking that we [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=299.98s)]
*  have an opportunity to do what antibodies did just better with this nanobody, we could get in our [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=305.26s)]
*  hands. That for me was the real jumping point. Why don't you at the end of your career, why don't you [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=312.3s)]
*  now take this opportunity and all your knowledge and all the science and try to develop something [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=318.06s)]
*  that is even better than the targeted therapies we had before? What's interesting, and I'm sure [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=322.54s)]
*  it's going to come across to the listeners as well, is you seem still really excited about this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=328.3s)]
*  The science has still got you very excited. Dylan, I am still excited, right? This is not played. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=332.94s)]
*  And look, I have been a real physician, a real dermatologist for many, many, many years. I've [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=340.38s)]
*  seen thousands of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. Because we share some of our treatments [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=345.26s)]
*  with other specialties like rheumatology or gastroenterology, I'm also very aware of the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=351.5s)]
*  chronic inflammatory diseases that sit in these specialties. I still think that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=357.02s)]
*  these patients have an enormous amount of suffering. Think about it. Many patients, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=363.9s)]
*  I take against psoriasis as an example. It starts when you are 16 and you know that you have 60, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=368.14s)]
*  70 years ahead living with psoriasis. So every company and every doctor would say unmet need and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=374.38s)]
*  burden of disease. But I think I experience every day for many years of my life what it means to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=381.42s)]
*  have a chronic inflammatory condition. And just imagine, and also having a little science heart, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=387.82s)]
*  what it means that suddenly you have a completely new drug class in your hand. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=392.86s)]
*  And then an additional excitement, thinking that you may contribute to developing a new therapy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=396.62s)]
*  that kind of sits on the shoulders of these fantastic targeted therapies that we saw becoming [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=402.86s)]
*  reality in the last years. So why shouldn't you be excited? Have we solved our chronic inflammatory [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=408.06s)]
*  diseases? Can we cure them? Do we have treatments for all of these conditions that make 90% of the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=413.58s)]
*  patients 100% better? No. So there is still a lot to be discovered. And my excitement is driven by [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=420.38s)]
*  the thinking that with our nanobody, that with Sunilukima, we could do exactly this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=428.14s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about Moonlake Immunotherapeutics. What's it all about? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  What's the core mission? What gets your team out of bed in the morning? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=438.14s)]
*  So this is a company that is created around one molecule. You heard me talking about this before. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=442.94s)]
*  It is this nanobody Sunilukima. And I will explain in a minute what this molecule is. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=449.34s)]
*  There was a time some years ago when there was an opportunity to get full access, full rights, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=455.02s)]
*  the IP, the molecule, everything. It's coming from the German Merck. We were able to organize [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=461.34s)]
*  an exclusive license agreement with German Merck. And together with George Santos de Silva, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=468.21999999999997s)]
*  there was a famous moment at the airport in Frankfurt where we decided, wow, if we can get [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=474.06s)]
*  this molecule, let's go crazy. Let's leave our comfortable lives behind. Let's get the investors [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=478.94s)]
*  on board. Let's form a company. Let's develop the strategy. And this is what happened. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  You're focusing on a couple of very specific diseases in there and very serious diseases [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  as well. Is there a reason that you've chosen those specific inflammatory diseases? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=495.26s)]
*  There is a reason, Dylan. And to oversimplify, but just imagine the world of chronic inflammatory [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=501.9s)]
*  diseases as certain immune programs going wrong. You look at your washing machine, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=509.58s)]
*  I've been told that there are programs for silk and for cotton and 90 degrees and 100 degrees. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=515.34s)]
*  And similar to this, our immune system is able to pull off different programs, for example, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=521.4200000000001s)]
*  to defend against bacteria or fungal infections or viral infections or kilmolic cells. And all [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=528.14s)]
*  of these different programs, they have to be in balance. And today our understanding is that an [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=534.3000000000001s)]
*  exaggeration of certain of these immune programs drives certain chronic inflammatory conditions. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=540.3s)]
*  And that clearly is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases, Dylan, that are driven by too much of a [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=547.02s)]
*  cytokine pathway that is called interleukin 17. And there has been a lot of learning. We now know [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=552.78s)]
*  that it's not one cytokine. It's actually a family of cytokines, A, B, C, D, E, F. We know that two of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=559.74s)]
*  these family members, namely I have 17 A and F, they cooperate to drive a certain group of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=565.9s)]
*  chronic inflammatory diseases by forming dimers. Right. So you have an AA, an AF and an FF pair of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  these cytokines that drive diseases. Now, our nanobody blocks I-17A and I-17F. I think this was [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  one of these exciting initiating events that this is obviously an MOA, a mechanism of action [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=588.22s)]
*  that would allow us to better than before inhibit the I-17 pathways with a perspective to treat [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=595.66s)]
*  diseases that are driven by an exaggeration of this I-17 pathway better. Number two, Dylan, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=602.86s)]
*  antibodies are relatively large molecule. We measure the size in kilo Dalton to give you a [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  feel, a normally occurring antibody and all the therapeutic antibodies, they have around 150 kilo [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=615.18s)]
*  Dalton. Our nanobody has 40 kilo Dalton. So it's only 30% of the size. And there's good evidence [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=620.22s)]
*  that with smaller size comes a better tissue penetration. So Dylan, if you have a skin disease, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=627.1s)]
*  I inject you with a nanobody that's absorbed into the peripheral blood, but then it has to go where [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=633.02s)]
*  the inflammation sits, in this case, the skin. And we think that being smaller as a nanobody, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=638.3000000000001s)]
*  we have a better chance to get more of our peripheral blood molecules into the skin. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=644.62s)]
*  There's another advantage with our nanobody is actually built composed of three binding blocks. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=650.54s)]
*  With two of them, we block the two cytokines, I-17A and I-17F that I was talking about. With a third, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=659.1s)]
*  we bind to albumin. So a naturally occurring protein. This was introduced to prolong the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=665.02s)]
*  half-life to the two weeks that we have, allowing us very convenient monthly injections to keep [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=671.9s)]
*  diseases under control during maintenance therapy. But inflammation, Dylan, comes with an increased [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  permeability of blood vessels. And this increased permeability leads to something that doctors call [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=685.5799999999999s)]
*  edema. So fluid with albumin leaves the circulation and accumulates at the sites of inflammation. And [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=691.26s)]
*  guess what? And that's not rocket science, but if your molecule binds to albumin, what a traditional [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=699.02s)]
*  antibody cannot do, it should steer our molecule selectively to where the inflammation sits. So [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=704.22s)]
*  helps us to specifically enrich its sites of inflammation. So the molecule characteristics [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=711.34s)]
*  would indicate that we would be particularly working well, A, in diseases that are driven by I-17, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=716.78s)]
*  but B, in diseases where the inflammation is difficult to reach. And when we looked at [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=722.94s)]
*  chronic inflammatory conditions that are driven by 17 and that are underserved and where antibodies [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  have struggled, a chronic inflammatory disease called hydrodinitis suprativa came up as one [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=736.1400000000001s)]
*  important disease where all these particular characteristics are the reality. And this is why [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=742.86s)]
*  we picked hydrodinitis suprativa as one of the first big indications that we would go to. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=750.14s)]
*  Serapic arthritis is another one, a disease that sits in the skin, in the nails, in the joints, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=755.74s)]
*  in parts of the joints that we call the emthesis, so where tendons, ligaments, capsules insert into [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=762.22s)]
*  the bone. I would also call this difficult to reach site of inflammation. So if you think about it, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=768.06s)]
*  we did not pick our indications randomly, but they were carefully selected for making the most out of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=774.78s)]
*  the specific molecule characteristics that we have. And we continue this path. Also the new [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=781.74s)]
*  indications that we are looking at, I think they're all indications where you see this pattern. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=787.26s)]
*  You mentioned getting that molecule licensing deal from Merck KGAA. That's got to be a milestone [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=792.86s)]
*  in getting the company off the ground, but have there been other milestones that you can point [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=799.5s)]
*  to in the last couple of years, things that have really stood out and made Moon Lake [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=802.94s)]
*  bigger and better? Well, yeah, absolutely. I mean, the company was formed in 2021 and then 2022. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=807.1s)]
*  We went public, Dylan. We were all celebrating at Nasdaq, celebrating with a tear in the eye, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=814.46s)]
*  because not long before the Ukraine war had started. So the world had many question marks, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  but there we were in New York Times Square and going public with our company. That allowed us [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=828.06s)]
*  to raise a significant amount of money. We already had a phase two trial in psoriasis, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=834.54s)]
*  but this money allowed us to then go into the indications, hydrodendritic suprativa, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=841.5799999999999s)]
*  seratic arthritis that I was talking about. So that would be a second important milestone. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=845.9799999999999s)]
*  Going public in the third, Dylan was, and for me particularly exciting as the chief scientific [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=850.6999999999999s)]
*  officer of Moon Lake when we saw the first result in hydrodendritic suprativa. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=856.22s)]
*  The small size, the provincial accumulation of at sites of inflammation, the special way by which [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=861.4200000000001s)]
*  we block R17A and F. Dylan, this is all stories. Ultimately, you have to show that these stories [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=867.5s)]
*  convert into better outcomes, but that seemed to be the case. So there was a moment when we looked [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=873.26s)]
*  at the results of our big global phase two in hydrodendritic suprativa, and we could, I think, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=878.0600000000001s)]
*  really show a response that was so far unseen, unheard of. And back on the back of this data, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=882.78s)]
*  we were able to raise another $500 million, then allowing us to go into phase three. And as you're [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=889.3399999999999s)]
*  probably aware, so this would be my personal third big milestone, and as you're probably aware, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=897.74s)]
*  later this year, we will be able to talk about the phase three results in this indication and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=903.1s)]
*  discussing with the world the primary endpoint data really to prove if all these [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=909.9000000000001s)]
*  molecule characteristics, this great data in phase two, if this is now all culminating [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=915.9000000000001s)]
*  and replicated in phase three. Let's dive into a little bit of that science then, and maybe we'll [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=920.86s)]
*  start by just taking a step back. Assuming I know nothing about nanobodies, where can we start? What [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=927.58s)]
*  you've told me so far is that they're significantly smaller. So instead of 150, they're down to 40. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=934.06s)]
*  That comes with a name. What else makes them different to a traditional antibody? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=941.42s)]
*  Dylan, and I could clearly chat for two hours about these molecules. They were, I think, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=946.78s)]
*  discovered by serendipity. I had the chance to have dinner with a person, a Belgian scientist, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=951.26s)]
*  that actually discovered nanobodies, I believe. These are derived from antibodies that only have [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=958.22s)]
*  a heavy chain. You must understand that if I extract an antibody from your blood, Dylan, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=965.98s)]
*  I will find that it's composed of a heavy chain and a light chain, and the variable regions of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=971.34s)]
*  both these heavy and light chains, they ultimately dictate what specific target your antibody binds [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=977.02s)]
*  to. Now, I think this was in the times when there was the peak of the HIV crisis, and the students [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=983.1s)]
*  that were about to investigate immunoglobulins in human blood, they said, we don't want to work with [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=990.78s)]
*  human blood. So they opened the fridge and took out some camel blood, and they saw bands that they [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=995.58s)]
*  couldn't allocate to any known immunoglobulin band, and they could see, and then later it was [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1002.14s)]
*  discovered, there's not only camel, it's a charak, some other animals that really have antibodies that [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1008.7s)]
*  are different. They have no light chain. They only have a heavy chain, and it's this variable region [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1013.1s)]
*  of a heavy chain only antibody, Dylan, or a VHH that is really this nanobody. This is only 15 [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1019.26s)]
*  kilodalton, but one beauty of these nanobodies is that you can easily create multimeric molecules, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1026.94s)]
*  molecules that bind to different targets, and sonylocomab is a shining example. So ultimately, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1034.14s)]
*  if you really technically look at this, sonylocomab is covalently linking three of those nanobodies, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1039.66s)]
*  and this is where these three binding blocks come from. With two, again, we bind aseptin-ANF [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1046.5400000000002s)]
*  and with a third albumin. So this means nanobody, a variable region from a heavy chain, only antibody [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1052.6200000000001s)]
*  15 kd, sonylocomab, three nanobodies, if you will, covalently linked 40 kd, but still enjoying [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1059.6599999999999s)]
*  the advantages of the molecule that I was discussing earlier, including the smaller [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1068.1399999999999s)]
*  molecule size. You know, I love those serendipitous stories, and it just seems amazing to me that you [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1073.58s)]
*  could just open the door in a lab refrigerator, find something from a camel, a llama, you mentioned [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1080.3799999999999s)]
*  a shark as well. Was it really that simple, or is this just a story that we tell? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1085.82s)]
*  Of course, it's the story that we tell, right, and I'm sure that it was a lot more complicated, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1091.8999999999999s)]
*  but I think some crucial elements are really true, and Dylan, we just have to embrace that some of [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1095.98s)]
*  the key discoveries in human science, they are made by serendipity. And if you ask me, I think [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1100.9399999999998s)]
*  the era of nanobodies is just dawning. They are already used to be labelled and to help, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1107.18s)]
*  to help, for example, to diagnose certain malignant tissue in patients. They do this [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1115.42s)]
*  with a better tissue penetration, a lot better than antibodies. I can see that they are being [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1120.38s)]
*  used to create passive immunisation. There are, for example, nanobodies against the coronavirus [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1125.5800000000002s)]
*  underlying COVID-19, and they work a lot better than antibodies that you can give to possibly [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1133.0200000000002s)]
*  immunised patients. They seem to not only penetrate tissue better, it also seems that they bind [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1139.0200000000002s)]
*  certain epitopes in their target that are very special. I'll give you an example. Some tumors [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1146.0600000000002s)]
*  you can treat by blocking a growth receptor on these tumors by giving an antibody, right, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1152.7s)]
*  breast cancer, for example. But the tumors are unfortunately clever, and mutations will occur [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1158.7s)]
*  in these growth receptors, and then the antibodies no longer bind. Nanobodies against the same growth [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1163.58s)]
*  receptor still bind. So there seems to be also a reason why evolution has brought about nanobodies. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1169.1s)]
*  And of course, we would be very proud if we could take this present of nature to treat [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1176.62s)]
*  chronic inflammatory diseases better. Can you talk about what's actually happening at the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1183.58s)]
*  molecular level with these nanobodies, what they're doing to the patient? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1188.86s)]
*  Yeah, and let me do this very specifically for sonyloquimab, right. So just imagine, and then [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1194.54s)]
*  now I take hydradenitis suprativa. It's a terrible skin condition. It's one of those conditions that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1199.98s)]
*  start often in puberty or in early adulthood. Patients develop inflammatory nodules, inflammatory [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1205.74s)]
*  abscesses, very, very painful lesions in the skin. And because there's a lot of tissue destruction, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1211.9s)]
*  and the half-olicles, they rupture and scars form, and also tunnels. So structure that have aluminum [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1219.66s)]
*  that shouldn't exist suddenly form deep in the dermis. They fill with pus. These tunnels grow. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1228.5400000000002s)]
*  They can get access to the skin surface. And then really the pus is oozing out of your body. So you [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1235.42s)]
*  have painful inflammatory lesions that turn into irreversible scars. You have these tunnels forming. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1241.18s)]
*  There is an odor from the secreted pus. So it's clearly a disease that is very hard to see how [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1248.8600000000001s)]
*  you can lead a normal life with this, and the disease burden is massively. If you take affected [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1255.5800000000002s)]
*  tissue and you ask the question, which cytokines, which mediators are apparently and exaggeratedly [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1262.22s)]
*  expressed in these lesions, you find IL-17A and you do find IL-17F. And if you take certain target [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1270.22s)]
*  cells, keratinocytes, Dylan, these are cells that form the outer layer of your skin, they react to [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1277.82s)]
*  IL-17A and F. If you give a little sprinkle of IL-17A and F to keratinocytes, they make many [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1283.82s)]
*  mediators, and now it comes, that attract more immune cells into the skin. You see that IL-17A [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1289.98s)]
*  and F, they seem to be sitting in the middle of a vicious circle that can explain the extreme [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1296.86s)]
*  chronicity of the disease, that can explain the tissue destruction. Now just imagine what you now [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1302.9399999999998s)]
*  have to do is you have to block the biological activity of IL-17A and F. And ideally you do it [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1309.74s)]
*  by blocking these three dimers that I was talking about. So if you now come to me and I inject my [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1315.6599999999999s)]
*  nanobody, I will do it in your subcutaneous tissue, one ml. It's a short three, five second long [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1320.78s)]
*  injection, that's all. I will inject one ml in your subcutaneous tissue. From there it will be [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1328.22s)]
*  absorbed into the peripheral blood. From the peripheral blood it will go back into the tissue, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1333.58s)]
*  in the skin, where the inflammation sits, and it will bind to IL-17A and F so that these cytokines [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1339.82s)]
*  are inhibited. They're no longer biologically active. They can no longer activate keratidocides. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1346.86s)]
*  Keratidocides no longer make these mediators that bring more immune cells into the skin, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1352.2199999999998s)]
*  and thereby you can put a break into the inflammatory process. You can see the nodules, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1356.6999999999998s)]
*  the abscesses disappearing. We can see the tunnels stop draining. We cannot make tunnels immediately [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1362.3s)]
*  go away, but we can then make, we can make them stop draining. And then of course the symptoms also [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1369.02s)]
*  go away. The pain goes away. The patient can again go to the gym. So the idea is we need to have these [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1373.66s)]
*  molecules that very specifically, like a laser swirl, go to the core of the inflammation. In this [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1381.02s)]
*  case the core inflammation is to block it. The core of the inflammation is IL-17A and F, and the therapeutic [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1387.66s)]
*  modulation would be to block the activity of these two cytokines. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1394.22s)]
*  These particular inflammatory diseases that you're talking about, the psoriotic arthritis, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1398.0600000000002s)]
*  and the others, how prevalent are they? What sort of caseload are we talking about? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1403.58s)]
*  Very prevalent. And we describe these diseases, Dylan, today as the so-called type 3 diseases. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1409.34s)]
*  Type 1 would be a disease like lupus. Type 2 would be a disease like atopic dermatitis. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1417.8999999999999s)]
*  And the type comes from an exaggerated expression of a specific cytokine. So now type 3 would be the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1423.58s)]
*  disease where you find too much IL-17A and F. That's the joining element of these diseases. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1429.18s)]
*  Psoriasis, Dylan, 2 to 3 percent in the western countries. Hydrodylated supratibar, probably [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1434.6200000000001s)]
*  similarly prevalent, 1 to 2 percent. Psoriotic arthritis, 0.5 percent. And then there is a growing [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1442.0600000000002s)]
*  list of diseases that also share as a main pathophysiological element this overexpression [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1449.98s)]
*  of IL-17. So I would think that altogether the chronic inflammatory diseases in this type 3 [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1455.18s)]
*  bucket could be easily 10 percent, 50 percent or more. And single individuals of these diseases [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1461.3400000000001s)]
*  alone are already very prevalent conditions. Now obviously you're talking a lot about size [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1467.74s)]
*  when you're talking about nanobodies compared to traditional antibodies or other antibodies. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1473.9s)]
*  What does it actually mean for the patient? Is it just that 1mL injection? Is it a smaller [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1478.94s)]
*  injection? I think convenience does play a role with chronic therapy, Dylan. Let me start by [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1484.86s)]
*  quickly talking about tablets, right? Because that's a question we also often get, right? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1494.62s)]
*  But I have to say my experience is that patients enjoy having a 5 second shot once per month [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1499.6599999999999s)]
*  compared to taking tablets twice or once every day, right? If I have to take antibiotics for [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1507.82s)]
*  three weeks, probably I forget it on seven days, right? You travel, you go outdoor, you forget your [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1514.54s)]
*  tablets. So I think just to start with, I think that the subcutaneous easy delivery of these [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1521.1s)]
*  molecules is a great advantage when it comes to convenience. Now the nanobodies are very small. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1529.26s)]
*  That means that you can deliver the therapeutic amount, the volume that you need to deliver is [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1535.98s)]
*  small. In our case, it's 1mL. These drugs are very small, so the fluid has a low viscosity. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1540.8600000000001s)]
*  It's very easy to inject this molecule. As I said, our injection is only three to five seconds. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1548.06s)]
*  And then we haven't talked about this. These nanobodies, at least psoriloma, they also do not [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1554.46s)]
*  seem to develop a clinically relevant immunogenicity. You have to understand that [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1560.78s)]
*  whenever you inject the protein into a human being, there is a risk that this human being [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1565.26s)]
*  develops antibodies against this drug. The important question is, do they impact the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1571.34s)]
*  effect? Do they reduce the drug levels? Do they reduce efficacy or safety? And with psoriloma, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1577.66s)]
*  we also do not see a clinically relevant immunogenicity. That means you can have your [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1584.14s)]
*  short, easy, painless injection five seconds once per month, and you don't run the risk that you lose [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1590.5400000000002s)]
*  the response. This is at least what we have been seeing in our clinical trials. Very stable response [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1597.8200000000002s)]
*  over time. And on the other 29 days and 23 hours and 59 minutes, you can basically forget about [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1603.74s)]
*  your disease. So I think some of these features are shared with antibodies, but I would think [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1611.8200000000002s)]
*  compared to the antibody treatments that we have in HS, this better convenience that we think is [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1617.66s)]
*  linked also to our molecule, the nanobody is already an advantage we have in our pocket. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1624.0600000000002s)]
*  Tell me a little bit more about what you're seeing in the clinic. You said you're moving [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1630.14s)]
*  into phase three trials. Yeah, absolutely. So let me focus to start with on hydrodenditis superativa. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1633.42s)]
*  We did a large global phase two in 234 patients. This was done in North America and in Europe. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1642.54s)]
*  You often, Dylan, when you start treating patients with very active disease, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1652.22s)]
*  so they have high levels of the mediator that you want to inhibit, you need to give a little [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1656.8600000000001s)]
*  bit more in the beginning. This is called an induction therapy, and then you move on to a [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1661.5s)]
*  maintenance therapy. With our drug, the induction therapy goes to week eight, and already from week [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1665.98s)]
*  eight on, that would be every other week injections, we go to monthly injections. That is exactly [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1671.98s)]
*  the regime we tested in this phase two trial. And by the way, this also compares favorably to some [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1677.34s)]
*  of the antibody induction regimes that go a lot longer to 16 weeks. We have a lot more injections [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1683.18s)]
*  to get the drug going. In this phase two trial in hydrodenditis superativa, we tested different doses [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1688.06s)]
*  of our molecule. We have seen, Dylan, that compared to psoriasis, a more superficial skin [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1693.82s)]
*  condition, antibodies often need to double their dose to see some efficacy in hydrodenditis superativa. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1700.06s)]
*  I think indicating again that antibodies struggle to a certain degree to reach these difficult to [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1707.34s)]
*  reach sites of inflammation. The dose that we saw being optimal in HS was the same dose we saw to [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1713.82s)]
*  deliver an optimal response in psoriasis. We also had, and of course you compare your drug to placebo [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1721.58s)]
*  to really show what it's doing, but in all the phase two trials that Moolad has been doing, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1728.62s)]
*  we always have an active reference out. So we also use a drug that is known. We use a drug that has [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1732.78s)]
*  already done phase three trials. Why do we do this? Not so much to directly compare, but to validate [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1739.58s)]
*  our findings. If you can replicate the data that others have been shown previously with a drug that [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1745.82s)]
*  is around, I think it's telling you you have you got your study design right. You have enrolled the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1752.3799999999999s)]
*  right patients. So to summarize, we did this 24-week trial. The primary endpoint was at week 12. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1756.86s)]
*  We used a higher outcome than others have used before, an outcome called high score 75. The number [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1763.82s)]
*  indicates the percentage improvement compared to baseline, so at least 75% improvement of HS. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1770.54s)]
*  We saw a delta to placebo of for our 120 milligram dose Dylan of 29%. In similar trials, the existing [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1776.78s)]
*  antibodies have shown numbers 12, 16, 18. So I think now you understand why there was a lot of [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1786.3s)]
*  excitement. It really elevated the bar. It did this with a very convenient induction and maintenance [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1793.18s)]
*  regime. Really also decreasing these deep dermal lesions. We saw specifically tunnel stopping to [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1800.14s)]
*  drain. We saw abscesses melting away. And then we saw a very, very convenient safety profile. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1808.7s)]
*  Responses didn't stop at week 12. We could see that they would further continue between week 12 and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1815.9s)]
*  week 24. And based on this data, we said let's do a phase three. We could use the same study design. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  We did our phase two pivotal like Dylan. If you discuss with knowledgeable people, they will [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1828.94s)]
*  always tell you, yeah, but you run a high risk that your data between phase two and phase three [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1836.54s)]
*  is kind of being compressed. Yes, there's always this risk, but of course your risk is a lot smaller [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1840.46s)]
*  if you do your phase two properly, if you do it large, if you do it placebo and active reference [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1846.54s)]
*  control, if you already use a study design that you plan to use in phase three, if you use the same [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1851.42s)]
*  dose, if you really have identified your optimal dose in phase two. So based on the shoulders of [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1857.66s)]
*  this very exciting and successful phase two, Dylan, we designed our phase three. This was started in [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1862.78s)]
*  May 2024. And as I said earlier, we expect to read out the primary endpoint, which is week 16 in this [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1870.0600000000002s)]
*  case later this year. I guess the trial design is really important, but then there's also the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1877.5s)]
*  business side too. Two areas of operations I'd like to hear you talk about. One is manufacturing, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1884.06s)]
*  so being able to produce the nanobodies in the amount that you need for the trials. And the other [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1890.62s)]
*  is any regulatory challenges that you're facing, manufacturing and regulation. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1896.46s)]
*  So regulatory is based on its own, right? If you would ask me, Christian, did you ever dream about [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1902.7s)]
*  regulatory when you are a dermatologist and immunologist? Not so sure, but there are good [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1908.22s)]
*  reasons why this is probably the most formalized, regulated product development that you can do. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1912.78s)]
*  You treat disease patients. You have to do this in Europe and you have to do this in the US. The [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1918.22s)]
*  regulatory authorities not always overlap. So believe me, there are a million of regulatory [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1923.98s)]
*  hurdles you have to jump over. But I think it was recognized that we did our phase two studies [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1928.3799999999999s)]
*  properly. The FDA and the EMR both agreed that we had identified the dose clearly in phase two [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1933.8999999999999s)]
*  with an optimal benefit risk profile that allows us to only do one dose in phase three compared to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1941.66s)]
*  placebo. So it can really simplify our design a lot. And I think we have found good arguments [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1948.5400000000002s)]
*  for most of our cases with regulatories East and West of the Atlantic. So I think we are extremely [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1956.3000000000002s)]
*  confident about our interactions with the regulatory authorities. Of course, you also have to be clever, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1962.6200000000001s)]
*  right? And it doesn't mean that you should do everything like others have been doing it. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1969.18s)]
*  Again, we move the outcome from high score 50 to high score 75. But regulatory authorities [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1974.3s)]
*  recognize this. They see that you don't want to just do a need to product. They see that you really [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1979.18s)]
*  want to challenge your product. Can you get more? So I think this was pretty much appreciated. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1984.0600000000002s)]
*  Manufacturing a completely different animal. Nanobodies are not made in Chinese hamster ovarian [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1990.3s)]
*  cells, the typical host cell to make antibodies. They are actually made in the yeast cell called [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=1995.82s)]
*  pichia pastoris. The process, however, is extremely robust. We think that there's even some advantages [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2001.34s)]
*  when it comes to cox, for example, down the line. But we have inherited this process from Merck. It [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2008.3799999999999s)]
*  had been transferred several times. We inherited an already extremely stable process. We are very [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2015.34s)]
*  happy with the site that is doing our drug substance. We have already produced everything, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2022.78s)]
*  every drug that we need, not only for our ambitious clinical program, but even for the first years [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2028.94s)]
*  after launch. So I think also manufacturing wise, we're in extremely good shape, given the [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2035.1s)]
*  stage of the company we're in. And are you working with other pharmaceutical companies or it's just [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2041.5s)]
*  Merck through that licensing deal? We are working now with no other company, right? We work as [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2048.3s)]
*  Moonlake left, right and center. Merck got some money, obviously. Merck got a certain percentage [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2055.42s)]
*  of Moonlake in the beginning, but this is where it ended. We had a science collaboration where [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2063.1000000000004s)]
*  Merck helped us to understand how our model, how our nanobody would look like in an environment [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2069.5s)]
*  where all the dimers and albumin is around. And they helped us to clearly document that [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2076.38s)]
*  Sunilucumab can bind to R17 dimers and albumin at the same time. But I would think, Dylan, other [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2081.9s)]
*  than that, it's all Moonlake now, 110% Moonlake. There's also no cooperation with other pharmaceutical [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2088.2200000000003s)]
*  companies. We know what we are doing. I think we have proven that we can develop, that we can do [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2095.6600000000003s)]
*  our clinical development in a very fast and very valid way. I would think that when we fully enroll [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2101.74s)]
*  our phase three, we have done it with at least double the industry standard. We take full advantage [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2109.58s)]
*  of being a small, aggressive, lean biotech company. But at the same time, of course, we really open [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2115.8199999999997s)]
*  up to every quality measure that you can think. If you look at the design of our phase two trials, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2124.9399999999996s)]
*  I think you will recognize they're all done in an extremely solid way. We did a lot of basic [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2130.7s)]
*  science. We did a lot of activities to understand the characteristics of our molecule better. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2136.62s)]
*  So I think Moonlake has proven that it can create a scientific, a manufacturing, a clinical operations [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2142.14s)]
*  package that would be a challenge to be pulled off even by Big Pharma in this relatively short [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2148.54s)]
*  period of time. Let's take a look forward now. If we can just look forward generally when it [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2154.3799999999997s)]
*  comes to nanobodies, where do you see them developing just as a subset of these biologicals [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2160.54s)]
*  in the years ahead? I said earlier, Dylan, that very clearly the antibodies have been an absolute [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2167.2599999999998s)]
*  therapeutic revolution in the space of immunology and inflammation. They've also been a revolution [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2175.1s)]
*  in oncology, but let's focus on inflammation here. Most of the antibodies that we currently have, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2181.5s)]
*  they block one cytokine and one cytokine alone, but there is increasing understanding that many [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2187.26s)]
*  of the chronic inflammatory conditions are more complex, that they are driven by more than one [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2194.1400000000003s)]
*  pathway. And I said earlier that one beauty of the whole nanobody platform of nanobodies is that you [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2199.1800000000003s)]
*  easily can create multi-specific molecules. So as I said, I think that in five, 10 years looking back, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2205.5800000000004s)]
*  there is an era of nanobodies dawning. I think we will see more nanobodies coming. We will see [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2215.26s)]
*  more nanobodies coming that block, inhibit more than one cytokine. And again, Sunil Lokumar blocking [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2221.18s)]
*  IL-17A and F is a first shining example. I think there are more to come. I do think there is more [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2227.02s)]
*  and more solid evidence that the story that I was telling, the better tissue penetration, the [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2234.86s)]
*  enhancement of signs of inflammation, the low absent, I should say, clinically relevant immunogenicity, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2240.06s)]
*  probably some advantages in the way they are manufactured. I see multiple reasons why [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2246.94s)]
*  nanobodies can easily become the antibodies 2.0 and not only in immunology and inflammation, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2252.22s)]
*  but definitely also in immunology and inflammation. If that's nanobodies generally then, but where does [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2259.82s)]
*  Moon Lake fit? Can we look a little bit forward? I know you've got some results coming out relatively [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2265.82s)]
*  soon. Where are you going to fit in this world of nanobodies? Yeah, I'm telling you right now, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2271.1800000000003s)]
*  I open my eyes in the morning and hope to get through the next day and the next week and pull [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2278.1400000000003s)]
*  all of this off. But no, very clearly, we currently develop Sunil Lokumar in phase three. We do this in [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2282.6200000000003s)]
*  adults and adolescents with HS. We do this in adults with active serotic arthritis. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2290.62s)]
*  We have started clinical trials in palmoplanta postulosis. We have started clinical trials in [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2297.74s)]
*  axial spondyloarthritis. There is a long list of additional diseases that Moon Lake may consider [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2303.9s)]
*  attacking. Diseases of your blood vessels, diseases of your macular skeletal systems. As I said, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2311.18s)]
*  as we move along, we have an increasing understanding of how many diseases are actually [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2318.14s)]
*  driven by L17. So we can extend our Sunil Lokumar play very clearly. Nothing stops us at some point [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2323.02s)]
*  to think about looking at other molecules. Obviously, we have a big passion for nanobodies, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2331.3399999999997s)]
*  but Dylan, right now, we really clearly focus on Sunil Lokumar. We really clearly focus on [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2337.8199999999997s)]
*  these important indications in DERM and RUUM. And we want to first show that we win in those, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2343.18s)]
*  and then let's do the next step. Christian, this has been fascinating. It certainly sounds exciting. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2348.54s)]
*  If there was just one thing you could leave the listeners with about nanobodies or about Moon Lake, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2354.62s)]
*  what would you like that to be? Yeah, it's this, I would almost say, don't stop dreaming, right? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2360.06s)]
*  And don't think because others have been doing things that you shouldn't consider doing things [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2367.8199999999997s)]
*  differently. Always in the framework of validity and quality. I think Moon Lake is a good example. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2372.94s)]
*  We have done many things where people were telling us, you can't do that, right? And we did. And we [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2378.7s)]
*  did it with success. In the near future, I would say, watch out for the results of our phase three [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2384.54s)]
*  trial. We have announced in a press release yesterday that we will talk on the 29th of April [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2391.1s)]
*  in New York about the baseline characteristics of our HSS program, taking obviously another variable [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2398.54s)]
*  out of the game. We will announce exactly when we will share with the world the data from the primary [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2405.42s)]
*  endpoint, because the studies will continue while we will show the primary endpoint. We will probably, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2410.7s)]
*  as a little extra, the cherry on the whipped cream, we will share some interim results of our [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2416.06s)]
*  palmoplanta postulosa study. So I would say in the near future, watch out and see if all this excitement [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2421.66s)]
*  around nanobodies, if this is all converting into really better outcomes for diseases that currently [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2428.06s)]
*  have a significant unmet need. Christian, thanks for joining us on Beyond Biotech. Thank you so much, Dylan. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M7Ds9AqlY&t=2434.62s)]
