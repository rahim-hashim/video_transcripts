# Can stem cells transform spinal cord injury treatment? Lineage Cell Therapeutics thinks so.
**Beyond Biotech:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Kassane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 141 for the podcast. This week I had the pleasure to talk to Brian Cully, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=11.88s)]
*  CEO of Lineage Cell Therapeutics. Lineage is a long time player in the cell therapy space [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=19.48s)]
*  and Brian is an industry veteran. I'm sure you'll find our conversation about stem cell [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=25.56s)]
*  therapy and its applications to spinal cord injuries interesting. Brian Cully, welcome to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Beyond Biotech. Before we get going, Lineage is a listed company, right? Where can people go to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  learn more about the company? Well, I'd like to remind your listeners that Lineage Cell Therapeutics [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=42.44s)]
*  is a publicly traded company so they can learn about the risks and opportunities of investing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=48.2s)]
*  in the company through our filings which are available at sec.gov. It would be great if we [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=52.72s)]
*  could start by just getting a bit of a rundown on who you are and how you found your way to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=58.2s)]
*  being CEO of Lineage. Well, thanks Dylan. It's really nice to be here today. You know, my [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=63.4s)]
*  background is in basic research. I used to be a drug hunter many years ago in the lab. I worked [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=70.24s)]
*  in academia and industry as a person who was looking for small molecules to treat various [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=77.2s)]
*  diseases. Over the years, I migrated through technology licensing and business development [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=85.2s)]
*  before having an opportunity to become CEO of what was then a cancer company. That journey continued [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=91.08s)]
*  for a number of years. I was working in the malaria space which was really interesting but there's not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=97.84s)]
*  a lot of capital to do things in the malaria space. I was looking for a more conventional job and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=103.04s)]
*  was introduced by a recruiter to Lineage. I thought, wow, this is a really interesting company. There [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=108.48s)]
*  are a lot of things that a CEO could do to leave a mark, hopefully a positive one. In my time here, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  I've just really become passionate about the potential for cell therapies to change how we [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  treat certain diseases. It's been a long and incredibly rewarding journey both here at Lineage [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=127.96s)]
*  and throughout my career. Tell me a little bit about Lineage. Can you just give sort of an overview [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=132.92s)]
*  of what you do there and what Lineage's mission is? Lineage is working to advance sort of a frontier [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=138.16s)]
*  of medicine. Many people are familiar with cell therapy or feel that they're familiar with cell [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=146.6s)]
*  therapy but there's a certain form of it which we practice. That is that we are essentially making [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=152.96s)]
*  replacement parts for people. Your body, my body, they're comprised of about 200 discrete cell types. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=158.72s)]
*  We can manufacture in the lab replacement versions of some of those cells. For example, if you needed [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  cardiomyocytes which are heart cells to treat certain condition, you might say, oh, if I could [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=175.28s)]
*  manufacture replacement heart cells and transplant them to the patient, I might be able to treat a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=180.0s)]
*  disease. We've found a number of applications of that mostly in neural settings. This would be the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=185.16s)]
*  eye, the brain, spinal core, the ear is a relatively new one. It's really that simple. The diseases [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=191.76s)]
*  or conditions where a certain cell type is destroyed or dies off or you simply outlive it, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=200.52s)]
*  and we can make replacement versions of those cells and give those to you in an effort to try to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=207.12s)]
*  recover the normal function that you had before you lost the cells. Can you tell me a little bit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=212.08s)]
*  about Lineage, the company? Because like you said, it was one that you came to as CEO. How long has [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=217.72s)]
*  it been around? How long has it been established? How many people are working there? Today we have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=224.52s)]
*  approximately 75 employees. The company has existed for literally for decades. It was one of the early [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=229.84s)]
*  innovators in this space. It's interesting to me because many times people think, oh, this company [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=236.96s)]
*  has been around for 20 or 25 years and has never gotten a drug approved. They see it as a negative, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=243.04s)]
*  but I feel differently because when you're working in a new space, an innovative area, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=247.88s)]
*  having decades of experience and learnings and lessons can actually be a real superpower for [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=253.64s)]
*  the field. I think that we needed to see a convergence of a maturation of the field along [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=260.28s)]
*  with our own experiences to get where we are today. It's really exciting now because as I look [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=266.4s)]
*  across the street or across the country or across the world, I see companies that sort of resemble [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=271.76s)]
*  us. They're doing very similar things and they're having a lot of success. It's tremendously exciting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=277.28s)]
*  to be working in a space, the cell transplantation space, at a time where it really seems to be [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=282.88s)]
*  accelerating in the hands of a lot of people simultaneously. One of the areas that you're [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=290.52s)]
*  working in is to do with spinal cord injuries. Maybe you can give us a little bit of a background [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  on that. Are they really prevalent? What causes them? How many people are touched by these sort [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=302.32s)]
*  of injuries? It's a tremendously challenging and frankly a very sad situation. The global prevalence [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  for spinal cord injuries is upwards of 20 million people. You're talking about almost a million [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  people a year suffering typically from things like falls and motor vehicle accidents. Here in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=320.16s)]
*  the US, there are about 300,000 people who suffer from spinal cord injuries. Now you're talking [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=326.6s)]
*  about 18,000 people a year. What makes this particularly frustrating is that unlike someone [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=332.16s)]
*  who perhaps develops lung cancer and says, well, I worked in a smoky bar in the 70s and you can [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  connect the condition with the cause, spinal cord injuries are so frustrating because nobody [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=345.32s)]
*  expects or anticipates that they will suffer from one. They're always coming out of left field. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=352.08s)]
*  They're about 80% male. They tend to be younger, although older people also will suffer from falls [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=357.24s)]
*  and vehicular accidents. It's tremendously expensive to the system. You can find people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=363.76s)]
*  running up bills of one to five million. It's tremendously common and there's a real paucity [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=369.4s)]
*  of therapeutic options for individuals who suffer from these spinal cord injuries. It robs people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=376.08s)]
*  of their quality of life. It robs literally the person from their ability to move. It's a real [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=384.88s)]
*  honor to work in this space. Unfortunately, there aren't enough people who do work in this space [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=391.96s)]
*  because it's tremendously important. I guess there's a bigger cost there as well because if [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=397.32s)]
*  you're talking tens of thousands of people in the US and then millions around the world, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=402.2s)]
*  there's also families on top of that, workplaces on top of that. There are a lot of adaptations [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  that have to be done to have people re-enter the society and be able to live close to normal lives. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=412.36s)]
*  Is there a more global cost that we can talk about there? Yeah, there absolutely is because [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=418.2s)]
*  certainly the caregiver numbers and they can vary. You can have someone who may require [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=425.56s)]
*  around-the-clock support to assist them with their daily living. That actually gets to the heart of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=431.8s)]
*  what we're trying to do. If you can improve someone's condition so that they can move from [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=438.68s)]
*  requiring full-time support to just part-time support. If you can get someone who can feed [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=444.24s)]
*  and use the bathroom independently, you really are saving a lot of capital because you're able [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=451.36s)]
*  to get that person to be more self-sufficient. As people regain their activities with their upper [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=458.24s)]
*  extremities, they can find jobs. There are so many jobs now that are virtual. If you can use a phone [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=465.04s)]
*  or a keyboard or speech to text, you can get back engaged into the workforce in a very conventional [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=470.88s)]
*  way. Whereas otherwise, there's an enormous feeling of isolation and separation from society. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=478.88s)]
*  Yes, the cost goes far beyond the medicines and the equipment and goes into all the caregivers [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=484.4s)]
*  and tax revenues. It becomes quite a significant amount. That being the case, what are the current [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  treatment options? What do people have access to right now? The treatment options break across [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=497.76s)]
*  two sides. You have the immediate treatment options. These are surgical interventions, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=504.64s)]
*  surgical repair, and the medication that goes along with caring for someone shortly, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=511.2s)]
*  even hours, days, and weeks after an accident. Then you have the longer-term care, rehabilitation. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=516.48s)]
*  You'll have physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, all the assist devices. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=523.52s)]
*  Then you can start to introduce some of the other interventions like electrostimulation [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=530.96s)]
*  or cell-based therapy. Brain chip interface has become a really hot topic recently. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  All of these potentially could work together, but not everyone has access to all of these. You've [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=544.96s)]
*  got people who might live very far from a center of excellence. They might not have high-quality [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=551.04s)]
*  insurance to be able to access this care. The disparity across a patient and the patient's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=557.84s)]
*  family and their caregiver's experience is actually quite diverse. What's really unfortunate is there [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=564.32s)]
*  is no silver bullet. There is no magic that can help someone do away with their wheelchair. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=570.72s)]
*  Most of us are really trying to drive some sort of incremental change in a person's functional [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=576.72s)]
*  abilities because even small changes can be tremendously valuable to the individual in ways [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=583.12s)]
*  that you and I really don't appreciate. For example, just a quick side story. I went to visit a [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  young man who was involved in our clinical trial. He lived in Chicago. I went to visit him at his [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  home. He's living alone. There are all sorts of items around his home. I said, Chris, what are [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=599.2s)]
*  these for? This, that, the device and metal pieces and everything. He said, oh, each of these [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=606.64s)]
*  connects me in a way from what I'm able to do to what I need to do. For example, if his shoe fell [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=612.64s)]
*  off, he had a particular device that helped him get his shoe back on. That's not a product that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=618.48s)]
*  you can go to Amazon and purchase. It's a very unique custom item for him. It really highlighted [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=624.96s)]
*  for me that very small improvements in mobility can lead to meaningful changes in the quality [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=631.36s)]
*  of life of the individual. We need to entrust that the individuals have the creativity and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=638.48s)]
*  the motivation and need to be able to find those use cases. If that's what's currently available, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=643.52s)]
*  then what's the role or what's the place of stem cell therapies in helping people with these spinal [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=650.16s)]
*  cord injuries? Our view of stem cell therapy, which is maybe different from what many listeners [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=656.08s)]
*  would think of, we do not take stem cells and put them into patients. We don't inject them into the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=663.36s)]
*  bloodstream and hope for magical anti-inflammatory properties. What we do is we just simply use stem [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  cells as starting material because stem cells have two characteristics that are special. One is [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=676.88s)]
*  they are self-renewing, so we can have essentially an endless supply of them that we can generate in [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=684.8s)]
*  the lab. The other is that they are capable of turning into other cell types. We'll take what are [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=690.72s)]
*  essentially blank stem cells and we will give them instructions in the lab. Over the course of many [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=698.4s)]
*  weeks, we can manufacture very large numbers of what are called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  or OPCs. That's a different cell type. It's not a stem cell. It's actually the cell that you will [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=710.64s)]
*  find in the spinal cord of every human being. It's responsible for manufacturing myelin. Myelin is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  the conductive sheath that goes around an axon. You can imagine that the reason that wires [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=728.0s)]
*  are wrapped in insulation is to help with their efficiency of conducting electrical information. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=734.56s)]
*  The human cells are really the same. We are delivering to an individual millions of oligodendrocyte [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=739.76s)]
*  progenitor cells, which are the same cell type that is lost after an accident. We're replacing that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=747.92s)]
*  cell type in order to restore function. The individual will accept those cells. They're put [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=754.16s)]
*  right onto the lesion, right to the site of injury. Hopefully, they will work to help axonal [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=760.4s)]
*  regeneration and reconnection so that the signals that are going from the brain to the extremities [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=766.4s)]
*  can be detected and convert into intentional mobility. Obviously, you're already in the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=772.4s)]
*  clinic then. You've passed through phase one. Can you tell us a little bit about how that phase one [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=779.28s)]
*  trial went? Yes. The first clinical trial of this technology was done in individuals with thoracic [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=784.72s)]
*  injuries. There were five people who had thoracic injuries. The technology was well tolerated. There [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=792.72s)]
*  weren't any unusual safety signals. The next trial was done in 25 individuals who had a [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  cervical injury. This is a common type of injury up in the cervical nerves running from about C3 to C7. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=807.12s)]
*  Those patients, there were 25 of them. It was very exciting. There were cases that were [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=817.12s)]
*  unexpected. People had unexpectedly high recovery compared to what we would have expected with an [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=824.64s)]
*  untreated patient. Again, it was very safe and well tolerated. That was very exciting because [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=831.84s)]
*  you see phase one data and the surgeons and the physical therapists are saying, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=840.72s)]
*  we think there's a benefit here. We definitely saw people as a young man who couldn't even shrug [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=844.88s)]
*  his shoulders and now he has the manual dexterity to actually cap a cat five cable. If you think [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=850.4s)]
*  about all those eight tiny little wires that go into a cat five cable in the back of your computer, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=857.28s)]
*  he has that level of manual dexterity that he can replace those. We were really excited, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=861.84s)]
*  but there were a couple of things that needed to be done before we could move into a larger study [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=867.76s)]
*  because we didn't particularly like how the cells were being delivered. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=873.68s)]
*  In particular, patients needed to be disconnected from the respirator when they were receiving the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=877.68s)]
*  cell. That means they're not breathing, which means the surgery needs to go very quickly. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=883.68s)]
*  We're actually in the clinic now. We just last month opened up a new clinical study where we're [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  evaluating a device. It's a really small device that attaches right to the patient [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=895.52s)]
*  and allows the cells to be delivered to the patient over three to five minutes, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=900.72s)]
*  much more slowly than before because the device is connected to the patient. As the patient's [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  chest cavity is going up and down in connection with their breathing, the device and the needle [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  and the flow path of the cells, that's all moving at the same time. You're no longer racing against [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=917.84s)]
*  the clock to deliver the therapy. We think that'll be much more deployable in a larger study and [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=923.12s)]
*  easier to use. We're going to treat between six and ten patients with this new device. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=929.84s)]
*  It was quite exciting that when we were talking to the FDA about it, we were encouraged to, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  for the first time, include patients who had chronic injuries. Rather than subacute injuries, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=940.0s)]
*  which are occurring in just 21 to 42 days after the initial insult to the spinal cord, that's a [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=947.12s)]
*  subacute window. We're talking about people who maybe their injury was one, three, or even five [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=955.2s)]
*  years ago. The reason why that's exciting is those individuals will have plateaued. They're not [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=960.4000000000001s)]
*  gaining any more function. They're at a stable level. If they are participating in our trial, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=965.76s)]
*  if they do enjoy any benefit and we detect that benefit, that's really exciting because it opens [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  up a whole new line of investigation about maybe it's not people who have recent injuries, but maybe [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=976.1600000000001s)]
*  we can help people who actually have older injuries. That would be tremendously exciting [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=981.68s)]
*  for the field. This new clinical trial, this is the DOST study? Am I saying that right? It's a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=986.2399999999999s)]
*  DOST study? Yes, that's the study of the new delivery device. What's the primary objective [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=992.3199999999999s)]
*  there? What sort of endpoint are you looking for? Really, it's just safety. The old way of delivering [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=999.28s)]
*  the cells had this big scaffold and it was fixed. It was connected to the bed. It had many parts [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1005.6s)]
*  and it was sort of complicated to use. The DOST study is just showing that we can replace all of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1012.88s)]
*  that scaffolding, that whole gantry system with this tiny little unit. It's about the size of a [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1018.32s)]
*  loaf of bread. Anytime you switch delivery tools, you need to demonstrate that those tools are safe [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1024.08s)]
*  and can perform as expected. That's why this next clinical study is so small, just six to ten [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1032.4s)]
*  patients, because we're really using the same material, but we're swapping out the way that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1038.24s)]
*  that material is delivered. The needle part, the part that goes inside the body, that's all the same. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  This is really just simplifying the exterior side of it. Rather than having a big desktop computer, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  wouldn't you like to have all that computational power in an iPhone? Yes. That's really an analogy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  that you could apply for this DOST study. Now, for this DOST study, are you working with a [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1063.36s)]
*  particular hospital or a particular hospital group somewhere in the US? The first site that we've [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  opened is at UC San Diego Health. That's right here in San Diego, so it's local to us, which [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1075.2s)]
*  offers some convenience. We expect to open additional sites for this trial. Principally in [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1081.44s)]
*  California, we have a nice relationship with the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1086.88s)]
*  which has been a supportive granting organization to this program in particular. We've received [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1092.24s)]
*  $14 million through that granting agency. We do have a little bit of a bias for the California [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1098.16s)]
*  sites for that reason, but ultimately we have a plan to have this be a national program and even [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1106.48s)]
*  an international program when we reach larger and later stage studies. Now, you explained that this [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1112.48s)]
*  new delivery method is a little bit slower. There's a lot less rush there. What's the advantage of that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1119.52s)]
*  besides just maybe taking some pressure off in surgery? Yeah, there are other advantages. We're [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1126.72s)]
*  actually introducing a new formulation, not the cells, but actually how the cells are prepared. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1133.28s)]
*  The old way of manufacturing and preparing the cells for surgery required hours of plating and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1140.32s)]
*  handling and counting. Every step there introduces risk of infection, risk of error. In fact, there [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1147.76s)]
*  was a patient who received the wrong number of cells. There was a surgical error once years ago. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1155.52s)]
*  What we've done is we've established a different way of making the cells and preparing the cells [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1161.52s)]
*  that now the cells are going from a frozen state to thawed and ready for injection in just five [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1167.52s)]
*  minutes. It's important that that new formulation allows you to go immediately into the patient [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1173.12s)]
*  is compatible with the new equipment. The new equipment we think is not just about safety and [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1179.12s)]
*  more careful and slow delivery, avoiding efflux of cells out of the injection area, simplifying [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1184.88s)]
*  the surgical field that you're working in, but also being compatible with this new formulation, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1192.96s)]
*  which is immediate use and off the shelf. We've even added a new way of making the cells, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1199.44s)]
*  which are making the cells much more pure. The control, the scale of production is much higher. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1206.3200000000002s)]
*  We've made a lot of improvements. Oftentimes, these are behind the scenes and people take [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1213.92s)]
*  these things for granted, but they're necessary in order to have a product which reaches patients [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  in an aggressive and effective way. What sort of timeline are we talking about then with this new [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1225.28s)]
*  study? When should we be starting to see preliminary results? This will be an open label study, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1232.48s)]
*  again to show the safety and performance. Historically, we have shared data on an [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1239.6s)]
*  ongoing basis. I would anticipate that during the year, there would be some preliminary information. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1245.36s)]
*  What's nice about this study is that the endpoint of safety occurs at just 30 days. The primary [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1251.76s)]
*  object of this trial is a readout at 30 days, but we will continue following the patients for [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  for several years. We'll be looking for changes in function that may occur with these individuals. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1265.04s)]
*  Typically, we think that the normal observational period for FDA is 12 months. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1273.04s)]
*  I think that that would be an interesting timeframe to see if there's any improvement in activity. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1279.9199999999998s)]
*  Our corporate history has been to be very open and share data on an ongoing basis. I would [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1285.84s)]
*  anticipate we would continue to behave in that way with this program as well. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1291.36s)]
*  We're talking at the moment about small groups of patients. You're talking about five, six, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1296.56s)]
*  a small number there. How are you going to actually address that once you start to move [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1302.0s)]
*  to these bigger clinical trials of phase two and phase three when you're going to have to scale [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1306.4799999999998s)]
*  manufacturing? Is that something you're going to do yourself? Are you going to work with partners? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1310.08s)]
*  Yeah, several things that are worth mentioning there. Manufacturing of cell therapies is [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  extraordinarily complex. We've become, I believe, one of the best in the world at our particular [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1321.2s)]
*  form of doing that. I think any partner which we could engage in the future would almost certainly [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1329.04s)]
*  rely on us to be a manufacturing center of excellence. We've seen that with a similar [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1335.76s)]
*  program we're doing, which we partnered with the global pharmaceutical company Roche. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1342.8s)]
*  We continue to manufacture retina cells for the program that we partnered with Roche for vision [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  loss due to macular degeneration. The comparable program with spinal cord, we think that there's [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1353.28s)]
*  a lot of value from addressing some of the limitations around delivery and formulation [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1360.64s)]
*  and cell production. Then ultimately, any partner that we might work with in the future, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1366.64s)]
*  we would want to ensure that they have the capability, the expertise, the know-how, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  and also the capital to move this program through larger trials. Part of our work is ensuring that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1377.1999999999998s)]
*  such program is ready for advanced stages of clinical testing. There sometimes are cases where [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1383.84s)]
*  companies get a little excited, they see some data, and they say, oh, we're ready for late-stage [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1391.36s)]
*  testing. Then a partner comes along and says, oh, no, you aren't. We want to make sure we avoid that [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1395.4399999999998s)]
*  situation. We're doing the work to ensure that we have that readiness. That will include also [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1401.2800000000002s)]
*  designing a later-stage study because there have been some amazing advances in technology [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1408.24s)]
*  since people first began to look at spinal cord injury and treating spinal cord injury with [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1414.72s)]
*  complex biological material like cells. Even things like artificial intelligence are making [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1420.3200000000002s)]
*  their way into understanding and predicting how patients will perform over a certain period based [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1427.04s)]
*  on a certain kind of injury. There are technologies like bioinformatics that give you much more [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1434.3999999999999s)]
*  information about the material that you're delivering. It's really exciting because I think [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  that the technological advancements of the last five or six years are putting companies like [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1445.92s)]
*  Lineage in a position to have a much higher probability of success than we would have with [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1451.68s)]
*  the first generation, the first iterations of cell therapies, which were frankly quite limited and [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1456.72s)]
*  have not yet, in most cases, shown what everyone is hoping and expecting from them. Now, Brian, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1462.32s)]
*  you said you worked with or worked with and are working with Roach in a different therapeutic [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1469.52s)]
*  area. When it comes to these spinal cord injuries, is there a pharma company that you're working with [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1474.0s)]
*  or that you have worked with or that you're hoping to work with? Is there a partner out there for [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1479.44s)]
*  Lineage? Well, it's part of our normal and customary and even routine work in developing [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1483.84s)]
*  assets, especially clinical stage assets, is to maintain an open conversation with partners. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1492.08s)]
*  Oftentimes, what that looks like is you talk to a partner and they say, well, that's really interesting. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1497.6799999999998s)]
*  Keep me informed. Check in from time to time. Let me know how things are going. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1503.6799999999998s)]
*  In these companies, the large ones and the small ones are not static. Their priorities change, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1508.8s)]
*  and so a company that might be uninterested in a program today could get a new CEO and might [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1513.44s)]
*  become very interested in that program a week later. So it's really important to always have [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1520.0s)]
*  that back and forth conversation. We're not anticipating that we would partner before we [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1525.04s)]
*  see some of these problems solved. Some of the things that we are doing are not prohibitively [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1531.44s)]
*  expensive, so it makes sense to us to get this, just like someone who wants to sell their house, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1536.3200000000002s)]
*  they're going to trim the bushes, plant some roses, increase the curb appeal, and get better value. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  We want to make sure that we solve some of the easier problems so that if and when we work with [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1548.24s)]
*  someone in the future, which would be normal and consistent with our business, that we really are [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1553.6s)]
*  getting the best possible partner and they're very excited about the program. It's important also that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1559.6799999999998s)]
*  they have the capabilities. As I said earlier on this call, there are not a large number of companies [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1565.2s)]
*  working in spinal cord injury despite the fact that there's a tremendous unmet need. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1570.72s)]
*  And so it's important for us to make sure that any partner is also committed. We have a duty to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1575.76s)]
*  the individuals who are participating in our clinical trials and a duty to our shareholders [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1581.6000000000001s)]
*  to really do the best thing we can here. And so that's an important consideration with partners [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1586.8s)]
*  as well. We want to make sure a partner is equally committed to the furtherance of this program in [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1591.68s)]
*  spinal cord injury. Beyond spinal cord injuries, what other medical conditions, what other [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1596.64s)]
*  therapeutic areas is Lineage looking at? Are there other areas where you think stem cell therapies [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  can really add some value? I absolutely think there are other areas where a cell-based technology [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1608.4s)]
*  can have a greater impact and better clinical outcomes than traditional small molecules and [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1616.72s)]
*  antibodies. And really I need to look no farther than the deal that we struck with Roche and [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1622.48s)]
*  Genentech for dry AMD, one of the leading causes of vision loss. In that condition, people lose a [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1627.52s)]
*  certain retina cell. So we manufacture those retina cells and transplant them to the eye. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1634.0s)]
*  We have been able to show that we could increase vision in what is otherwise a disease where you [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1638.88s)]
*  only get worse. And so you don't need a large number of patients to see this clinical effect [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1644.96s)]
*  because it doesn't happen naturally. That led to a nearly $700 million alliance with Roche and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1649.84s)]
*  Genentech. So we think that the eye is a great place, whether that's RPE cells or photoreceptors. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1655.6799999999998s)]
*  We also have a newer initiative with auditory neurons for hearing loss. Same idea, you lose [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1662.56s)]
*  auditory neurons. I don't care how loud you yell or amplify sound. There's no connection. But if [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1668.0s)]
*  you can manufacture and transplant auditory neurons, you may be able to establish new [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1673.76s)]
*  connectivity to carry that signal into your brain and make sense of what that sound is. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1678.64s)]
*  And we've looked and we've seen other companies working in areas like Parkinson's disease and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1684.0800000000002s)]
*  transplanting dopaminergic neurons or type 1 diabetes where you're transplanting in the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1688.96s)]
*  islet cells of the pancreas. There are probably not 50 ideas that make sense to pursue, but there [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1694.88s)]
*  definitely are a handful that we're excited about and that we're working on. And then we look again [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  at some comparable companies also having a lot of success. Cells seem to be very well tolerated. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1707.6s)]
*  And so if you can manufacture the cell type, if you can get it into the patient, if it's not rejected, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1713.76s)]
*  you stand a very reasonable chance of detecting some sort of change in their performance. And [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1719.6s)]
*  that's what makes this particular form of cell transplantation so much more exciting. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1724.32s)]
*  I mean, it sounds exciting. You sound excited. How close are we to actually bringing this into [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1730.0s)]
*  the mainstream to have it be a therapy that is really accessible to more people? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1736.08s)]
*  Well, the spinal cord program will certainly take years of development still, but I have seen [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1741.36s)]
*  recently some advancements in comparable technology. So if the questions about using cells, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1748.56s)]
*  differentiated cells, replacing a specific functional cell rather than a stem cell, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1755.04s)]
*  we've already seen some examples that are reaching the clinic or close to it. Bayer, for example, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1762.64s)]
*  just announced that they moved from a phase one program. They skipped over phase two and went [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1771.04s)]
*  right into phase three. And they're the company that are making dopaminergic neurons to treat [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1775.68s)]
*  Parkinson's disease. So there's some real aggressive moves and good signs of success in the field. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1780.8s)]
*  And, you know, we hope to be a part of it. But unfortunately, because it is very important and, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1786.72s)]
*  in fact, necessary to demonstrate with statistical evidence that your product works, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  which helps protect people from products which don't work, the time required and the investment [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1801.04s)]
*  required to demonstrate that a treatment is giving a benefit to a patient and is safe relative to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1806.96s)]
*  that improvement is many years and many millions, sometimes tens or even over $100 million of [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1813.28s)]
*  development costs. So it's a long, tough road, but it's so much better than people flying into [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1820.08s)]
*  other countries and saying, you know, give me a shot of stem cells in the arm and, you know, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1827.2s)]
*  here's $20,000 cash and I have no idea if it's going to work or not. You know, that's not the [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1831.52s)]
*  business we're in. And it's unfortunate that those unregulated activities exist. But, you know, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1835.84s)]
*  the cost of proof is very high. But at least then the customer can have the confidence that [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1841.84s)]
*  they have something that's appropriate for their particular disease state or condition. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1847.04s)]
*  Yeah, so that cost of proof, that regulation, that's sort of a necessary [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1852.72s)]
*  break, if you like, on the speed at which this can move to the mainstream. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  Are there other practical or logistical handbrakes there when it comes to manufacturing at scale? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1860.72s)]
*  Yes, manufacturing at scale is a real challenge, especially the way that we are doing it. So we do [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1866.8s)]
*  what's called off the shelf. So we are developing one cell type, it comes from one cell line, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1873.76s)]
*  and we have to make many, many, many doses from that one cell line. That's the only way to make [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1880.56s)]
*  this kind of technology affordable. There are some other technologies where you take cells [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  from a patient, you manipulate them and put them back. Well, those cells are only made for one [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1891.92s)]
*  person. That's the difference between buying a suit off the rack and a suit that's custom tailored [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1898.48s)]
*  on Savile Row in London. So we really embrace the off the shelf approach. It's challenging, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1903.68s)]
*  but it's not impossible. It takes some time, but we've had some great success with it to date. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1910.72s)]
*  And what's nice about that is you're able to avoid this custom therapy issue, which when you look at [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1916.0s)]
*  some of the custom therapies in cancer treatment, $300,000, $500,000 or more, that's unsustainable. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1923.6s)]
*  It really is incredibly expensive. It's life saving in some cases, so I think it can be justified, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1931.4399999999998s)]
*  but it really prohibits broad adoption by regular people. So if you can have a therapy that can be [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1938.0s)]
*  scaled and it can be off the shelf and essentially the same treatment for everyone and it is expected [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1945.44s)]
*  to work for everyone, now if you can scale that product, you can really bring down the cost of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1950.72s)]
*  goods and make it affordable for people and even affordable for the payers. So that's a really [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1955.52s)]
*  important aspect of our technology. Brian, just one last question. If I came back to you in 18 [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1960.72s)]
*  months, where is lineage going to be in 18 months time? We will be an undisputed leader [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1966.56s)]
*  in the new frontier of cell transplantation with compelling evidence in the clinic across multiple [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1975.2s)]
*  programs, high quality partners, high quality investors and an exciting future even beyond [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1981.76s)]
*  those 18 months. Brian, thanks for joining us on Beyond Biotech. My pleasure, Dylan. Thank you. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfFFp9l5jo&t=1990.24s)]
