Video Description: When biotechs start fundraising they regularly turn to the venture capital market seeking investment. The pool of VC money can be large, and part of that pool is corporate venture capital. Backed by firms keen to identify the next big thing in biotechnology, corporate VC money can be an attractive way for biotechs to raise funds privately while benefiting from the support and expertise of corporate supporters.

This week I talked with Paolo Di Giorgio and Regina Hodits of Angelini Ventures, the corporate VC arm of Angelini Industries, itself the parent company of Angelini Pharma. Paolo and Regina lay out their perspective on the current fundraising landscape, identify the trends and opportunities for innovative biotechs in Europe, and walk me though the biggest threats to the biotech investment market they see on the near horizon.

# Corporate venture capital and biotechnology in 2025: challenges, opportunities, and threats
**Beyond Biotech:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Cassane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 150 for the podcast. When Biotech start fundraising, they regularly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=11.52s)]
*  turn to the venture capital market seeking investment. The pool of VC money can be large [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=18.36s)]
*  and part of that pool is corporate venture capital. Backed by firms keen to identify [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=24.28s)]
*  the next big thing in biotechnology, corporate VC money can be an attractive way for biotechs [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=29.48s)]
*  to raise funds privately while benefiting from the support and expertise of corporate [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=35.08s)]
*  supporters. This week I talked with Paolo Di Giorgio and Regina Hoditz of Angelini Ventures, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=40.24s)]
*  the corporate VC arm of Angelini Industries, itself the parent company of Angelini Pharma. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=48.2s)]
*  Paolo and Regina lay out their perspective on the current fundraising landscape, identify [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=54.56s)]
*  the trends and opportunities for innovative biotechs in Europe and walk me through the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=59.3s)]
*  biggest threats to the biotech investment market they see on the near horizon. I hope [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=63.66s)]
*  you enjoy this discussion with Paolo and Regina of Angelini Ventures. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=68.94s)]
*  Paolo and Regina, welcome to Beyond Biotech and Paolo, I want to start with you. Could you just [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=73.06s)]
*  briefly introduce yourself and let us know how did you come to be working here at Angelini Ventures [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=80.74s)]
*  and what drew you to venture capital investing in biotech in the first place? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=86.22s)]
*  Hi Dylan, well good to be here, thank you for the invitation. So I'm the CEO of Angelini [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=91.58s)]
*  Ventures and my background, I started as a scientist, my PhD in the United States and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=98.86s)]
*  then moved to the pharma industry, worked for Big Pharma and then also for Angelini Pharma. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=109.66s)]
*  And I mean I've always been driven by innovation all my career and I try to work approaching [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=119.58s)]
*  innovation from different angles, first as a scientist and then in the pharma business. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=129.18s)]
*  And once you are in that field you realize that most of innovation today is coming from [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=136.14s)]
*  startup, biotech, small sites companies that later on are acquired from pharma and they contribute [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=144.38s)]
*  to what are the drugs approved by FDA. So for me it was a natural transition to venture capital [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=150.61999999999998s)]
*  in that sense of motivation of interest. In addition to the aspect purely related to innovation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=158.7s)]
*  science, I was always attracted by the aspect related to managing a company and more than 360 [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=164.86s)]
*  degrees related to what you need to create a successful project, a successful outcome. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  And this of course is not only something related to science but as we know the team is extremely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  important, the capacity to find the capital, the financial aspect, be sure that all the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=191.58s)]
*  shareholders are aligned and will get the right returns. So that type of complexity really [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=197.82s)]
*  attracted me during my career in addition to the pure passion, let's say for science innovation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=202.86s)]
*  I would say venture capital is the perfect place to combine my interest and I mean frankly I'm [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=209.5s)]
*  happy I think I'm doing the best job in the world and I'm in the best field in the world. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=216.94s)]
*  Of course there are challenges but you know be able to be exposed every day to innovation globally, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=221.74s)]
*  discuss with the top minds, I mean something priceless and I mean it's very something that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=228.22s)]
*  drives me every day. Regina what about you? Did you also have this path through top pharma to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=236.78s)]
*  find your way into the VC world? Hi Dylan, great to be here. Actually no I came more from the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=243.58s)]
*  research and the consulting side but actually I think the final result is exactly as Paolo was [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=251.74s)]
*  saying. I mean the real pleasure that we have here at Angelini Ventures is that we can really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=257.58s)]
*  invest and promote innovation that matters, that is really affecting the lives of people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=262.7s)]
*  and making our healthcare better and making out the lives of people and hopefully people around [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=267.82s)]
*  us that we care about but also on a more global scale better and I think this is really what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=273.18s)]
*  drives most of us in the industry. Of course it's about making money, we have been really fortunate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=278.46s)]
*  that we have been awarded a significant portion of money that we can put to work here with really a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=283.5s)]
*  broad mandate to actually invest in those opportunities as I said that can really drive [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=289.26s)]
*  the healthcare of the future and I came from a research background trained in Vienna and Cambridge [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=293.9s)]
*  UK at the beginning of the biotech world in the basic early to mid 90s when protein engineering [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=299.42s)]
*  was coming of age and the first antibodies that actually now are driving most of the sales within [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=306.62s)]
*  pharma were just kind of coming out of the lab and having seen this transformation of having been in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=312.3s)]
*  the lab that made the technology that made products like Homira possible to really seeing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=317.74s)]
*  this becoming one of the world's largest products is just showing kind of really the opportunities [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=322.54s)]
*  that we can create in this industry. Paolo, Regina mentioned a mandate there maybe we can [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=328.86s)]
*  take it even broader what's the mission of Angelini Ventures what have they tasked you to do? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  Yes so Angelini Ventures was founded in 2022 so we're quite a young group, young VC [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=342.7s)]
*  and so the reason why we create a corporate VC in the Angelini industry group is to have an access [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  I would say smart access to innovation in the in the life science world so we have dual goals one [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=363.58s)]
*  that is strategic and one is financial so the financial goal is quite similar to every independent [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=372.7s)]
*  VC so we're investing only in companies where we think we can generate financial return [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=379.98s)]
*  and with this capital we want to be sure that we can have a sustainable venture capital group [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=385.82s)]
*  and the future the aspiration the ambition to recycle this capital to have a sustainable evergreen [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=391.98s)]
*  venture capital fund. From a strategic point of view we spend a lot of time at the beginning [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=399.98s)]
*  in the genesis of Angelini Ventures to be sure that we will not have made the same mistake that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=406.3s)]
*  other corporate VC have done and I will say if you look the average corporate VC normally last one and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=412.22s)]
*  a half year the reason most of the time the reason why they last so they have such a short lifespan [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  is because they are created with a very strong strategic and captive [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=429.34s)]
*  mandate and sometimes you know the VC they are under the R&D or under the strategy [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=437.5s)]
*  and what they do they fail in understanding what is the real market of the VC how what are the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=445.34s)]
*  dynamics of other investors what other investors look for in when they partner with the corporate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=452.54s)]
*  VC so we spend a lot of time in understanding that and be sure that when we launch our [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=459.82s)]
*  fund this will be done in the right way so from the point of view of structure team [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=465.74s)]
*  also incentives were very similar to an independent VC from a strategic point of view we interact of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  course with our corporate with Angelini industries but our goals are one is to through our investment [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=480.46s)]
*  to give the opportunity to Angelini industry to have access to innovation to really see [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=488.94s)]
*  where the innovation is coming from to interact lightly with our portfolio company without any [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=493.41999999999996s)]
*  specific rights and then I mean if there is a match in the future they can you know as other [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  pharma make an offer for and licensing or for an acquisition but there are no captivity and there [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=505.42s)]
*  is not a special right that we normally ask in our portfolio complex so we operate very similar to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=511.02000000000004s)]
*  independent VC but the advantage is that by operating in this market we can create a network [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=516.22s)]
*  knowledge and an understanding also where the biotech market is going or where the healthcare [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=524.62s)]
*  market is going that in the long term is going to be very useful for a corporate group that has [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=531.02s)]
*  an operating pharma like Angelini industry. In that sense the dual strategy is in one sense to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=538.14s)]
*  identify products that could be interest for pharma in the medium long term but also [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=546.62s)]
*  we're investing digital health and medtech it is an area where Angelini now is not active [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=552.62s)]
*  and in this case we are investing in a company that can really change and be destructive in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  the healthcare business and then in the future you know have also be a potential opportunity to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=565.7399999999999s)]
*  expand the business for Angelini industry in new sectors. So just to wrap up very strong financial [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=572.06s)]
*  mandate and return very strong strategic identity but creating a way that is is light is not something [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=580.86s)]
*  captive for as a corporate VC. Regina if that's the big picture can you tell me a little bit about [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=591.9s)]
*  the focus then Paolo mentioned some medtech some digital health of course the biotech in there as [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=600.62s)]
*  well what are you actually focusing on and how early are these investments being made? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=605.98s)]
*  Absolutely and actually following up from Paolo before we go into some depth [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=612.86s)]
*  I've only recently joined Angelini Ventures from an independent venture fund that I've built in the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=617.02s)]
*  German speaking area for the better part of the 15 years and what has been the attraction apart [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=621.9s)]
*  from the team is really to have this unencumbered mandate. We see so many funds especially here in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  Europe but also globally that getting very focused mandates on a geography on certain stages where [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=633.42s)]
*  actually really these mandates are limiting you to what you can do and also limiting you on how [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=639.9799999999999s)]
*  you can support the companies and here having an evergreen structure they are not bound to a certain [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=645.66s)]
*  length of holding time which is getting in the way or certain geographies where you need to focus [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=650.62s)]
*  a large majority of your cash or certain stages is giving us a lot of freedom but you're absolutely [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=656.54s)]
*  right we see fund without a strategy is basically going all over the place and it's difficult [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=661.58s)]
*  so basically I think the overarching principle as Paolo has also mentioned is that it's really [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=666.7s)]
*  something that needs to be impactful for the healthcare system and that's really kind of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=672.5400000000001s)]
*  considering a patient journey really from diagnosis to treatment to also follow up and supporting [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=676.5400000000001s)]
*  those patients and some of those aspects can be better done with a device some can be better done [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  with a digital solution but if you're home in a little bit when you say stage wise on both of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=686.7s)]
*  those businesses staying with the with the health tech side of the business we see this also a bit [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=692.38s)]
*  of a risk management side that we have a very experienced colleague with Tanya Dao and also [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=698.7800000000001s)]
*  Elia Stubka who's helping on that side that have been in this industry and especially Tanya has [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=703.5s)]
*  also been investing successfully on the digital health side and there's few people that have [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=708.62s)]
*  done that and one of the reasons is that she has been focusing on established business models [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=712.7s)]
*  so if you look at our portfolio a number of our investments on the digital health side or health [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=717.98s)]
*  tech side in general I should say are either already generating revenues or at least we can [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=723.26s)]
*  see a clear business model that has been already established that has already been proven so a [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=729.34s)]
*  little bit later stage although we complement that also on the medtech side in our we call them [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=734.38s)]
*  actually smart devices in a way and connected devices we can actually go earlier but only if [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=740.38s)]
*  this business model question is solved compared to the biotech side where when Angelini Ventures was [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=746.62s)]
*  started given that the strong heritage that the team had on the cns side they did some bold moves [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=752.54s)]
*  in very early investments that are completed could be completely transformational on the cns side [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=758.46s)]
*  and we still have several of those in our portfolio they will take some time but they're [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=765.02s)]
*  giving us as Paolo said is eye on the innovation in that space over the last one and a half years [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=769.98s)]
*  two years that Angelini Venture has been operating separately we've come up with a strategy that says [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=776.46s)]
*  we would like to really focus on a few areas where we can really build expertise and there we also [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=782.46s)]
*  want to be in a position that we can go a bit later in our investment hypothesis because if you [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=788.22s)]
*  know the markets and if you know where those opportunities lie where you can get the highest [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=794.14s)]
*  value creation which is usually translating from pre-clinical to early clinical and clinical proof [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=797.98s)]
*  of concept this is very honestly where most VCs have made their money so we will be focusing on [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=803.26s)]
*  that area we can from time to time go earlier and I think Paolo will come to also our seed activities [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=808.7s)]
*  I guess a little bit later in this call but mainly we're focusing on pre-clinical to early clinical [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=814.86s)]
*  side the areas we like are currently we are focusing on our oncology with a focus actually [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=820.78s)]
*  on targeted therapies anything that's actually getting a payload that's getting an [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=828.06s)]
*  engager of sorts to the side of action is something that we're quite excited about [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=834.06s)]
*  be looking also quite actively in the cardiac metabolic renal space have announced an investment [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=839.26s)]
*  in a company called NuevaCore this week it's also our first venture out to Asia we think the market [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=844.6999999999999s)]
*  actually needs to be looked at globally even given the news from yesterday on the US market [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=850.14s)]
*  very exciting play in the in a gene therapy play in cardiomyopathies but actually not focusing on [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=855.42s)]
*  single mutations but larger target groups again with this idea of creating impact and we're also [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=862.22s)]
*  starting to look at a couple of investments in the ionized space and this is this is fantastic [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=867.5s)]
*  information to know where where Angelini sits and what the strategy is but of course it exists in a [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=874.46s)]
*  bigger venture capital context where do we see that context sitting right now Paulo if I can ask [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=879.98s)]
*  you a couple of years ago 2022 2023 a big funding downturn are we still seeing the challenges that [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=886.54s)]
*  emerged a few years ago existing or are we pulling out of that now and it's clear sailing ahead [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=893.98s)]
*  yeah no I mean I think we still live and we still are experienced a period in the market that is not [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=900.22s)]
*  back to 21 or to the peaks that we saw in the past I mean there are still a time where it's difficult [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  to do fundraising for fund it's also difficult for a company to to fund capital and to close some [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=920.22s)]
*  rounds so what we see now is that some comp we saw much much more internal rounds [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=927.66s)]
*  in some case we saw bigger round than before because investors they want to be sure that the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=936.78s)]
*  company will have the right capital to reach critical milestone and and also takes more time [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=941.5s)]
*  for for startups to close around so these are in core aspect that where it spins in the market [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=948.7s)]
*  in core aspect that where it spins in the market of course from another point of view this is also [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=955.42s)]
*  an opportunity because for a group that now they have the capital to invest I would say compared to [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=960.54s)]
*  few years ago we we can experience you know more reasonable valuation [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=968.78s)]
*  better opportunity to to create value in the futures and of course some rounds they're still [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=976.38s)]
*  quite competitive but I think there is a good opportunity now to have access to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=983.34s)]
*  to good quality companies and there is also some resetting and these these aspects are I will say [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=990.7s)]
*  definitely they are present in biotech but in digital they are even more extreme that case [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=998.62s)]
*  really we are we saw a big resetting in terms of valuation and also some investors that left the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1003.98s)]
*  market there because there is some more time required to to an exit so we we consider that [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1011.98s)]
*  still to be a very interesting sector and I think not necessarily is a bad thing because probably [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1019.4200000000001s)]
*  the result of this in few years will be that there will be fewer companies but much better quality [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1026.7s)]
*  and also with with a better sense on how to spend capital and to focus on on on specific [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1034.3s)]
*  programs so more efficiency in that sense also huge difference between us and europe as it was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1044.94s)]
*  before but I would say also the US market is realizing this and they are they're trying to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1051.34s)]
*  more conscious about capital spending at the level of startup and also in in the fundraising. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1057.74s)]
*  Regina if I can if I can come to you if I'm a biotech and I'm looking for funding [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1068.6999999999998s)]
*  on one side I've got traditional VC on the other side I've got corporate VC [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1073.8999999999999s)]
*  what's the argument for going with corporate VC like Angelina Ventures instead of a traditional VC [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1078.3799999999999s)]
*  firm? So I think if you're a biotech CEO and you're looking for money actually it's a good [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1084.86s)]
*  time to talk to all of the sources of capital that are available given where you are right now just [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1091.74s)]
*  to kind of also get that out of the way times are not easy although I want just to say on the bigger [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1096.06s)]
*  picture if I may for a second honestly in Europe we are not in such a bad situation as basically [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1101.6599999999999s)]
*  it may seem on the outlook because there has been a lot of money raised for Europe in the good years [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1108.1399999999999s)]
*  and we had never a stretch of biotech successes and markets actually going only in one direction [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1112.94s)]
*  which was up as we had from 2014 to 2021. This has been really deep in my 25 years history the time [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1119.26s)]
*  that basically people have been able to raise money to really replenish the coffins and we've [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1127.42s)]
*  also seen the advances of mega funds in Europe be that EQD be that the the Forbes enterprise that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1132.38s)]
*  they have built or Jato and some of the others Novo investing quite a bit also now in Europe [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1138.7s)]
*  so there is actually larger pots of money but actually what's missing is a little bit the clue [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1143.42s)]
*  which we see that be it Angelina Ventures can be which is the clue between some of the localized [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1147.74s)]
*  funds that actually also have local investment mandates and actually then being the series AB [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1153.18s)]
*  investor that can really help them then to get to this level where the mega funds can be excited in [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1158.6200000000001s)]
*  them and also we can kind of bridge the gap until hopefully also the global markets are going to be [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1163.26s)]
*  back again. Corporate funds in general and I think Paolo has already said we are managing money for [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1168.3s)]
*  Angelini industries and not directly for Angelini Pharma. This really the intent to have a much [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1174.46s)]
*  broader look on the innovation landscape beyond the traditional remit of Angelini Pharma which [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1179.6599999999999s)]
*  Paolo has covered before. So by investing this actually by having Angelini Venture invest in [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1185.6599999999999s)]
*  your company what you get is actually the best of both worlds. You get a fund that is really [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1191.74s)]
*  interested in your company proceeding and not as such being a feeder for a pharma pipeline [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1197.1s)]
*  for its own pharma pipeline per se but hopefully for a broader set of pharma pipelines but you have [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1203.02s)]
*  the heritage of people that actually know how to develop drugs that know how pharma works and that [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1208.6999999999998s)]
*  know the diligence that is needed to develop those products and I've we've been all working [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1213.1799999999998s)]
*  together with a number of corporate funds that are more closely linked to corporate R&D. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1218.3s)]
*  In my view they are always an advantage to have them on the cap table as long as you know that [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1223.1799999999998s)]
*  when it comes to an exit or when they have a strategic interest that they will be strategic. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1229.1s)]
*  So as long as you manage that well the input that you're getting is really valuable and money these [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1233.8999999999999s)]
*  days basically is basically trumping everything else. This expertise the networks the connection [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1238.4599999999998s)]
*  to Angelini Industries but also to Angelini Pharma I mean this is fantastic for a biotech [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1246.46s)]
*  who's looking to make those sort of connections especially early on. Can you think of a deal you [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1253.26s)]
*  did recently I mean you just closed one in the last couple of days of course. Can you think of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1257.9s)]
*  a deal that you did recently where this expertise this connection this network this skill was [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1263.26s)]
*  something that really helped you to close the deal? Well maybe just to cite one one deal that [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1269.34s)]
*  we closed recently is a new Miovna is a company based in Copenhagen. It's a company that is [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1277.8999999999999s)]
*  developing a new therapeutic for epilepsy and Angelini Pharma is a pharma operating in the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1285.98s)]
*  epilepsy space. They have a product on the market and so for that particular company we asked [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1293.5s)]
*  the R&D of Pharma to take a look at the science and the potential on drug discovery for this [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1301.82s)]
*  this product and the R&D of Pharma is quite experienced in the field of epilepsy particularly [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1312.94s)]
*  the CSO and his team. So this was done we always careful of course to we have a Chinese wall [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1319.74s)]
*  between us and Pharma so they did their own CBA and their own separate assessment but the CSO was [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1325.5s)]
*  extremely excited about the science beyond the program and the potential and they analyzed the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1334.3s)]
*  company quite truthfully. I mean they come out with their very positive assessment. So this for [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1342.46s)]
*  us was a way to leverage some of the expertise of the Pharma R&D and also I mean of course they [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1351.3400000000001s)]
*  implement they were able to give some advice and some suggestion to the company [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1361.98s)]
*  and so we see in that case it was a dual value one for us to have an additional [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1368.3799999999999s)]
*  validation of the value and the science behind the company on the other hand also [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1375.1s)]
*  to help the company to consider some aspect related to the drug discovery that could have been useful [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1383.1s)]
*  in the future. So I think this could be a good case and other more generic cases that we have a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1389.58s)]
*  very strong IP expert in engineering industry that sometimes help us with the valuation and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1396.22s)]
*  more than once the company they asking to help him create the IP pipeline or IP strategy [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1405.34s)]
*  for their portfolio. So this is another example where somebody from engineering industry [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1412.8600000000001s)]
*  really can help creating value in the portfolio company in addition to the money but also bringing [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1420.5400000000002s)]
*  some expertise that you know for startups are always useful because they have a limited resource [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1426.6200000000001s)]
*  a limited number of people so additional knowledge in some specific space they are always precious. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1432.94s)]
*  And maybe Dylan if I may add to that [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1439.8200000000002s)]
*  the value that I see from having recently joined the team it's one it's the connection that [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1445.26s)]
*  that there can be with Pharma and Paolo described Nürburgring as an example but also Nürburgring [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1451.5800000000002s)]
*  is a good example to see what the team at Angelini Ventures can do it's very rare in my view from [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1457.1000000000001s)]
*  what I've seen and I've been in this industry for quite a time from on both sides of the world [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1463.1000000000001s)]
*  and I've seen it many times from on both sides of the Atlantic that you have in a [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1467.98s)]
*  we see that's not directly bound to a Pharma so not a strategic we see as such so that you find [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1473.26s)]
*  that development expertise so we actually have a CMO on the team we have several people that [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1480.3s)]
*  actually have been involved in running clinical trials we have a close network of advisors not [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1485.02s)]
*  that kind of arms lengths but that are part of our due diligence process that have spent their life [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1490.7s)]
*  pharmacology toxicology preclinical development that really help us to kind of make an assessment [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1496.3s)]
*  on something I mean if you think about numerna it's an easy one where a lot of investors would [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1502.3799999999999s)]
*  say whoa this is an intracicl injection of an azo of a nucleotide based drug in a certain [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1506.7s)]
*  subpopulation of epilepsy so that actually basically means there are so many red flags [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1514.1399999999999s)]
*  in there already for a standard we see to say like wow I'm not really sure how to get my head [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1519.6599999999999s)]
*  around it it's the Angelini venture team that actually has the expertise to diligence that and [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1524.46s)]
*  pick out a way why this actually works for a certain patient population and that's really [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1529.82s)]
*  something well each time I be due to gencing a deal here we're currently looking at several [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1534.6200000000001s)]
*  oncology opportunities I'm super impressed by the speed and the depths of the questions we get and [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1539.3400000000001s)]
*  also the feedback from the entrepreneurs that we get they really love the interaction with the team [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1545.3400000000001s)]
*  because there's a counterpart on the other side that doesn't only understand the financial [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1550.22s)]
*  implications and PD implications which all of the other VCs bring and which is very valuable [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1554.6200000000001s)]
*  and so this goes well beyond a connection to pharma this is really ingrained also within [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1559.66s)]
*  Angelini ventures. Let me ask a little bit about some of the companies that you see that maybe [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1564.54s)]
*  you don't move forward with we don't want to talk about them specifically by name but being a VC [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1570.38s)]
*  means you see a lot of innovation you see a lot of things very very early do you really get a [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1575.58s)]
*  picture out there of what are the therapeutic areas or the modalities that are sparking a lot [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1581.98s)]
*  of interest or where there's going to be some real big steps forward what should we look for [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1587.8999999999999s)]
*  what are the therapeutic areas what are the modalities that you're seeing more and more of [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1592.1399999999999s)]
*  that looks really interesting now? So basically the way how we're trying to stay on the forefront [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1596.1399999999999s)]
*  what's happening is two things one thing what we're doing for example I mentioned that oncology is [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1604.46s)]
*  one of the areas where we have a couple of very active due diligence is ongoing and we very [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1609.58s)]
*  basically picked out a targeted approach where we say whatever we can deliver to the site of action [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1614.38s)]
*  to either kill or the tumor activate the immune system are things that are of interest to us and [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1619.9s)]
*  how do we actually pick why did we pick that and actually how do we pick within that actually [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1625.74s)]
*  really biological themes that matter is first of all is that we actually have colleagues that I [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1631.02s)]
*  told you understand the development paths and these colleagues we really also send out to content [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1637.02s)]
*  driven conferences so not the BD conferences but really talk about the recent conferences like [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1642.22s)]
*  AACR or ASCO or ESMO coming in in autumn and really go there not only with a mandate to kind [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1647.98s)]
*  of just look for some posters but actually to talk to the people that are the leading the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1655.18s)]
*  leading edge innovation sessions there make sure we have the connections to them and then match that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1661.26s)]
*  with what we actually hear from the from the clinicians when we actually do due diligence so [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1666.94s)]
*  we have several active due diligence is ongoing where we have the chance to talk to people that [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1671.82s)]
*  are really seeing patients and actually can come back with the medical need from there and then [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1676.38s)]
*  square that with the kind of connections that we have to the pharma industry to kind of try to feel [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1681.26s)]
*  a little bit what could be on the cards for them in the future and what could still be too far out [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1686.3s)]
*  and with that we're trying to then kind of narrow down the remit and this is how we ended up in [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1691.9s)]
*  certain fields within the oncology space meaning most likely any kind of cell therapy approaches [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1696.86s)]
*  out for us any non-targeted kind of DNA damage repair RNA editing is something you probably have [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1702.94s)]
*  a hard time to get us out of bed right now so and not because we don't see interesting [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1710.5400000000002s)]
*  kind of opportunities there it's just that you need to kind of have a bit of content know-how [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1716.0600000000002s)]
*  you need to have a network due diligence those opportunities and this may change i mean for the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1720.0600000000002s)]
*  right opportunity we may actually say we change that so for example we didn't look for a gene [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1724.46s)]
*  therapy approach to treat cardiomyopathies necessarily but we actually wanted to do [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1730.0600000000002s)]
*  something that actually does really matter in heart failure and we found an opportunity where [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1734.94s)]
*  actually then we adopted our strategy because the opportunity we saw actually really worked for us [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1739.26s)]
*  and this is what we did with Novacor so maybe that's i leave it at that i have some more [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1745.34s)]
*  thoughts on on differentiation on deals but paulo i don't know if there's something you want to add [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1749.66s)]
*  absolutely i think that's uh let's go with quite well paulo if maybe i can come to you what about [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1755.58s)]
*  in terms of geography for investing of course we've always had north america europe [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1761.18s)]
*  we talk about apac in general but is there somewhere that's untapped right now that you [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1765.34s)]
*  might be looking at yes i mean historically we are being uh investing in both the us and european [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1770.22s)]
*  market actually if you see that work portfolio the majority of our investments so far have been [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1778.62s)]
*  done in uh in north america between us and canada and uh just today we announced our first [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1784.9399999999998s)]
*  investment in asia in singapore so uh i mean in the market they are quite uh different [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1791.98s)]
*  in the sense that uh i the us market of course is uh more mature there are more capitals uh there [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1800.22s)]
*  are also more talents that uh have the right expertise to to bring company to the to the final [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1807.74s)]
*  to the final stage uh i mean europe is not far behind with that particularly some geography [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1814.6200000000001s)]
*  maybe south europe like uh italy for example is a country where there is definitely needs [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1821.26s)]
*  for more talents there is good science good vcs uh but is more having the right people with drug [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1827.5800000000002s)]
*  discovery experience that can uh that can uh or like with the with experience of bringing a startup [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1835.42s)]
*  to the right stage that can help transform science in you know in drug discovery [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1842.94s)]
*  and successful company so i mean if you look from from that point of view i think there are [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1850.78s)]
*  some geographies in europe where there is opportunities because there are there are good [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1856.46s)]
*  science a good possibility to to create companies and platforms that would be quite successful in [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1862.62s)]
*  the long term and also the valuation from financial point of view they are much more [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1868.54s)]
*  investor friendly than the united states so that's an area where there is a there is a good [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1873.5s)]
*  opportunity to build company and to to help shape in the team and the direction for a company in the [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1882.22s)]
*  right in the right way asia is another market that we think is very interesting i mean for example [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1890.1399999999999s)]
*  singapore uh there have been in the last decades a lot of effort to to really translate science in [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1896.22s)]
*  in in a company that could be could be of success international not only within the specific [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1904.7s)]
*  geography in addition to that i mean we see a lot of new biotech emerging in the in the chinese [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1915.82s)]
*  market so that's that's an area that we're just starting to look at we did our first investment [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1922.94s)]
*  but we are definitely planning to expand so i mean just to to make it short i think every [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1930.46s)]
*  geography has his own uh pros and cons and uh you know advantage and uh and challenges [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1936.3s)]
*  uh and i think being a global vc like like we are is is a huge is a is a huge advantage [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1945.1000000000001s)]
*  because uh sometimes really see the complementarity between geographies and uh even the possibility [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1954.7s)]
*  i mean now we're all used to work remotely as a team we work remotely as some of our vc our [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1961.9s)]
*  portfolio companies they have team that is a hybrid between europe and u.s. i think if you are able to [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1967.5800000000002s)]
*  build that in the right way you can really get the best of both and you can really find a way to you [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1974.46s)]
*  know to initiate maybe just to give you an example a company europe with great science [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1980.3799999999999s)]
*  with good founders and then try to get management in from u.s. and then be able to raise a additional [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1984.94s)]
*  round uh with a better valuation on the u.s market and they've already a door for the u.s market just [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1991.02s)]
*  to give you an example and i think this is uh it's very important it could be huge advantages [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=1997.98s)]
*  play well by a global vc you know this all sounds very positive uh what about the net the negative [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2004.5400000000002s)]
*  side though what are the threats to uh to biotech right now what are the threats for for vcs but [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2013.8200000000002s)]
*  just more generally the the industry there regina can uh can i start with you [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2020.22s)]
*  absolutely i mean basically i think the threats also need you to of course um things you can do [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2025.18s)]
*  about them and so as paulo was saying one of the threats of course we all looking to the u.s [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2031.1000000000001s)]
*  for maybe a correction of pricing that was something that people have seen on the cards [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2037.5s)]
*  anyway for a while but maybe didn't want to quite face that is coming our way and it i see this [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2042.3s)]
*  also as an opportunity for europe it's definitely an opportunity for asia as far as the market is [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2048.86s)]
*  as far as said and uh we see a lot of activities in asia but it's also like it's a chance for [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2053.98s)]
*  europe to focus on its core and science has been strong here we've got really good translational [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2059.82s)]
*  setups over here by now and also maybe just to mention that because it's something we're quite [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2064.7s)]
*  proud of as angelini ventures we are involved in several translational activities paulo is sitting [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2069.42s)]
*  on the board of a venture studio in france called argo bio uh and angelini ventures was instrumental [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2075.02s)]
*  in setting up extend which is an incubate in italy and i have the pleasure to for example be on [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2081.5s)]
*  the board of the bii in addition to my activities here at angelini ventures but also hopefully [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2087.18s)]
*  leading to some collaboration in the future which is a big translational institute in denmark [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2093.42s)]
*  so we have this infrastructure in europe and we need to use it wisely because the threat is of [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2098.3s)]
*  course that anything that can be copied easily will be copied by china or by anybody else so we [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2102.78s)]
*  haven't even talked about india we have also not talked about general companies that are being [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2108.22s)]
*  set up as copycats so what's going to be super important is that you focus on understanding [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2112.2999999999997s)]
*  biology in a deeper way that is actually meaningful for clinical development and work on those [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2117.4199999999996s)]
*  translational aspects so we're currently for example looking at an adc company which has a [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2122.3799999999997s)]
*  better adc than someone else so if you actually want to bring this to the market first of all [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2127.74s)]
*  you need to be fast and secondly you need to just have an absolutely clear clinical strategy and [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2132.9399999999996s)]
*  your pre-clinical data needs to be supporting the patient population that you go in and also [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2137.66s)]
*  kind of the readouts that you want to have along the way otherwise you cannot play in such a [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2142.8599999999997s)]
*  competitive space question is whether you need to you can also go somewhere completely differently [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2146.7799999999997s)]
*  we mentioned numin and overcourt these are opportunities that are not easily to be copied [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2152.14s)]
*  again because it's a deep understanding about the biology it's a modality that's not that easy and [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2157.2599999999998s)]
*  it is a development plan that's specifically tailored to a patient population so i think the [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2162.54s)]
*  threat of kind of copycats a lot of money in asia the threats of the u.s markets actually going to [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2167.18s)]
*  be very selective on whether they actually pay very highly priced treatments and or they will [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2173.2599999999998s)]
*  actually force price pressure on kind of the medium segment of opportunities it's just leading you to [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2178.86s)]
*  having to be very smart very selective and i think this is where in europe we have a real [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2184.3s)]
*  opportunity and i think also angelina ventures we are well positioned to really capitalize on this [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2189.26s)]
*  paulo i mean ip protections trades tariffs elections geopolitics pricing pressures regulations [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2196.2200000000003s)]
*  what's keeping you up at night [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2204.1400000000003s)]
*  well i mean there are definitely all aspects or critical aspects that [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2209.1800000000003s)]
*  uh we need to look at and consider uh you know you can do that during your due diligence but [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2215.6600000000003s)]
*  some of the future development of course they're unpredictable and they are going to transform with [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2224.6200000000003s)]
*  time so i will say i mean also regina mentioned some of of them like the the risk of a copycat [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2230.7000000000003s)]
*  of ip so i mean i think a person i think is important to be conscious and be aware [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1peTcyKeviA&t=2240.86s)]
