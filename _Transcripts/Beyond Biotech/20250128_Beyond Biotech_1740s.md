Video Description: While our podcast takes a brief break, Labiotech invites you to enjoy some of our favorite episodes. We will return with a brand-new episode on January 3rd, 2025! Have an awesome holiday season!

On this podcast, we speak to Artiva Biotherapeutics’ CEO, Fred Aslan, M.D.

The company has demonstrated the potential for efficacy and safety with natural killer (NK) cells in two cancer clinical trials. In August 2023, the company announced FDA clearance for an IND for lupus – marking a first for an allogeneic, off-the-shelf NK or CAR-T cell therapy in autoimmune disease.


AlloNK (also known as AB-101) is a non-genetically modified, cord blood-derived, allogeneic, cryopreserved, ADCC-enhancing NK cell therapy candidate for use in combination with monoclonal antibodies or innate-cell engagers in the out-patient setting. 


Artiva is investigating AlloNK in a phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety and clinical activity of AlloNK alone and in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Artiva is also investigating the safety and clinical activity of AlloNK in combination with rituximab in patients with lupus nephritis. 


In addition, Artiva is collaborating with Affimed in a phase 2, open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort study, testing a combination therapy, comprised of AlloNK and the innate cell engager AFM13, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive lymphomas. Artiva selects cord blood units with the high affinity variant of the CD16 receptor and a KIR-B haplotype for enhanced product activity. 


Using the company’s cell therapy manufacturing platform, Artiva can generate thousands of doses of pure, cryopreserved, infusion-ready NK cells from a single umbilical cord blood unit while retaining the high and consistent expression of CD16 and other activating NK receptors, without the need for engineering. AlloNK is being administered in the outpatient setting over multiple doses and multiple cycles.


Artiva’s pipeline also includes AB-201, an anti-HER2 CAR-NK cell therapy candidate for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing tumors, such as breast, gastric, and bladder cancers, and for which an IND has been allowed by FDA, and a pipeline of CAR-NK candidates targeting both solid and hematopoietic cancers. Artiva has also entered into therapeutic NK cell collaborations with Merck Sharp & Dohme.

# [Rebroadcast] The power of natural killer cells
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4)
*  Hello, while the podcast takes a week off for the holiday season, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=0.0s)]
*  LaBioTech invites you to enjoy one of our favourite past episodes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  We will return with a new episode on January 3rd 2025. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  In the meantime, have a great holiday and we hope you enjoy this interview. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=25.04s)]
*  This week we're tackling natural killer cells and the work of US headquartered Arteva Biotherapeutics. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=30.8s)]
*  And to give us an in-depth look at natural killer cells and how we can better treat conditions [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=38.56s)]
*  and diseases like cancer and lupus, our guest today is Arteva's CEO, Fred Aslan, MD. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=44.64s)]
*  So I guess the easy first question then is if you could give me a bit of background on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=53.6s)]
*  Arteva Biotherapeutics. Yeah, absolutely. So Arteva has been around for a little over four years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=57.84s)]
*  We are a San Diego based company. We are exclusively focused on the biology of NK cells. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  We have approximately 80 employees and we have raised over $200 million to date [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  by a great group of VC crossover and public investors. And I guess today we're talking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=78.48s)]
*  about some of the things that you do. I wonder if you could briefly explain [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=84.16s)]
*  natural killer cells and what they do. Yeah, absolutely. So an NK cell is a type of immune [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=88.56s)]
*  cell. It stands for natural killer cell. And just like T cells, they can be highly cytotoxic and our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=96.0s)]
*  immune system really depends on them to kill defective or foreign cells. So NK cells are also [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  important because they play a role in a mechanism called ADCC. And ADCC biology is really core to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=110.08s)]
*  what we do. So ADCC stands for antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. And this is one of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  main mechanisms by which a monoclonal antibody like rituxan works in, for example, non-Hodgkin's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=125.92s)]
*  lymphoma. So let me just review the biology quickly. So if we take a monoclonal antibody like rituxan, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=132.24s)]
*  the way it works is it binds to CD20 on the surface of a cancer cell, and then an NK cell [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=138.16s)]
*  binds to the other end of rituxan. This construct of rituxan bound to a cancer cell on one end, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  and then an NK cell on the other end activates the NK cell, leading it to release cytokines and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=153.12s)]
*  toxins, which can then kill the cancer cell. So clinically, if you have low numbers of NK cells, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=159.68s)]
*  or if they are defective, a drug like rituxan could be less effective when trying to either [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=167.92s)]
*  fight off cancer or when it's being used to kill defective cells in an autoimmune disease like [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=173.2s)]
*  lupus. So the point is, even though a monoclonal antibody can be effective, it may not have an [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=178.16s)]
*  opportunity to work as well because of poor NK cell function. So our hypothesis is that if one [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=184.32s)]
*  provides a bunch more highly active NK cells, then one could enhance the activity of antibodies [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=191.28s)]
*  like rituxan in a variety of different diseases. Could you explain a little bit more about CAR T [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=198.32s)]
*  cell therapy as well? Yeah, so CAR T cell biology is very relevant to what we're doing. As you'll [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=203.6s)]
*  see, we share a lot of similar objectives from a mechanism perspective. So CAR T, particularly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=208.8s)]
*  AutoCAR T, has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in the last 10 to 15 years. So AutoCAR T is a T [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=215.12s)]
*  cell that has been extracted from the patient and genetically modified to target specific cells. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Like NK cells, T cells are highly cytotoxic, and they're called autologous CAR T specifically [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  because you are taking these T cells from a patient and then giving them back to the patient. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=235.04s)]
*  The great thing about CAR T is that the efficacy has been really exciting. If we use non-Hodgkin's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=240.48s)]
*  lymphoma as an example, the product can drive really deep responses in patients that have seen [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  many lines of prior therapy. And in some patients, it can literally cure the disease for many years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Right? So there have been several products that have come to market, and commercially, they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=259.28s)]
*  available for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Now, the limitation is that the drug is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=264.56s)]
*  not available off the shelf. Patients typically need to be hospitalized for one to two weeks, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=271.84s)]
*  at least, in order to be administered the drug because the therapy can actually be quite toxic [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=277.12s)]
*  and life-threatening, and it's also really expensive. So those are the limitations of AutoCAR T. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=282.24s)]
*  And as you'll see as we continue the conversation, what we are trying to do is to replicate [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=288.72s)]
*  the efficacy of AutoCAR T, but with a product that is a lot more convenient, more benign, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=294.24s)]
*  less toxicity, and so on. Are we getting any closer to understanding why people respond [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=299.76s)]
*  differently to treatments? Because that's always one of the variables and great unknowns, I guess. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=306.48s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a complicated topic because I'm not sure it's any different for CAR T than it is [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=313.6s)]
*  for any therapy that's targeting late-line cancer. So as you know, cancer is a very [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=320.88s)]
*  heterogeneous disease, particularly in the late-line setting after many things have been tried, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=326.4s)]
*  So the cancer that is left is typically resistant to whatever armamentarium we have. So the question [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=331.92s)]
*  of why it may not work in some patients, it could be that there's patient variability on how they [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=339.76s)]
*  process the drug. It could be that the different tumor types are harder to get. It could be that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  the potency of the drug may not work in certain specific cancer cells that are still around. It [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=352.4s)]
*  could be that those cells have resistance to AutoCAR T. It could be the presence of some of those [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=359.12s)]
*  cells on differential tissue that the cells may not get into. So there's a host of reasons for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=365.12s)]
*  why it's so hard to eradicate the cancer. But the good news is our biotech community is developing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=371.2s)]
*  a very broad array of therapies with very different mechanisms. That way, hopefully, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=378.08s)]
*  eventually we can get to all the different ways the cancer fights back. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned some of the issues with developing therapies. What are the main challenges when it [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=386.4s)]
*  comes to developing natural color cells for treatment? Yeah, I would say the biggest challenge [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=392.4s)]
*  with NK cells is really manufacturing. And I'm going to use CAR T cells as a comparison so you [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=398.56s)]
*  understand that better. So T cells, once they're administered to patients, they can expand 100 to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=406.0s)]
*  1000 times and they can persist for weeks and sometimes months. NK cells, particularly if [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=412.72s)]
*  they're not genetically modified, they don't expand and they don't generally persist for more [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=420.48s)]
*  than one to two weeks. So if you're trying to give NK cells a chance to actually be as effective [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=426.24s)]
*  as T cells, you really need to give high doses and frequent doses of NK cells in order for them to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=433.12s)]
*  work. So you need a highly scalable manufacturing process to produce such large amounts. So let me [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=439.76s)]
*  just quantify that for you. So whereas a typical AutoCAR T dose could be around 60 million AutoCAR [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=446.0s)]
*  T cells, the highest dose that our patients are seeing in our ongoing NHL trial are 60 billion [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=454.0s)]
*  NK cells over several months. So we're comparing 60 billion to 60 million. So the productive process [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=461.2s)]
*  really needs to be a thousand times more effective. Now you could think of this being very inefficient [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=468.32s)]
*  given that you have to give a thousand times more drug, but our process is already very scalable. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=474.16s)]
*  We source today NK cells from umbilical cord units and from one umbilical cord unit, we can make [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=480.08s)]
*  trillions of NK cells. So if you can sort out the manufacturing challenges, it's very worthwhile [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=486.8s)]
*  to try this because if one can get similar efficacy with NK cell therapy, now you have an [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=493.68s)]
*  off-the-shelf product. They are safer to administer. You don't require hospitalization and so on. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned safer administration. How do you balance efficacy with safety? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=506.72s)]
*  We can think of safety as a spectrum. On one end, you can think of how rituxan is used today. So you [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=513.36s)]
*  have a community infusion center. They have rituxan stored. So it's available off the shelf. A patient [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=521.52s)]
*  will come into the infusion center. They're given rituxan. They're watched and then they go home. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=529.2s)]
*  Rituxan is generally safe. So it's very feasible to manage the patients at home and then bring them [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=535.52s)]
*  in in the unlikely event that there's some serious reaction or complication, but that's uncommon. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=541.52s)]
*  So it's much better for the patient because they get to go home. It's convenient for the community [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=546.72s)]
*  center because there are so many more community centers spread out throughout the U.S. as opposed [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  to the, you know, fewer number of specialized CAR T centers. And it's better for payers because [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  patients are not being hospitalized. On the other end of the spectrum, you have the AutoCAR T [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=563.84s)]
*  procedure. So it's really a procedure when you think about it. It starts with apheresis. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=570.1600000000001s)]
*  So apheresis is the process by which you collect the T cells. Think about it as almost like a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=576.08s)]
*  dialysis procedure where blood is taken out, it's filtered, and then it's given back to the patient. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  In this case, with apheresis, the blood is taken out, the T cells are separated out, and then the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=588.0s)]
*  rest of the blood is given back to the patient. And this can last, let's say, a couple of hours. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=593.12s)]
*  Then this sample is sent to a GMP lab. In this GMP lab, the product is genetically engineered, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=598.08s)]
*  it's expanded, and it can sometimes take up to four weeks to have the product available again for the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=604.72s)]
*  patient. People are now trying to get it down to one to two weeks, but you can see how this part of [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=611.04s)]
*  the process is particularly problematic with an aggressive cancer where the patient may not be [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=616.08s)]
*  able to wait weeks for the therapy. Then the patient needs to be hospitalized. You see, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=620.56s)]
*  the administration of CAR T can cause some serious side effects where the immune system of the patient [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=625.68s)]
*  can get out of hand, and it needs to be managed very closely because if it escalates, the patient [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=632.2399999999999s)]
*  may need to be admitted to the ICU and it can become life-threatening. So it's not ideal for a [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=638.16s)]
*  community center because they can't give the drug, they have to refer the patient on. It's not good [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  for the patient because they need to travel, they need to be hospitalized. There's the concerns [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=649.76s)]
*  around the side effects, and it's bad for payers because of how much they're spending on the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=654.4s)]
*  procedure and the hospitalized patient. Now, our NK cell therapy is closer to the example I gave [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=659.68s)]
*  you of rituximab. If the efficacy is the same, then it's almost a no-brainer. You would prefer [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=666.8s)]
*  the therapy that is off the shelf and safer and so on. But the real question, which is getting back [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=673.76s)]
*  to what you asked, is how much efficacy would you sacrifice for this preferred profile? On the one [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=679.2s)]
*  hand, you could say, well, would anyone want a less effective drug? But on the flip side, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=686.6400000000001s)]
*  we have to recognize the fact that it's been almost 10 years since the first CAR T has been approved [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=692.48s)]
*  and a majority of patients that would be eligible for NHL, they're not referred to actually do CAR T [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  because of all the negatives that I mentioned. So I think only with time after we have an [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=704.08s)]
*  opportunity as a field to actually see what efficacy we get, hopefully it's very close [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=709.2800000000001s)]
*  for the same as AutoCAR T. If not, then it becomes a judgment call of how much less efficacy is [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=714.72s)]
*  acceptable for this preferred profile. Could you go into a bit of detail about what your product, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=721.36s)]
*  AlloNK, is and how it works? Yeah, so AlloNK is Artiva's proprietary, off-the-shelf, cryopreserved [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=728.24s)]
*  NK cell. We today make vials of 1 billion NK cells per vial. It's currently shipped to a community [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=736.72s)]
*  center. It's thawed. There's a 5 to 10 minute infusion and it can be administered with monoclonal [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=745.44s)]
*  antibodies. So as I mentioned, we derive our NK cells from umbilical cord and from one umbilical [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=752.0s)]
*  cord unit, we can make trillions of NK cells. So one interesting factoid, 15% of the population [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=759.92s)]
*  has a couple of genetic variations that make their NK cells more active than the average NK cell. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=767.84s)]
*  So one of them, for example, is the affinity that the NK cell has for binding to a monoclonal [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=774.96s)]
*  antibody like Rituxim. So there are clinical trials that show that when you have this variant, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=780.64s)]
*  you have better survival when you're being treated with monoclonal antibodies. So we specifically [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=786.16s)]
*  select cord from this 15% of the population that has these two genetic variants and so all of our [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=792.08s)]
*  NK cells have this particular phenotype. We are in the clinic today with AlloNK. We're treating [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and we're planning to start a trial in lupus shortly. Both [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=806.4s)]
*  of those clinical uses have a similar mechanism where we are targeting B cells. So in cancer, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, for example, B cells become malignant, right, and you're trying to kill [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  them. In an autoimmune disease like lupus, the B cells become defective and they produce auto [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=826.56s)]
*  antibodies that start to attack your organs. And in lupus, this can be also really serious. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=832.64s)]
*  So for example, many patients with lupus nephritis, where the lupus attacks their kidney, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=837.6s)]
*  many of them go on to require dialysis and even a kidney transplant because of the severity [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=843.84s)]
*  of the disease. So our goal is to deeply kill the B cells with our AlloNK being given in combination [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=848.72s)]
*  with a monoclonal antibody like rituxan. The hypothesis is that the NK cell coming from [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=857.76s)]
*  a donor, highly active, it can enhance the activity of rituxan so that it kills B cells [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  with the same intensity as autocar T could do, right? That's the hypothesis. And if it works [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  well, then you have all the advantages we discussed before. Off the shelf, can be given in the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=876.72s)]
*  community, safer, lower cogs and so on. How often does it need to be administered? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so for our lupus trial, we will be giving three doses of AlloNK and two doses, and we're [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  starting with rituximab, which we are giving in these patients. In our NHL trial, since you're [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  trying to replicate the area under the curve of an autocar T, we have given weekly doses of 1 [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=902.08s)]
*  billion cells and now we're giving 4 billion cells and we have done that up to 16 times in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=909.12s)]
*  one patient. So there's quite a bit of flexibility. How many doses can you get from one umbilical cord? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=914.8s)]
*  So one umbilical cord can yield trillions of cells and depending on the dose that you're [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=922.24s)]
*  using on the patient, if you're using, for example, 10 billion cells per patient, then you're talking [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=928.48s)]
*  about hundreds of patients that you could treat with a single umbilical cord. And if the dose is [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=934.96s)]
*  closer to 50 billion or 60 billion, then you're talking about several dozens of patients that [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=940.72s)]
*  could be treated with one umbilical cord. You're not going to run out of potential [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=947.44s)]
*  supply of the NK cells then? No, well, that would be a phenomenal problem to have because if we think [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  about all the different blood banks that exist and all the cords that are stored, even though [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  we're selecting only cords that are in that 15% that I mentioned, there are thousands of cords [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=962.64s)]
*  that are stored just in the US, not including around the world. Can you tell me a little bit [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=968.72s)]
*  about FDA clearance and about the setup of the trials? Yeah, so very recently we announced that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=973.36s)]
*  we have an IND clear to pursue LO and K in lupus. You see the bar, I'll give you the relevance of [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=980.4s)]
*  that. The bar in cancer for all of us developing off-the-shelf products is quite high because [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=988.48s)]
*  AutoCard T has been in the market for six to seven years and we have follow-up data for many years [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=994.4s)]
*  from thousands of patients, right? So back to our discussion, how much efficacy could you sacrifice [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1000.48s)]
*  in order for a more convenient product? Well, I would say that the bar is higher if you are coming [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1006.72s)]
*  in, you know, five to 10 years behind because now you're comparing a product where you can show 10 [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1012.0s)]
*  year durability as opposed to one where, you know, most companies with an off-the-shelf product only [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1016.88s)]
*  have one or two years of follow-up, right? So it's hard to catch up. But in autoimmunity, it's a very [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1022.08s)]
*  nascent field. It was only nine to 12 months ago that a German academic group reported efficacy [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1027.2s)]
*  of AutoCard T in lupus and the efficacy was really spectacular. So we're coming on the heels [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1033.6s)]
*  of that data and currently we think we are in pole position because of this IND allowance. As far as [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1040.24s)]
*  we can tell, we are the first company with an off-the-shelf cell therapy that has IND allowance [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1047.44s)]
*  to pursue lupus using a therapy that we hope will be as efficacious as AutoCard T, but with the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1054.64s)]
*  preferred profile that we have been discussing. So our work in autoimmunity is frankly what is [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1061.92s)]
*  generating the most excitement because when you think about it, in heme indications with effective [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1068.48s)]
*  therapies, you can treat hundreds to thousands of patients, but in a single disease like lupus [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1074.08s)]
*  nephritis, you could treat tens of thousands of patients. So an order of magnitude, you know, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1080.08s)]
*  greater clinical impact. Very good news for the patients. Are there a lot of companies working [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1085.84s)]
*  in this field at the moment? I know you said you were kind of at the forefront, but is it something [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1091.6s)]
*  that lots of companies are working on? Yeah, given the efficacy seen with AutoCard T and given the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1095.84s)]
*  fact that there are many other therapies that are in development for, you know, an off-the-shelf, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1103.92s)]
*  either Card T or in case cells, we imagine that there's going to be a number of companies [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1109.84s)]
*  also entering this field. We already know that a number of them have mentioned publicly, they're [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1115.28s)]
*  beginning to evaluate this preclinically. So I wouldn't be surprised if over the next 12 to 18 [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1120.4s)]
*  months, we actually see quite a few of these entering the field. You mentioned some of the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1126.0s)]
*  advantages in the way that it's produced. Does that significantly reduce cost and improve scalability? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1131.76s)]
*  It really does very meaningfully because when you think about it, the way Card T is done today, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  you have a suite in a GMP lab that is dedicated to actually expanding and genetically engineering [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1146.24s)]
*  those T cells, but it's all for one patient. So you take the expenses of running that suite [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  and they can't be allocated across many patients. It's just one patient. But as part of our process, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  because we have an off-the-shelf process, we have the umbilical cord come in, we develop a master [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1165.1999999999998s)]
*  cell bank, and then we can via different batches produce enough drug to treat many patients. So [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1170.24s)]
*  those expenses of the suite can now be allocated across many patients. It gives us an ability to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1177.2s)]
*  actually produce at a lower cost. And if you can produce at a lower cost, that gives you some [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1184.0s)]
*  pricing flexibility. AutoCard T today is at least a half million dollar procedure. And believe it or [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1189.36s)]
*  not, it's barely profitable for the companies that actually sponsor the process because of how [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1196.32s)]
*  expensive the manufacturing is. So one of the advantages of our process, not only just the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  notions that we discussed before, but the fact that this could be a procedure that could be 80, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1209.2s)]
*  90 percent plus margins depending on where it's priced, and we could probably price lower than [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1214.3999999999999s)]
*  where AutoCard T is. What about the implications in terms of storage and transportation? Is it [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  something that you could ship around the world or would you need to replicate what you're doing [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1226.24s)]
*  now in different countries in order to be able to do that? No, it's something that's already available, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1233.04s)]
*  right? It's called cold chain logistics. It just means that the product needs to be stored, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1237.84s)]
*  whether it's in liquid nitrogen at a facility or whether you're using now more sophisticated forms [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1243.36s)]
*  of actually, for example, there's a company where you can actually place your vials of cryopreserved [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1249.36s)]
*  cell in a container. The container is fairly small like a box. You can ship it out and it stays [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1255.28s)]
*  cryopreserved until it gets received in the clinic. And over there, it can stay for a few days. It's [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1261.28s)]
*  thawed and then given to the patient. So the cold chain logistics to actually transport cryopreserved [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  products is already in place. It's not something that we have to innovate or we have to build. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1273.2s)]
*  You would theoretically be able to ship, say, to Europe, not withstanding any regulatory [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  issues, but it's easy to do? Absolutely. So there are central storage facilities throughout the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1286.4s)]
*  world that you can choose. So today, for example, we use a central storage facility in Texas. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1292.64s)]
*  And then we have all the different clinical sites that we have up and running around the country. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1297.52s)]
*  And from this central location, we ship product to all the different sites. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1301.76s)]
*  Right. I just didn't know whether it was something whereby if you were to set up in Japan, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1306.56s)]
*  whether you'd need to produce there or whether it would be more economically viable to [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1311.36s)]
*  produce what you need to produce in the location. Yeah. No, to your point, it's a purely regulatory [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1317.12s)]
*  matter. So today, we source umbilical cord units in the US from blood banks that have a BLA in place. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1324.9599999999998s)]
*  And we are able to actually use the product in the US. We're now working with the European [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1333.2s)]
*  regulatory authorities to actually have a mechanism to have the product be administered in Europe. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1338.64s)]
*  So it really is a regulatory, not a supply chain challenge. Good news too. Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1344.4s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about your collaborations and partnerships that you have ongoing. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1354.16s)]
*  Yeah. So I think our collaboration likely to yield the greatest clinical impact in the near term is [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1359.28s)]
*  actually with a company called Affymed, which you interviewed just a couple of weeks ago. Right. So [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1365.2s)]
*  Affymed has developed a biologic that enhances the activity of NK cells. But what they have seen is [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1370.56s)]
*  that the product works better if it's given with a donor derived NK cell. So this has been the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1379.04s)]
*  experience so far in Hodgkin's lymphoma. If you give the product this monotherapy, it doesn't work [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1386.16s)]
*  as well as when donor derived NK cells are also given. So Affymed selected Arctiva because of the [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1391.28s)]
*  quality, consistency, and the manufacturing of AlloNK. I think it's safe to say that AlloNK [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1398.96s)]
*  is probably today the most advanced non-genetically modified donor derived NK cell therapy product [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1406.4s)]
*  available out there. And this is why Affymed selected Arctiva. So Affymed is sponsoring a study [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1413.2s)]
*  in Hodgkin's lymphoma that will start before the end of this year. So we should see some meaningful [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1421.52s)]
*  clinical data next year. Is it something that you envisage this will be something that they maybe [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1426.8s)]
*  take every periodically to maintain their health or that you're able to cure people? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1433.52s)]
*  Time will tell. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma so far, I mentioned to you that we give weekly doses [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1441.6000000000001s)]
*  of AlloNK with a monoclonal antibody. And our patients are eligible to receive up to four cycles. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1449.0400000000002s)]
*  And then the treatment stops and we follow patients. So we have seen, I mean, our trial is [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1456.4s)]
*  relatively early, but we have seen that we have a number of patients that get responses and those [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1461.7600000000002s)]
*  responses are durable at least to within a nine to 12 month period. So time will tell whether they [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1467.04s)]
*  would need a re-treatment. For now, we're trying to figure out how long can we keep them in a deep [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  response. I would say the same thing in Hodgkin's lymphoma. As part of the Affymed trial, they're [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  giving up to three cycles and then monitoring patients for follow-up. In lupus nephritis, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1483.36s)]
*  we can give up to two cycles. This is what we have discussed with FDA, but we are hoping to give one [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1489.6s)]
*  cycle and then see what that does to the patient and how durable that is. So time will tell in [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1495.6s)]
*  different diseases what that tempo will be. And one of the advantages is that, again, because this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1502.48s)]
*  can be given in a community setting, the bar to actually having a repeat cycle should be a lot [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1508.56s)]
*  lower than considering a repeat autocartee procedure. Sure. So where do you go from here in [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1514.7199999999998s)]
*  terms of, obviously you can't give exact timelines, but what's next? Yeah, so 2024 should be a really [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1521.92s)]
*  exciting year for us across all indications. So as we talked about in autoimmunity with the IND cleared, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1528.72s)]
*  we're now recruiting sites and we hope to be dosing the first patient early next year to have some [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1535.52s)]
*  clinical data by year end. Our NHL trial continues to enroll, so we should have a nice data set and [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1542.0800000000002s)]
*  some good follow-up. So we should have an opportunity to see how durable some of the responses that we [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1549.36s)]
*  have actually are. And then as I mentioned with Affemed, the trial in Hodgkin's lymphoma is starting [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1554.7199999999998s)]
*  towards the end of this year and we should have some meaningful clinical data readout as the year [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1560.6399999999999s)]
*  progresses in 2024. So it should be a really good clinical year for us in terms of readouts across [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1568.0s)]
*  different indications. Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you wanted to mention? Like [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1574.32s)]
*  most things in biotech, you're always trying to take things to the next level, right? So again, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1581.04s)]
*  we really tip our hats to all the work that has been done with autocartee because it has actually [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1586.96s)]
*  made a really big impact to a lot of patients. We're just trying to work in a new generation [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1592.32s)]
*  of cell therapy that is a lot more benign, easier to use, much more like a monoclonal antibody, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1596.96s)]
*  and we're all here at Artiva really excited about the progress we've made so far and what's to come [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1603.68s)]
*  in 2024. You'd mentioned about the clinical trials. Is that a bottleneck? I mean, is it easy to find [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1609.2s)]
*  people or is that a challenge? You know, it's always a challenge because we are going after [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1616.0800000000002s)]
*  diseases where fortunately for patients, there is many, many, many different therapies, right, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1621.68s)]
*  that are trying to test efficacy. So I would say that whether you're talking about non-Hodgkin's [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1627.2s)]
*  lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma or lupus, there are so many ongoing trials that it's always a [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1632.88s)]
*  challenge. But generally you try to overcome that with two things. One, if you have a therapy that [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1638.8000000000002s)]
*  is likely to yield a substantially better result than what is typical, then that will help enroll [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1644.64s)]
*  patients, right? So using lupus as an example, the data that we have seen with autocartee has really [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1651.5200000000002s)]
*  cured lupus in a small subset of patients that have been tried as part of this academic study. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1657.92s)]
*  So that is more likely, a trial that has the potential to drive that level of efficacy is more [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1664.4s)]
*  likely to get the physician, the investigator, as well as the patient's attention. The second thing [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1670.72s)]
*  is you just try to go out to as many sites as you can in order to increase the chances that you can [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1676.3200000000002s)]
*  enroll patients fast enough. But I would say that is a general bottleneck for our entire field. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1681.84s)]
*  Really interesting. And I think the most important is the bottom line and that's that it's got the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  potential to help an awful lot of people more cheaply than the multi-million dollar techniques [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1693.84s)]
*  that are in use right now. So all good. Yeah, that's the plan. Stay tuned. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1699.52s)]
*  Well, I really enjoyed that conversation with Fred and a quick reminder, check out the latest news [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1704.08s)]
*  and articles over at lebiotech.eu and I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1714.8s)]
*  week ahead. Thanks for listening and you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxjzmWf9K4&t=1721.12s)]
