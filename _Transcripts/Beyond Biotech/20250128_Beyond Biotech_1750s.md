# Mending a broken heart with biotech
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 71. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly The Biotech podcast. I see records were set for the number of attendees at Bio [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=16.6s)]
*  Europe last week, so if you attended I hope it was successful and that you've recovered [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  from the event. On today's podcast we were approached with an interesting question, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=28.78s)]
*  how do you mend a broken heart? It sounds an awful lot like a song title, but in a song [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=34.38s)]
*  the answer probably isn't through biotechnology. However, French company Cell Prothera has seen [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=40.38s)]
*  some remarkable results treating people who have had a heart attack. The company's CEO, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=47.38s)]
*  Mathieu de Calva-Maten, can tell us more about how it all works and first about the company. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=52.78s)]
*  So Cell Prothera is a French company, a biotech, and is actually originally coming from an Institute [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=59.42s)]
*  of Research that is based here in Mulhouse. It's in the, we call it the, Tree Valley area, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=68.94s)]
*  it's between France, Germany and Switzerland. And there have been about 20 years of research [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  in the field of stem cells, mainly for bone marrow transplant, but at some point of time [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=81.62s)]
*  the team there was able to identify different capacities of those stem cells, which we call [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=88.1s)]
*  CD34 plus stem cells. We understood that they were not only able to regenerate blood cells, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=95.22s)]
*  white and red blood cells, but also they had progenitors of different other tissues. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=103.14s)]
*  And one of them, which is the endothelial cells, progenitor cells, which are actually the main [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=110.86s)]
*  component of any blood vessel that you have in your body. And based on that discovery, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=117.9s)]
*  the company Cell Prothera was created and we went through a first in-man pilot study, we call it, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=124.14s)]
*  where we treated with our stem cells about 10 patients. We had astonishing results, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=132.06s)]
*  just to give context about the disease we are treating, is those patients that have had a very [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=140.26s)]
*  severe heart attack with a lot of damage of the heart tissue. And there are actually not really [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  any therapeutics to repair those tissues. The only way is to take medication to reduce the speed of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=152.98s)]
*  degradation of your heart function, but there is no way to repair heart tissue because the heart has [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=160.98s)]
*  lost its regenerative capacity. So we address those patients with our product that is actually [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=167.94s)]
*  based on stem cells that we have produced ex vivo with our specific technology. And we re-inject [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=175.46s)]
*  those stem cells directly into the heart to repair the tissue so that those patients, instead of going [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=183.3s)]
*  into this very bad disease called chronic heart failure, actually recover quite early after heart [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=190.66s)]
*  attack the heart function and just live normal life. So this is a real game changer in the way to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=198.42s)]
*  treat patients after a CV heart attack. Could you tell me about the Prothera sites and how they work? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=205.78s)]
*  So Prothera sites, as you say, it's our lead product candidate. It's starting from the blood [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  sample of a patient. We go through an expansion process, ex vivo cell selection, but also cell [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=221.62s)]
*  expansion. That's multiple steps of production that then leads to this final product, which is a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  condensed large number of CD34 plus positive stem cells. The difficulty of this production of Prothera [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=238.34s)]
*  sites is the capacity to keep the stem cellness of those cells because these stem cells at, let's say, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=247.38s)]
*  native state are staying in the bone marrow very quietly and do not want to move. They are, let's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=256.74s)]
*  say, very lazy. So that's all the idea of bringing them into a system ex vivo to make them multiply, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=263.94s)]
*  expand and have a lot of them in the final product. And then what is the product Prothera site then [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=272.26s)]
*  doing? So it's actually injected straight into the heart lesion around it. And once it's there, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=278.1s)]
*  it receives signals from the lesion. And that's why it's very important to treat those patients [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=289.22s)]
*  early after the heart attack and not too late. And that's, we are one of the only groups doing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=295.70000000000005s)]
*  this. So we inject those cells within a month after the heart attack. They receive a few proteins, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  signals called chemokines, and they start to go into different directions once they are in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=309.94000000000005s)]
*  go into two different directions. One direction is they differentiate into daughter cells because [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=316.58s)]
*  they are stem cells. So they into a daughter cells and mother cells. And these daughter cells get [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=322.34s)]
*  more and more mature, transformed into an endothelial cells, which I just explained before [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=328.26s)]
*  is the main component of blood vessels. So you regenerate, you reperfuse the heart on one side [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=334.26s)]
*  with the differentiation of those stem cells, but also they are secreting a lot of different factors [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=340.26s)]
*  inside a small vesicle that is called exosomes. And those exosomes then release proteins [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  and microRNAs that are again able to boost the regeneration of small micro vessels, but also [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=355.62s)]
*  microRNA that actually are anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, so that you can preserve as many [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=366.1s)]
*  muscle tissue as you can. So these are the two effects. Secretion, it's called paracrine effect, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  and differentiation into more mature endothelial cells. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  When you apply this to the person that's had the heart attack, does that completely cure them? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=389.54s)]
*  I mean, do they need to have lifestyle changes in the same way as somebody who normally would have a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  heart attack? Well, that's why I think it's really a game changer because what we've seen in the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=403.3s)]
*  pilot study, we have been following those patients for about 12 years. Those patients had very severe [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=409.7s)]
*  heart attack, were supposed to get heart transplant for some of them, and they would have had a very [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=416.5s)]
*  limited lifespan of about three years or not more, including all medication that you could give to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=421.62s)]
*  them. And what we've seen now is this pilot study that those patients actually were still live more [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=427.86s)]
*  than 12 years later without taking all this medication that you would have to take otherwise [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=434.18s)]
*  without, of course, going through heart transplant. So there is a very strong long-term, long-lasting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  effect which is changing the lifestyle and the quality of life of those patients. A patient today [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=446.41999999999996s)]
*  with a severe damage would have to take about 10 different drugs each day. A few of them are there [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=453.14s)]
*  only to reduce the side effects of the first one, and these drugs are actually there to reduce the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=461.38s)]
*  symptoms and prolong life, but they're not really able to restore the cardiac function. So what we're [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=467.78s)]
*  doing here is really to repair. We are salvaging maximum surface of the heart. It's not that we [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=474.5s)]
*  would be pretending we're repairing 100% of the damaged tissue, but if you can already reduce by [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=483.05999999999995s)]
*  a third or so the amount of tissue that has been destroyed, it's a big, big win against this very [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=491.3s)]
*  terrible phenomenon of heart failure. So all this actually is very attractive for the patients because [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=498.66s)]
*  it's just one single treatment. It's a one-time procedure. They just have to give the blood once [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  and come to the hospital, go through very minimally invasive injection, takes about one hour [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=515.06s)]
*  and go back home. So this is a big change compared to these two, three, four, five years of compliance [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  to different medication, then re-hospitalization that comes more and more as your stages degrade. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=531.62s)]
*  In spite of that, probably the message would still be prevention is more important than cure, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=542.34s)]
*  I guess, probably still important to try and get people to change their habits. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=548.58s)]
*  For sure. That's clear that the prevention is great. We are not going to deny this, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=554.82s)]
*  but you can't really avoid to have a population that is growing older, would have ultimately [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=561.7s)]
*  still heart attacks. You can't really avoid this. Then once you have the heart attack, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  you can, of course, change your habits, change your diet and reduce the risk of another heart attack. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=574.66s)]
*  But the problem is really the damage that you have gone through with this first heart attack, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=581.94s)]
*  which is difficult to repair. So we propose here to repair it. But of course, to avoid any further [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=587.54s)]
*  heart attack, any further myocardial infarction, the diets should be changed. You may want to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=594.6600000000001s)]
*  train a little bit more, but not too much because sometimes over training for people with a weak [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=599.7800000000001s)]
*  heart could be deleterious. And so there is a combination and that's what usually your doctor [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  is going to prescribe. It's a combination of new lifestyle. But the good thing about it is if you [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=612.26s)]
*  have this repair, you can really get back to the normal life. Other diseases and conditions where [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=618.82s)]
*  this kind of therapy is or would be useful? Absolutely. This is the beauty of this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=629.5400000000001s)]
*  technology is that we're working with biologic materials, stem cells that is not predefined. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=638.1800000000001s)]
*  So it's going to behave a little bit differently depending on which environment it is in. We've [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=644.82s)]
*  been working, for example, in a different indication stroke with our colleagues in America. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=652.0200000000001s)]
*  And we are publishing next month a very nice paper about the capacity of our stem cells to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=659.38s)]
*  repair brain after a severe stroke injury. So this is working as well. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=666.58s)]
*  And again, this is a similar mechanism of actions. As soon as you have an ischemic lesion, meaning [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=674.1s)]
*  lack of perfusion, lack of oxygen, cells start to get necrotic. And that's where our stem cells are [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=680.1800000000001s)]
*  very powerful and can regenerate all the perfusion around it, commonly enough to salvage the downstream [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=686.98s)]
*  material tissue, whether it is a heart tissue or it's brain tissue. We do the same story could [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=695.06s)]
*  be done in the legs for diabetic patients. And we have a few more indications in the pipe. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=702.5799999999999s)]
*  Just kind of going back to the heart attack one, with any major thing that happens to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=710.26s)]
*  the body time is very important. How quickly do you need to work with the patient or does it [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  not really matter? It's very important to be coming within a certain time frame. We are considering [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=726.26s)]
*  about months or so. If you come too early, the lesion and the heart is so fragile and unstable [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=735.22s)]
*  that you may have too many inflammatory reactions destroying the stem cells you're trying to inject. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=744.66s)]
*  So it's good to wait a little bit. It's also good to wait to make sure those patients are really [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=750.8199999999999s)]
*  those that need the therapy because luckily there are many patients that have a heart attack and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=756.5799999999999s)]
*  will not have such a big damage would still continue living normally without developing [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=762.8199999999999s)]
*  heart failure. And we're talking about only a small population of a group of patients that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=769.46s)]
*  we could say about 15-20% of those heart attacks that really come with a severe damage. And then [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=775.46s)]
*  if you come too late, the problem is that the natural body process is in the case of the heart [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=782.98s)]
*  tissue is to replace muscle tissue by fibroid tissue scar basically which then lose completely [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=791.54s)]
*  its function, heart function. And you don't want to do that. You don't want to have that because then [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=801.14s)]
*  part of the heart is not going to be pumping blood anymore. And it's not good for the stem cell [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=806.42s)]
*  neither because the stem cell when they reach such a fibroid tissue can't really do anything. They [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=812.3399999999999s)]
*  don't receive any signals and they can't really regenerate blood vessels and heart tissues, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=818.58s)]
*  heart muscles there. So that's why it's very important to come early enough during this [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=824.58s)]
*  period where the cells are not completely replaced by fibroid tissue. Could you tell me a little bit [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=829.86s)]
*  about the whole field of regenerative therapy sort of where we're at, whether there are lots [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=837.86s)]
*  of companies involved, sort of the stage of regenerative therapies? Yes, sure. The groups [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=845.22s)]
*  working with CD34 plus stem cells today are almost none except us because that's 20 years of research [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=852.02s)]
*  how to manipulate those stem cells ex vivo is not easy. But other groups now are interested [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=860.1s)]
*  and working in cell therapy in a different condition, so different style type. I'm talking [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=868.58s)]
*  about one which is trendy at the moment is induced periproton stem cells, IPSC. There are several [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=875.14s)]
*  groups working on it trying to simplify the source of stem cells coming from mature cells back into [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=882.98s)]
*  embryonic like stem cells and then differentiating them again into mature, for example, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=891.7800000000001s)]
*  cadromyocytes or so on. There are still limitations there. Cost is one, but also the risk of tumor [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=897.86s)]
*  formation if you don't master well and don't remove all the periproton stem cells that you have [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=904.9s)]
*  in this product. You have a few people working on microRNA and RNA trying to compensate or reduce [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=910.9s)]
*  the expression of certain microRNAs in the tissue just after heart attack. And there are many people [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=920.42s)]
*  working in the chronic heart failure space which is coming much later in patients who have already [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=927.3s)]
*  developed this advanced heart failure disease and they are usually working with different style type [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=935.62s)]
*  mesenchymal stem cells or maybe even bone marrow monocle care cells. The results are quite [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=944.3399999999999s)]
*  limited because you are, as we said just before, you're coming too late. The lesion is already [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  fibrotic at that stage so you can expect to be able to repair much of the heart tissue, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=958.5s)]
*  but there are some limited effects at the surrounding area around the scar. So up to now, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=965.94s)]
*  close to phase three. We have just completed phase two. We're going to have the final readout [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=974.82s)]
*  in March next year and so we are planning for the next phase, phase three, starting [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=980.1s)]
*  end of next year. I think in that situation, advanced program, I don't see today anybody [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=985.5400000000001s)]
*  in this field of post-MI coming up at that level today. Do you think it's an area that will grow [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=993.46s)]
*  in that respect? Yeah, I'm sure as soon as there is one first pioneer company showing strong results, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1002.74s)]
*  I think this is going to be a big trend again, but there's still this waiting for the first one to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1011.0600000000001s)]
*  come in, get market approval and up to now most of the people are really doing fundamental research [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1018.1800000000001s)]
*  and there are not that many who've been able to go and prove, demonstrate with strong clinical data, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1025.86s)]
*  randomized controlled trial that we've done in this phase two trial that we're completing now, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1032.1s)]
*  that providing solid data to demonstrate that it works, but I'm sure this is going to be [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1037.6999999999998s)]
*  coming strongly. Autologous therapies as well as allogenic therapies, both of them. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1045.06s)]
*  There's so many people working in this field at a more early stage that as soon as there is a result, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1050.02s)]
*  success, sometimes also the financing an issue. So the financing will be, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1058.18s)]
*  the floor finance will certainly be released to help other companies probably to move into that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1065.0600000000002s)]
*  area. Right, you mentioned clinical trials. Where are you at with your clinical trials? I guess you [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1071.5400000000002s)]
*  just put out a press release recently about that. Yes, we had the final patient enrolled [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1078.2600000000002s)]
*  and treated with our product in September in the UK between Dundee and Edinburgh. This was the last [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1087.14s)]
*  patient. So we are waiting now for the final result. It's a six months follow up so that the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1095.46s)]
*  last patient last visit should be in March next year. Phase three trials, where are you at with [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1102.02s)]
*  preparation for that? Well, the next step is to discuss internally and with our steering committee [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1108.58s)]
*  best scenario for phase three, which will then lead to a meeting with the main authorities, FD and EMA [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1116.98s)]
*  somewhere early next year so that we can get the final feedback from them before applying [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1125.06s)]
*  for clinical trial authorization, IMD in the US. And hopefully with this in mind that we could start [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1131.62s)]
*  at the second part of next year, the phase three in a bigger scale because of course we'll need [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1141.54s)]
*  more patients. So we are planning to have a multi-center study with a lot more, five to six [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1148.66s)]
*  times more recruitment centers that we had in this phase two. And what's the regulatory pathway [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1157.46s)]
*  like for something like this? There are two pathways. Of course, the classic one, which is [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1165.54s)]
*  to go through a phase three, get market authorization, BLA in that case in the US, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1172.42s)]
*  but we can apply as we are part of these biotherapies, innovative therapies. We can apply [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1180.02s)]
*  for early market access in France already next year, which is a new program that was introduced [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1187.06s)]
*  by the French authority about a year and a half ago. And that's what we're going to do. But you [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1193.62s)]
*  can also apply for this air mat designation in the US as we are in radiative medicines, so that you [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1199.2199999999998s)]
*  get a special access to the FDA and speeding up the process of reviewing, et cetera. So we're going [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1205.9399999999998s)]
*  to take, of course, advantage of all these different programs, innovative programs that have been [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1214.8999999999999s)]
*  put in place by different regulatory authorities. But yeah, at the end of the day, a phase three [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1220.98s)]
*  is required to confirm the good result that we have in phase two in a bigger population. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1229.06s)]
*  Earlier on, you mentioned about costs, and I know that it's not exact because there are so many [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1237.6200000000001s)]
*  different things to take into consideration when you're looking at cost. But how is the cost and [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1243.7s)]
*  availability at scale? Well, thanks for that very good question, because this is the main challenge [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1250.5s)]
*  of autologous therapy, is that you're really producing one batch or one product per patient. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1257.86s)]
*  It's personalized medicine. And to keep costs under reasonable levels, we decided to invest early on [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1264.8999999999999s)]
*  into automation. There is about 30% of the overall production cost is directly related to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1275.9399999999998s)]
*  the manual operation. It's not only a problem of cost, it's also a problem of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1284.34s)]
*  quality, product quality and reliability because of risk of contamination, risk of human errors. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1290.8999999999999s)]
*  And you can't really afford to fail in the production of a personalized medicine, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1298.58s)]
*  considering that you can't really redo it, you lose your windows of opportunity and could not [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1304.74s)]
*  treat the patient. So we have to go into that direction of automation to standardize the process, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1310.66s)]
*  to reduce the risk of errors. And we have a first technology platform that we've developed the last [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1318.18s)]
*  five years, which allows to produce a few, five actually, five patients at a time. This allows us [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1324.82s)]
*  to see comfortably treatment of thousands of patients per year in different countries. But [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1334.1s)]
*  there is already a project internally that we are pushing forward to get into the next stage, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1344.58s)]
*  the next generation of technology platform that would be able to really completely scale out, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1351.54s)]
*  as we said in autologous therapy and not scale up, but scale out our production process. So that [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1358.82s)]
*  we'll be able to produce in a row in parallel, let's say a lot of batches at time. So this is [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1365.3s)]
*  actually aligned with the interest of the whole Europe to put more emphasis on bioproduction, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1375.8600000000001s)]
*  to bring new bioproduction technologies in Europe and make sure that we're not going to depend too [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1384.98s)]
*  much on the technology coming from abroad if we are to have in the future a lot of those new [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1393.14s)]
*  biotherapies used for patients. Are partnerships important in pushing this forward? Yes, it's [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1401.86s)]
*  absolutely necessary. We are experts in biology. We know how to process stem cells, but we need the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1414.02s)]
*  combined expertise of partners. That's what we've done in the current generation of [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1424.58s)]
*  platform that we have. It's a combination of different expertise. We are also involving AI, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1431.54s)]
*  mechatronic, software engineering, of course, different type of processing, bioprocessing, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1439.22s)]
*  experts. So all of this together makes a final product. And we are totally aware of the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1447.06s)]
*  necessity to have combined expertise to get to this very ambitious project through. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1454.58s)]
*  And so what's the next steps and what do you see as the timeline? Obviously you can't be exact. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1461.46s)]
*  Well, it's always about five years to get through such a big project. You have to consider that it's [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1468.6599999999999s)]
*  not only about the design, but it's the qualification under very strict GMP [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1475.54s)]
*  constraint, GMP conditions. So the old experience says that it's about five years to get some [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1482.42s)]
*  completely new technology platform available, qualified and ready to use in the clinical setting. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1489.94s)]
*  There must be a lot of excitement within the medical field for this kind of therapy and also [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1497.86s)]
*  clearly the people that are getting this treatment must be delighted to have a better outlook. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1505.54s)]
*  Absolutely. And it's a bit sad to be transparent, to get phone calls from people that have developed [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1512.58s)]
*  chronic heart failure. They had a heart attack a few months or years ago. For those patients, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1520.26s)]
*  actually, we can't do much because they are coming too late. So there is a lot of demand [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1526.42s)]
*  from the patient side. Hopefully we can already address this as early as next year with this [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1531.7s)]
*  early market access program in France so that we can give the chance, the opportunity to some [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1537.78s)]
*  patients to receive the treatment. And then of course, the medical community is waiting for [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1542.82s)]
*  these very innovative systems, solutions for patients, because it's been a long time [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1550.66s)]
*  since people have been working on trying to regenerate the heart, try to repair the heart. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1557.46s)]
*  It's been 20 years since this research has been started and there's been nothing really coming up [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1564.26s)]
*  in the market to propose that solution. So today the drugs that are coming from time to time [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1573.46s)]
*  are really there to improve the symptoms, but it's not really anything coming up trying to [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1580.74s)]
*  repair the heart. And the authorities, FDA first, have been issuing guidelines in that sense, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1587.3s)]
*  trying to push and give some open windows for very innovative therapy so that they could have some [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1594.42s)]
*  facilitated access or innovative trial designs. So there is a really [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1602.82s)]
*  big interest from the overall community on this. I think it's actually great that [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1609.86s)]
*  finally companies that are not necessarily backed up by financial support in the US can get to that [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1616.82s)]
*  level of development. It's not usual to have biotech still independent, privately owned [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1623.78s)]
*  this stage and end of phase two. And that gives us a lot of freedom to decide about strategy. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1631.86s)]
*  This is why we have been successful now in the last 10 years moving forward, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1640.02s)]
*  achieving milestone after milestone. So I think it's a good case to show that European companies [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1645.78s)]
*  can also be leading this field of very innovative biotherapies. You're making a difference to [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1653.4599999999998s)]
*  people's lives. It's clearly very rewarding. Absolutely. That's why the whole team here is [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1659.62s)]
*  having such a commitment to move forward with a higher motivation. This is the underlying [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1666.82s)]
*  goal, of course, of treating patients. I have myself, my mother, who's been exactly in that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1674.26s)]
*  situation with a very severe heart attack, not taking early enough. And now having these exact [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1681.78s)]
*  symptoms that you don't want to have. And that's what we're working. I would have hoped I had this [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1689.54s)]
*  treatment already available in the market two years earlier, so that I would be able to treat her. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1696.02s)]
*  But I think this is going to be beneficial for the next patient. And that's very motivating for the [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1702.26s)]
*  whole team. All right, some great hope there for heart attack victims, albeit not right away, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1709.54s)]
*  which is always the tough part of developing drugs and treatments. Don't forget to check out [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1719.94s)]
*  the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu. And I hope wherever in the world you are, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1724.98s)]
*  you have a great week ahead. Thanks for listening. And you'll join us again next time for another [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHycfynBhI&t=1731.22s)]
