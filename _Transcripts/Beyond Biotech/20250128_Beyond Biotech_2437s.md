# How to make vaccines affordable
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 72. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly LeBioTech podcast. And this week we have two guests from the same company and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=16.92s)]
*  that company is Phenotypica, based in Nottingham in the UK. The company does work in a lot [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=23.4s)]
*  of different areas, which we will hear about later, but the main focus today is the company's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on reducing the cost of vaccines [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=36.16s)]
*  in low and middle income countries. So to tell us about that partnership in reducing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  the cost of vaccines as well as its other work and the origins of Phenotypica are research [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=47.4s)]
*  and development director, Professor Ed Louis and the CEO, Johnny Cordener, who you will [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=54.06s)]
*  hear from first. The company is really based upon two scientific backgrounds. One is Chris [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=59.72s)]
*  Finnis and the other one is Ed, who's on the podcast with us. And they identified a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=66.4s)]
*  fusion of two technologies, which I'll let Ed explain a little bit more in detail in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=72.44s)]
*  a second. But as a consequence of the fusion of those two things, it gave a dexterity to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=77.2s)]
*  be able to bring to the manufacture of recombinant proteins a greater ability to use the full [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=82.4s)]
*  power of biology. And as a consequence of that, you can do something which I think scientists [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=89.24s)]
*  would understand, which is bespoke optimisation, genuine multi-parameter optimisation. Now, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=96.12s)]
*  all of the recombinant protein manufacture does not require that solution, but there [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=103.2s)]
*  are certain commercial and technical spots where the ability to optimise creates a premium [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  product which can command market share and is commercially valuable. And in essence, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=117.0s)]
*  what we do, we carefully scope out where the skills of our technology answer a commercially [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  and technically relevant problem and we bring it to bear in those cases. And we do two things [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=129.56s)]
*  in parallel. We generate revenue by doing things that are revenue generating, which [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=136.32s)]
*  we'll get into deeper in a second, but we also at the same time create value through [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=141.0s)]
*  product. And our technology as such doesn't create product, but when you get into collaboration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=145.04s)]
*  with synergistic technologies, the combination of the two can create very powerful and breakthrough [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  product and that's how we deploy it. So maybe Ed, can you give you a little bit of background [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  as to sort of run up to the company and the conversations that led to that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=164.12s)]
*  So Chris Finnis, one of the founders, is one of the world experts in the traditional industrial [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=169.04s)]
*  approach to yeast, baker's yeast as a microbial chassis for recombinant protein production. So [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=178.88s)]
*  baker's yeast was the first used for recombinant protein production. Insulin's been on the market [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=187.16s)]
*  made in yeast for over 40 years now, I think. And the way the market worked and the way companies [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=193.48s)]
*  worked in this area is they kept the know-how very secret. So there was only a couple of companies [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=202.6s)]
*  that were successfully making products with yeast and it closed off most of the market. So this was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  through traditional means. There was a strain that was reasonably good. Various lessons were [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=217.16s)]
*  learned either from academia or from R&D within the industries of engineering steps that would [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=225.76s)]
*  improve recombinant protein production. For example, there's a well-known protease that was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=235.04s)]
*  discovered in the 70s that is now incorporated into every production of strain and it's a long-off [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=241.92s)]
*  patent so everybody can use it. But also, you know, random mutagenesis was used. So you would mutate [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  your strain, screen for things that were better, use that for production, do more and more rounds [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=258.24s)]
*  of mutagenesis. The problem with that is it's random. You don't know what it is that the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  improvements are and because it's mutagenesis, lots of off-target detrimental things occur in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=270.24s)]
*  your strain. So that is the traditional approach. There was incremental improvements to production [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=277.64s)]
*  over the decades and it took decades to make the improvements. Chris is an expert in all of these [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=285.52s)]
*  first generation levels. So I came from an academic background. I've been a yeast geneticist, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=293.24s)]
*  molecular geneticist, genomicist for 40 years. I've recently retired from academia but I was [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=301.56s)]
*  involved in the yeast genome sequencing project, the discovery of new yeast species and in the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=308.36s)]
*  last 20 years the description of the huge amount of genetic diversity that's out there in the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=315.32s)]
*  world of yeast. So Baker's yeast is found all over the world in various ecological niches. Obviously, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=323.2s)]
*  it's been a friend to humanity for tens of thousands of years with fermentation products [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=331.8s)]
*  as well as making bread but it's been limited in the strains that were available for industry, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=342.44s)]
*  up until recently because there was a few lab strains being used. They were all related to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=353.12s)]
*  each other, generated in academic labs by crossing and those that behaved well were the ones that were [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=359.04s)]
*  taken up by industry. So industries were limited to a single or a few related strains. Whereas what [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=365.6s)]
*  I've been doing in my group for 20-25 years was to look at this wide range of genetic diversity [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=372.6s)]
*  from various places. We sequenced many genomes in the old-fashioned way. We measured traits, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=380.44s)]
*  201 traits actually, across dozens of strains. Showed there was a strong correlation between [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=389.56s)]
*  these phenotypes and the genotypes which led us to the realization that by classical breeding [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=397.72s)]
*  between these strains, we should be able to determine the underlying genetic variation that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=406.84s)]
*  underpins the improvement of a trait. So if you were making more ethanol for example or less ethanol [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  in a wine or brewing in this situation, you could not only generate strains that do this but find [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=419.96s)]
*  the underlying genetic variation that can do this. So lots of yeasty traits can be tackled this way [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=427.84s)]
*  but it also applies to non-yeast things. So if you're trying to express a protein in yeast and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=435.2s)]
*  get it secreted, that is the level of expression, the amount of secretion, the amount of post [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=441.68s)]
*  translational modifications. Those are all phenotypic traits and there is variation in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=449.48s)]
*  those phenotypic traits when you look at a wider variety of strains. So once I realized that you [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=455.44s)]
*  could very fine detail, very high resolution, determine underlying genetic variation underpinning [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=463.12s)]
*  complex traits, I started going around describing this in meetings and was invited to a Nova Zeim's, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=472.24s)]
*  Nova Nordisk annual tech fest where every R&D group from around the world got together and they [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=480.88s)]
*  would invite one or two external people to talk about the latest things. So this was about ten [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=487.88s)]
*  years ago and I was one of the invitees and Chris was there as he was working for Nova Zeim's at the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=493.56s)]
*  time. Interestingly enough or coincidentally it happened to be in a subsidiary that was here in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=500.24s)]
*  Nottingham. So he heard the talk there and a few months later I got invited to the Nottingham [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=507.0s)]
*  location at the time I was at the University of Nottingham, so very close by, and discussed the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=513.24s)]
*  potential for using breeding in addition to the traditional engineering mutagenesis approach to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=520.0s)]
*  improve recombinant protein production. Unfortunately they decided to go their own way. Chris went off [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=529.16s)]
*  on his own and a few years later came back to me and we re-discussed this, went out and found a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=537.6s)]
*  number of industries that were willing to partner with us and we tried to start a spinout from the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=543.64s)]
*  University of Leicester where I was at the time. That didn't work out but in the meantime Chris and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=550.96s)]
*  a business partner founded the company. A few months later I retired from the University and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=556.84s)]
*  became the chief scientist employee number three and we now combined the best of the off-patent [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=562.52s)]
*  traditional approach with the breeding technology which takes advantage of hundreds of thousands of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=571.6s)]
*  genetic variants that are past natural selection. These are living yeast cells so they're not [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=580.76s)]
*  detrimental, they're alive, they're robust, and by breeding we put them in multiple combinations [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=589.8s)]
*  that have never been seen by nature and always get an expansion of the phenotypic space so we [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=596.92s)]
*  always get things that are better than the original strains we put in. And not only that, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=607.0s)]
*  because we can sequence these things, we can identify down to very high resolution what [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=614.52s)]
*  combination of genetic variants on top of the known beneficial engineering give you improved [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  titer of your recombinant protein, robustness to the industrial processes, reduction in downstream [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  processing, things all of these multi-parameter optimizations that you would want. So I'm just [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=636.88s)]
*  going to finish with one thing that I always find interesting that surprises people is that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=643.64s)]
*  we're dealing with say a hundred thousand genetic variants that we're mixing up together and that's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=648.92s)]
*  equivalent to two to the 100,000 different genotypes which each all have their own phenotypic [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=656.36s)]
*  consequences of potential. That's the same as ten to the thirty thousand. There are only ten to the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=663.92s)]
*  eighty-one atoms in the universe, so we're essentially talking infinite genetic variation [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=672.16s)]
*  possibilities and we only sample ten to the ninth at a time, but ten to the ninth is enough to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=678.92s)]
*  identify the combination of thirty different genetic variants that are required for an [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=686.04s)]
*  improvement and in general experience shows the ten variants underpin most traits of interest. So [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=693.16s)]
*  our sampling is enough to get the best strain and identify the combination required to get to the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=703.0s)]
*  best strain and that combination that's identified as intellectual property either as know-how or [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  patents. Before we get to your technology could you perhaps briefly explain recombinant protein [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=717.08s)]
*  technology, what it is and how it's applicable? So the brief definition is expressing from a [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=724.96s)]
*  synthetic piece of DNA on some kind of expression vector or integrated into the genome a protein [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=734.12s)]
*  that is not found in your chassis whether it's yeast, E. coli, Chinese hamster, ovary cells, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=741.4s)]
*  insect cells, whatever your chassis is a recombinant protein is heterologous, it comes from another [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=749.56s)]
*  place. In our case they're usually human proteins but it doesn't have to be. And in the commercial [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=755.8s)]
*  context of that is that it's a rapidly expanding field across different industry sectors. In the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=761.64s)]
*  therapeutic world then it's already by far the most dominant player in terms of frontline [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=766.84s)]
*  treatments of critical diseases that will be familiar to everybody and but also the largest [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=773.96s)]
*  revenue drugs in the world the majority of those are recombinant in nature. Monoclonal [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=779.64s)]
*  antibodies but obviously you've got a burgeoning world of cell and gene therapy which are not [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=785.76s)]
*  recombinant proteins but used recombinant proteins in their processing. Insulin would be an example, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=792.16s)]
*  monoclonal would be an example, the diseases they treat would be you know everything from cancer to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=797.28s)]
*  obviously arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis etc etc. In various industrial sectors there's a great deal [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=802.56s)]
*  of interest about recombinant proteins and I guess they're looking for a catalyst that can make that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  affordable at the right levels. In some cases that's already the case, in some cases they need [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  certain technology barriers to come down of which we can be part of that discussion. For instance in [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=819.92s)]
*  skincare there's a movement, there's a lot of activity in South Korea at the moment, there's a [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=825.12s)]
*  lot of movement towards peptides and proteins and they require consistency, quality and affordability [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=830.24s)]
*  to be able to harness the potential that they bring to to skincare products. As far as vaccines are [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=838.88s)]
*  related to this, what are the issues about supply and affordability currently? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=847.28s)]
*  Well I wouldn't hold this up as being experts in all things vaccines but in this particular case [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=854.48s)]
*  albumin is a critical component of mammalian blood and it has been available for quite some [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=859.92s)]
*  time but it's derived from from animal cells in serum form. That brings with it a number of [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=867.6s)]
*  problems or can bring problems, not always but so there's been for reasons of consistency and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=874.8s)]
*  reduction of infection risk etc. there's been a premium for recombinant albumin but the recombinant [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=881.5999999999999s)]
*  albumin production in saccharomyces and baker's yeast has been classically closed out by patents, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=888.4s)]
*  the patent expired but the companies involved get the know-how close to their chest. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=894.9599999999999s)]
*  Creating a barrier to entry, they focus on a very high end of the market so the product is highly [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  priced and therefore you've got a requirement for in the production and it's actually present [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=906.32s)]
*  in the final vaccine for albumin, a preference for recombinant albumin, a need for recombinant [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=913.36s)]
*  albumin in certain parts of the world were for ethical reasons for instance with halal, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  can't have it from an all source but a deficit of supply. So our chairman was a big figure in the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=925.68s)]
*  vaccine world and he knew some of the key strategic advisors of the Gates Foundation. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=933.6s)]
*  They had identified the need for albumin at affordable levels for low and middle income to [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=940.8s)]
*  catalyse the affordability of particular vaccines starting with measles rubella for children [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=946.56s)]
*  and we're talking a lot of children I mean but talking there were the initial scoping exercise [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=953.76s)]
*  was 100 million all of which would be or pretty much all of which would be children so it's a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=958.88s)]
*  fairly significant impact that they're looking to catalyse affordability in those vaccines by [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=964.8s)]
*  bringing down the cost of this key recipient. Now I don't think the Gates, we're not privy to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  their entire strategy but I think they take a market forces type approach where what they're [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=976.88s)]
*  looking to do is ensure that supply is more readily available and therefore the consumers [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  who would be the vaccine manufacturers have got access to more affordable albumin which would [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=987.6s)]
*  then bring down the cost of the vaccines to whoever pays for them in these countries. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=993.44s)]
*  How can you help in improving all of that I guess chain? One of the things when I joined the company [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=999.12s)]
*  that was attractive to it is that it's built into the DNA of the company that what they're [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1006.24s)]
*  looking to do as well as and do other things that a normal biotech would do in terms of making [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1012.4s)]
*  return for shareholders etc is that they're looking to make key medicines more affordable to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1019.36s)]
*  vast box of the population who can't presently afford it. Now that what that means is bringing [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1026.88s)]
*  down the price of certain medicines in western markets but also in lower middle income going up [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1032.88s)]
*  beyond that threshold where for the foreseeable future realistically a lot of vast chunks of the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  population are not going to be able to afford certain medicines and can we make the difference [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1046.0s)]
*  of making them affordable. Now we're just a small company in Nottingham we can't change the world [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1051.44s)]
*  on our own but what we can do is be a critical catalyst. So if we are making these medicines [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1057.0400000000002s)]
*  manufacturer and capable of manufacturer at a price point that makes it affordable for those [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1065.2s)]
*  that pay the bills and that could well be consumers in these various countries around the world [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1071.3600000000001s)]
*  then there is no longer a convenient excuse as to why they're not bought [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  because at the moment they can't be afforded so there's no conversation to have. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1083.36s)]
*  I guess what we do is provoke that conversation that can expand beyond vaccines so there are a [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1087.2s)]
*  number of therapeutics that are now off patent or approaching being off patent for which biosimilars [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1093.84s)]
*  can be developed and we can use the full power of biology to develop those biosimilars which may be [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1101.52s)]
*  technically otherwise challenging to do or certainly technically to do it to bring down [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1108.08s)]
*  the cost substantially. That's part of our DNA of what we're trying to do and bring them [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1112.48s)]
*  down to affordable levels in different parts of the world. How that model will pay out Jim I don't [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1118.3999999999999s)]
*  know there's some big force to play but the logical model that you could see is that you [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1122.96s)]
*  have manufacturing done regionally which accords with the cost base of each region and therefore [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  it's more affordable for that region but what you don't want is a race to the bottom. So what you [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1135.6799999999998s)]
*  want is the best science, the best regulatory manufacturing practices put in place but our [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1140.56s)]
*  strains embedded in those environments can certainly achieve that so you can get world [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1146.56s)]
*  class efficiency, world class quality. The manufacturing of these is highly skilled [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1151.4399999999998s)]
*  but it's accessible skills and the building of the plant is specialised but is [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  accessible specialised so therefore you can see a regional hub type model where you can put in [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1163.84s)]
*  place strains and make things affordable to vast chunks of the world's population that are not [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1170.24s)]
*  presently available and we see ourselves as being a catalyst to that because at the moment [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1175.76s)]
*  I'm not suggesting there's big dark monsters out there in terms of these big companies but [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  they've all got shareholders to answer to so they have to behave in a way that's in accordance with [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1185.12s)]
*  that so they perhaps don't have the freedom to do certain things that we can do without technology [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1189.84s)]
*  in a more disruptive manner. Just to continue with the vaccine side a little bit, you know so we're [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1195.52s)]
*  very far along with recombinant albumin with the Gates Foundation partnership but we're also [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1202.6399999999999s)]
*  partners with Vaxhub which is this large UK consortium of academic institutions and [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1210.08s)]
*  industrial partners for developing new vaccines for a variety of diseases and we don't know what [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1217.68s)]
*  the direction is but being part of that will expand our involvement or roles in various vaccines [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  which will be beyond albumin, it'll be you know the antigen production that's used for eliciting [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1235.76s)]
*  an immune response amongst other potential other excipients that are used. Could you explain a [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1242.16s)]
*  little bit about your QTL technology, what it is and how it works? Sure there's actually a little bit [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1249.44s)]
*  of confusion and therefore some education that needs to be done in the wider community but QTL [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  technology, quantitative trait loci analysis, so if you have a population of genetically diverse [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1263.76s)]
*  individuals and you have different phenotypes say it's a disease or you know in the case of yeast [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  expression of a certain level of a recombinant protein you can associate DNA variants in the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1280.48s)]
*  genomes with the levels of trait differences that are out there. So I started out as a human [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  population geneticist over 40 years ago where we didn't have genome sequence we just had a few [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1298.24s)]
*  markers and it essentially was trying to map the few markers that were there right alleles at those [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  associated with particular diseases so I mean my the one I worked on mostly was type 1 diabetes [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1312.3999999999999s)]
*  and the HLA system as well as a few other markers and so it was a statistical association and from [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  just human populations this would be now has turned into genome wide association studies or [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1327.76s)]
*  GWAS. So QTL technology is similar to GWAS but here we generate the population through breeding [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1334.8799999999999s)]
*  so we start with a handful of original progenitor parents and we interbreed them for a number of [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1345.6s)]
*  generations mixing up the tens to hundreds of thousands of genetic variants they have between [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1354.32s)]
*  them creating this near infinite variety of genotypes and then we apply the statistical [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1362.6399999999999s)]
*  associations studies to phenotypic traits and this population of diverse individuals. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1371.04s)]
*  Traditionally agriculture say a farmer would be you know taking his best milk producing cows [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1382.4s)]
*  and breeding those with a bull that had been a father of better milk producing cows and you would [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1390.0s)]
*  you know shift the next generation population a little bit better a little bit better each time [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1398.0800000000002s)]
*  a huge industry of quantitative genetics statistics arose out of that but there was no genetics in the [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1403.5200000000002s)]
*  way that a Mendelian geneticist thinks about their I mean whereas what we're doing is every genetic [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1412.96s)]
*  variant is a Mendelian trait you can follow it you know as with Mendel's peas but there's a lot of them [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1421.0400000000002s)]
*  and together they make traits in their various combinations both complex and quantitative [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1428.56s)]
*  so you don't get all tall and all short you get you know the huge range of heights that come out [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1435.2s)]
*  in humans or peas or whatever and so our current level of technology is to apply pretty sophisticated [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1442.08s)]
*  statistical associations to a sample of sequenced individuals that have also been phenotyped and we [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1452.96s)]
*  get very high resolution mapping of markers that are associated with the improved trait and it's [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1462.08s)]
*  usually not you know it won't be one marker gives you the improvement it'll be the combination of [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1471.28s)]
*  several markers and so you need to work that out and that's only markers associated but to actually [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1476.96s)]
*  find the causal genetic variation you actually have to go in and do experiments further in the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1482.8s)]
*  lab to validate you know is it that marker is it one nearby and combinations of them can give you [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1489.36s)]
*  an improvement whereas any of the individuals on their own wouldn't give you an improvement at all [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1498.0s)]
*  so they're not predictable in the way that the classical quantitative genetics statistics would [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  tell you so you know the books of 100 years ago gave you predictability which works great for [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1512.16s)]
*  improved maize corn production milk yields but it doesn't work for some other things that were like [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1518.96s)]
*  horse racing and camel racing that higher speeds wasn't easily predicted based on this to the same [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1529.44s)]
*  level as expected so with the yeast variants underpinning the properties that we're looking [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1538.56s)]
*  at for recombinant protein production they're not predictable from the classical methods so [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1546.48s)]
*  it's a combination of using informed genetics to design the breeding and reasonably sophisticated [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1553.28s)]
*  statistical analyses from my perspective jim having worked in complex biology really for the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1563.68s)]
*  last couple of decades there's a number of realities that have come out which we can go [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1571.44s)]
*  into in greater depth if you want to but the beauty of what i saw about this approach is [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1576.16s)]
*  that you're letting evolution do the work and then you are back reading the reality of how [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1581.76s)]
*  the outcome that you're screaming for and looking for has been achieved based upon sophisticated [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1588.16s)]
*  effectively functional genomics which allows you then to to iterate again which is still allowing [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1594.24s)]
*  evolution to do the work so instead of predicting in a forward way which i think is fraught with [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1600.72s)]
*  dangerous genomics and fraught with disappointment and budgets being wasted you're letting evolution [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1606.24s)]
*  do the work and then you're figuring out how it's done it what are the benefits of this over other [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1612.0800000000002s)]
*  technologies well the first generation i sort of described a bit before so there was knowledge [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1617.92s)]
*  gleaned from a variety of experiments that say well knock this gene out and you'll get improvement [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1626.0800000000002s)]
*  so you engineer that in or change the expression pattern of some protein that's in the process [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1633.2s)]
*  that helps some gene in the the system that helps the process and that you know gives you an [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  improvement and then mutagenesis on top of that to get incremental changes which is fraught with [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1646.32s)]
*  difficulties because there will be detrimental side effects you know mutagenesis is random [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1653.28s)]
*  you'll hit the one you want after you screen but there'll be 10 or 20 or 30 other changes in the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  genome which might not be desirable and then what do you do with those how do you get rid of those [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1664.96s)]
*  it's not an easy thing to do another limitation of the first generation is that you start with a [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1672.32s)]
*  single genotype and you're moving one or two steps away from that every time so you're limiting the [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1679.04s)]
*  space that you're looking at whereas we're basically saturating the entirety of available [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  genetic space that is out there which as i've described is essentially infinite compared to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1695.12s)]
*  the number of atoms in the universe so that's the baker's yeast system there are other chassis out [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1701.76s)]
*  there that are also first generation so bacterial systems e-coli have been in the mix for decades [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1707.52s)]
*  and for certain things it's clearly the chassis of choice you get very high titers but you may [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1714.8799999999999s)]
*  also have to deal with post-translational modifications that you do or don't want that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1723.12s)]
*  aren't there as well as getting rid of toxic elements there's always an issue with bacterial [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1729.04s)]
*  systems having toxicity there's cho cells chinese hamster ovary cells mammalian cells those are well [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1737.44s)]
*  suited for proteins that need mammalian glycosylation patterns but they're expensive [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1746.56s)]
*  they're not high volume there's another yeast system pica which gives you high titers but [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1753.84s)]
*  very poor quality initially so a lot of downstream processing required and then there's some plant [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1761.52s)]
*  cell systems out there as well all of them are good for their particular purposes none of the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1767.76s)]
*  systems even our second generation system is good for everything but we certainly had improvement on [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1775.28s)]
*  the first generation yeast system and we have several advantages over many of the others one [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1782.56s)]
*  thing to always keep in mind is it's the net titer of high quality product that you want at the end [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1788.56s)]
*  and so when you only look at initial titer which could be higher in other systems if you have to [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1797.2s)]
*  spend a lot of time and effort cleaning up that product to get to your high quality product at the [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1803.36s)]
*  end you may have higher expense and end up with less net product than what we can do with our system [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1810.8s)]
*  could you tell me about the partnership with the bill and melinda gates foundation sure so quite a [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1819.28s)]
*  while ago it probably was an accidental meeting of a reasonably high up person at the gates [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1826.8s)]
*  foundation our chairman who was a vaccinologist formerly from gsk and one of our founders [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1834.16s)]
*  discussing requirements for vaccines in lower middle income countries and they came up with [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1842.4s)]
*  the one the mesas rubella vaccine that is essentially unavailable to a large part of [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1849.52s)]
*  the world because of the expense and the most expensive part was albumin recombinant albumin [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1856.48s)]
*  we had already started making it under a an iuk grant it was one of our test proteins along with [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1863.04s)]
*  a variety of others they encouraged us to write a grant that would start the process of trying to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1870.56s)]
*  produce recombinant albumin at a low cost of goods which was the major driver for the lack of supply [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1880.56s)]
*  although there was tremendous demand in lower middle income countries so we wrote the grant went [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1891.2s)]
*  through several iterations of what we thought we could produce we had some partners that were [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1896.96s)]
*  good at modeling cost of goods from both the plant side and maintaining that as well as the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1906.16s)]
*  well as the actual production side and we started out i think we had a 12 month grant to start out [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1913.04s)]
*  with various milestones which were first increased the titer from what we had because we had only [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1922.16s)]
*  just started we had low titer to have high quality it's better than the serum derived human albumin [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  was the goal and to reduce the cost of goods so this was a tremendous challenge as we were going [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1938.96s)]
*  through this we identified several technical and other challenges along the way obtained an [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1947.2800000000002s)]
*  addendum supplement to this grant to deal with a couple of those challenges and actually identified [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1954.48s)]
*  further challenges both to get the cost of goods reduced as well as reduce some of the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1962.32s)]
*  unwanted undesired byproducts that were there which would have a knock-on effect of reducing [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1970.72s)]
*  the cost of goods as well as increase the titer so we've essentially had three rounds of funding for [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1976.3999999999999s)]
*  them and we're still coming towards the end of that we met the quality goal very quickly i mean [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1981.76s)]
*  our recombinant albumin is as good as the gold standard that's out there you just can't tell [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1989.28s)]
*  the difference with the most sophisticated mass spec analysis the cost of goods we've gotten down [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=1996.8s)]
*  we haven't incorporated all the improvements there so that's you know there so the last thing is just [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2003.92s)]
*  getting the titer just a little bit higher but we're almost there and the final thing is to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2010.56s)]
*  identify a manufacturing partner to take it to the lower middle income countries we're relying on [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2015.92s)]
*  interactions with the gates foundation to identify the appropriate potential partners which will [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2023.8400000000001s)]
*  eventually i think as johnny said end up being local producers in the various lower middle income [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2029.52s)]
*  countries producing for their own markets and that's probably the best way forward and i mean [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2037.52s)]
*  this will be the first vaccine component with our our work with vex hub maybe not through the gates [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2044.8s)]
*  but you know other partners there'll be more potential to bring vaccines and vaccine components [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2052.4s)]
*  to the lower middle income country markets what kind of a timeline do you think that that will [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2059.6s)]
*  involve in terms of being able to roll this out i think this is where it sort of meets commercial [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2066.0s)]
*  reality really jim because as i said our role is really to deliver what they wanted to do to [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2071.44s)]
*  catalyze the change and we're a small organization we can't drive that catalyst of change so the best [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2076.96s)]
*  way to do this i i believe is you need a number of different players so you need the files of the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2084.32s)]
*  vaccine you require the health organizations that would be responsible for its distribution and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2089.52s)]
*  delivery into the arms of children you require the manufacturer of the vaccine and you require [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2096.16s)]
*  the manufacturer of the album the manufacturer the album has to be attracted to utilize their [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2101.3599999999997s)]
*  capacity or build the capacity for that purpose and that involves blending markets but the reason [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2107.68s)]
*  for blending markets is to drive down the cost of the album that goes into the vaccine as low as [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  possible by effectively using our some of our commercial upside as a mechanism to drive down [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  the cost and reduce the cost of the manufacturer that comes to it so we're doing our part and we'll [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2125.76s)]
*  do that but some of the parts that the ultimate customer etc can't be decided by us so that really [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2131.44s)]
*  depends on the powers that be and how quickly they move to get the vaccine manufactured and [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2137.6800000000003s)]
*  the health services lined up and whoever buys these things lined up as well there's still a bit of [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  working up to having a viable vaccine so i mean we've provided samples to academic institution [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2148.48s)]
*  that is also supported by gates that are mixing the vaccine itself with our album in to see if [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2156.16s)]
*  it works that's probably six to 12 months of just showing that it is a feasible thing and it's taken [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2163.04s)]
*  us 18 months to get to where we are it's going to be 12 months from now before it can even go to a [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2170.48s)]
*  manufacturer probably hopefully between now and then such a partner will be identified our part [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2177.68s)]
*  of the program is not the rate determining step you know we can be we can be pretty quick but [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2184.8799999999997s)]
*  in regulated environments you can only go as fast as the slowest part and some of those can drag [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2190.3999999999996s)]
*  their heels a bit clearly though that's not the only thing that you're working on what other [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2195.6s)]
*  things are you involved in at the moment well quite a variety really because one of the things [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2201.2799999999997s)]
*  i'd say is that at the core of what we do is the science the machinery the technology and just [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2206.8s)]
*  recognize peptides and proteins and optimizes accordingly it's a bit ambiguous or ubiquitous [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2212.8s)]
*  as to whether it's a skincare or it's a it's for a particular industrial purpose or whether it's [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2218.88s)]
*  for a therapeutic for that it's just a specification on which we work so our model is to collaborate [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2224.96s)]
*  and we're creating value in a number of ways the first thing you see we generate revenue by [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2231.28s)]
*  in some cases solving people's problems so producing to spec a strain that fits their criteria [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2236.8s)]
*  and then we license that strain on pre-agreed terms at the end of the contract and so we have [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2243.6000000000004s)]
*  some contracts of that nature ongoing but the way in which we create value and product is at the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2249.1200000000003s)]
*  moment in three areas one is biosimilars we've been through the entire formerly to check where [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2255.36s)]
*  our technology can produce something that gives us an edge in that marketplace there's a number [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2261.84s)]
*  of reasons why that can happen it could be to do with patents it could be to do with technical [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2267.28s)]
*  difficulty it could be with the requirement really for disruptive pricing to drive down [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2270.88s)]
*  the point of particular markets and so we're carefully building a portfolio of biosimilars [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2276.88s)]
*  based upon that evaluation of the entire formula of biological therapeutics simultaneously we're [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2282.88s)]
*  sort of closing a partnership in skincare where we've identified that there's a requirement for [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2290.08s)]
*  recombinant proteins and peptides which form ingredients that go into the final formulation [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2297.52s)]
*  so you sell a concentrate of this ingredient and they have the assays to be able to verify [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2303.84s)]
*  the activity that the skincare companies are looking for so we've got a program of key [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2309.52s)]
*  peptides or fragments of proteins that are pre-identified as an appetite in the skincare [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2316.0s)]
*  industry for we also commercializing different applications of alpone and then we have a series [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2321.04s)]
*  of collaborations that we are working up with platforms and they are to be announced they are [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2327.44s)]
*  in quite sort of exciting areas where recombinant proteins there's a requirement for the ability [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2334.16s)]
*  the dexterity of optimization to produce recombinant proteins to a particular specification [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2341.3599999999997s)]
*  and they can push back the barriers of the particular application so without giving too [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2347.52s)]
*  much away vaccines topical delivery of known therapeutics there's a couple of areas where [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2352.0s)]
*  we're quite advanced in our discussions but we're not over the finishing line yet plus we do expect [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2357.7599999999998s)]
*  to this collaboration the other our partner on the collaboration skincare side has somebody we [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2362.8799999999997s)]
*  know from our past very very sophisticated technology and they have the ability to push [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2368.56s)]
*  back the the barriers in skincare and dermatology and obviously our ability to make those to to spec [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2374.7999999999997s)]
*  is an obvious synergy in that space it's definitely often talked about the inability of low and middle [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2382.08s)]
*  income countries to have access to drugs and treatments so it's good that that's being [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5H74aw8qk&t=2393.6s)]
