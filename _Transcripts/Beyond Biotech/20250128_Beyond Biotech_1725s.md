# How quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech Podcast number 70. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly LeBioTech podcast and we're already into November. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  If you're headed to Bio Europe in Munich next week I hope it's a good event for you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=19.44s)]
*  I expect it's going to be very busy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=24.16s)]
*  The weather forecast is not the greatest weather forecast either unfortunately. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=27.2s)]
*  On today's podcast we're talking with Jean-Philippe Picamal, the chief scientific officer and co-founder [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=30.8s)]
*  of French headquartered company Qubit Pharmaceuticals. We'll be talking about how [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=37.44s)]
*  quantum computing is accelerating drug discovery and how the company's Atlas platform is leading [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  the way to more effective and safer drugs. All right well I guess we'll start with the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=50.16s)]
*  easiest question first if you could tell me something about the company. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  So yes, our company is called Qubit Pharmaceuticals. It has been founded in 2020. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=62.48s)]
*  Its main idea is to be a digital pharma. So what does that mean? It means that we [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  don't have wet labs. We are using computers and we are using these computers to predict new drugs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=79.52s)]
*  So we are making the plans of the new drugs, new treatments and based on the prediction that we are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=87.44s)]
*  doing with our computers or supercomputers we are making the the synthesis of these compounds [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=94.96s)]
*  and we hope to to be able to discover at an accelerated rate various new drugs for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=101.76s)]
*  various diseases in practice. And could you tell me about the Atlas software that you have and how [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  it works? Yeah so to do so of course you need supercomputers but on these supercomputers and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  even some quantum computers because that's part of our name the Qubit is coming from quantum computing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  We need a software and that's what it's called Atlas. So that's a computational platform that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=131.52s)]
*  is able to do many different types of computation and that replace in fact the lab. So we don't have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=138.0s)]
*  or in our everyday life we don't have a lab where people are going some doing some synthesis but they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=147.36s)]
*  are performing computation on their screens so they can visualize the molecules they can modify [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=155.44s)]
*  the molecules and they can compute a lot of properties towards the idea that we will see [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=161.52s)]
*  in the computer the drug interacting with its target. So Atlas is doing all of that so it's like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=168.48s)]
*  a Swiss knife with a on rods of different methods and very strong computational capabilities to be [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=175.76s)]
*  able to handle the largest supercomputers because in fact the goal of the company is to do [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=184.96s)]
*  all this prediction very accurately but also to do it fast because that's the pharma world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=192.88s)]
*  So we need to be able to screen a lot of molecules and to find the right one and in order to find [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=200.4s)]
*  the right one you must in fact make a lot of attempts and because in real world in pharma [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  the difficulty is when you do an attempt it is done in the lab so it has a serious cost [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=214.32s)]
*  and you need a human to do so. Within the computer let's say that you can you can fail a thousand [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  times it doesn't cost much and that's in fact the spirit of qubit pharmaceuticals so we will try to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=229.76s)]
*  fail a lot in the computer in order to find the right candidate, the right drug. Right I guess [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  a lot of this is failure we only hear about the successes but I guess the most important thing is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=244.48s)]
*  being able to fail quickly and work quickly. Exactly so that's the dilemma of pharma [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=251.6s)]
*  is that in pharma people are finding a lot of drugs but they are never or are really perfect. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=259.36s)]
*  They have difficulties to be sensitized, their cost of synthesis may be too expensive [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=266.32s)]
*  for an industrial perspective, they may have toxicity, they may have side effects and we [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=273.44s)]
*  you know it only at the end. So the idea is to be able to produce as many new ideas as we can [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=280.48s)]
*  at light speed so we have a lot of candidates and these candidates can be moved in fact [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=286.96s)]
*  to synthesis and to the other phases of pharma but with the idea that probably 99.9 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=294.88s)]
*  initial ideas will be already validated as failures. So we that's exactly what we want to do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=302.96s)]
*  We want to fail as much as possible in the computer in order to not fail when we come to the real world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=310.56s)]
*  Through looking at your press releases and website digital twins comes up a lot. Could [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=318.32s)]
*  you explain what digital twins are? Yeah so the digital twin is really the idea that you will have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=324.08s)]
*  a model a computational model that will be as good as the real object. So in pharma usually what we [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=330.56s)]
*  are trying to digitalize as twins is the target of the drug and what is the target of a drug in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=341.2s)]
*  pharma is a protein. So protein has a 3d structure that you can get from experiments so you have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=349.12s)]
*  atoms of different types and this protein or this ensemble of protein is a part of your body and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  that's the part of your body that you want to heal and you need to find the drug and to find [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  its location into this target. So when you look at that in terms of surface it's a little bit [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=369.2s)]
*  like the surface of the moon or the surface of a planet like mars. There is a lot of different [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=375.68s)]
*  locations your drug can be anywhere and so the digital twin its purpose is to reproduce that in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=383.28s)]
*  the computer so you can explore in fact the surface of this target to find the best location of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  drug. So that's a double problem you have to find the drug and then to find its location so that's a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=396.8s)]
*  tough problem and that's why you need a lot of computation to do all this attempt to locate and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=405.12s)]
*  to find the drug. Can you tell me how you're trying to work towards improving safety and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=411.44s)]
*  increasing drug discovery and also reducing cost and also sort of what kind of amounts you're [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=418.8s)]
*  looking towards in terms of those reductions whether it's 50 percent 20 percent that kind of thing? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=426.72s)]
*  So first in term of speed so technically this computation can reduce by a factor five to ten [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=433.68s)]
*  the speed of development because in fact the computer are fast enough so you will be able [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=441.76s)]
*  to do a lot of candidate. What cannot be fully reduced is the human intervention you still need [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=450.56s)]
*  human so even if the computer are doing that in a few hours or few days you still need people like [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  to discuss what is the best strategy etc so there is a limit to the reduction but it will [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  considerably accelerate the time to solution in terms of discovery of new molecules. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=469.12s)]
*  Then in term of what this molecule does you have a over layers of software and technology that can [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=475.76s)]
*  really help you for example you have the machine learning so the machine learning is able to learn [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=484.4s)]
*  based on data that you can find either in previous projects or in other [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=490.24s)]
*  scientific projects it is able to make predictions about side effects toxicity solubility of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  molecule in the human plasma etc so basically the you have several layers of computational methods [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=505.04s)]
*  that are already enabling you to make predictions before the experiment and the machine learning [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=513.44s)]
*  is a big part of it and over time we will see in the future that really most of the properties [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=521.44s)]
*  of a drug will be already relatively well predicted before it has even seen real world. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  What are the areas that you're concentrating on because obviously there are so many diseases [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  and so many potential drugs for those diseases how do you narrow it down in that respect? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  So one idea of the company is that that's exactly what you said there are so many [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=552.0s)]
*  possibilities that we should not first tackle the diseases where in fact many people have already [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=558.16s)]
*  solutions so that there are some area of research where in fact some existing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=566.48s)]
*  methodology is already working pretty well so it's really crowded maybe the investment is not worth [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=573.44s)]
*  what we are specialized in we are specialized in the disease where drug ability is highly difficult [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  where in fact no pharma has a real clue we made choices so we are working on three different [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  areas of specialization cancer because it's within cancer you have very difficult cancer [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=598.64s)]
*  and that could be a plus for for patients if we find something inflammation because you have a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=604.64s)]
*  variety of very complex diseases where it's not very easy to find new treatments and virology [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=610.96s)]
*  we all know everybody knows about covid now but that's something where in fact the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=623.2s)]
*  the accuracy of methodology is really important because sometimes you really want to to find a [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=629.36s)]
*  quickly and so that's also something we are tackling so these three areas cancer inflammation [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=635.52s)]
*  and virology could you tell me about some of the successes that you've had so far [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  most of we do is confidential because you only hear about that once the molecule is going into [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=648.4799999999999s)]
*  a big pharma and the big pharma is making the announcement but as a proof of concept we did [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=655.92s)]
*  something that has been widely shared it was on covid so for example in 2020 it was the launch [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=660.4s)]
*  of the company there was a global call for startups like us and the research labs to look at [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=669.04s)]
*  anti-virals it's almost forgotten now but in 2020 we had virtually no idea about what's what's going [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=676.88s)]
*  on and everybody was looking for a countermeasure against the virus that is causing covid 19 [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=684.72s)]
*  and so we had an early version of the atlas platform and we launched our computation [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=693.04s)]
*  on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we targeted a specific protein that is called the mpro [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=702.24s)]
*  the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that is a drug would block the replication of the virus if [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=709.36s)]
*  it was functional within six months in fact we managed to find two families of new drugs [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=716.64s)]
*  antivirus we managed to do the synthesis of this drug and the test on the virus with all the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  characterization and when it was the time of making conclusion about this research before [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=730.96s)]
*  it was in 2022 two years later we were in the 10 groups or companies in france that have been able [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  to to produce new things on covid so that really showed that this technological transformation [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  using supercomputing a lot of physics and machine learning is really able to produce new things in [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=757.36s)]
*  pharma especially because when you have a time constraint and it was the case during covid it [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  works or it does not work so that's what we were able to demonstrate that first our technology was [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=771.84s)]
*  working and we were able to go up to the lab to make the drug happen and to make the test the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=778.88s)]
*  biological test on a real life problem so our drug was really efficient and we were also able [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=785.28s)]
*  to to publish so that was a little bit of white paper or proof of concept research work that we [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  shared with the world i guess with covid having well i mean it's still around but hopefully the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=799.12s)]
*  worst is behind us but i guess that utilizing platforms such as the ones that you have will be [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=807.04s)]
*  useful if there's another pandemic in the future so that was exactly the point of doing this research [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=814.96s)]
*  because of course we grew a little bit so we are still a but we are still a small company and it [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=823.12s)]
*  was it has never been the point to be competitive against phizer but we demonstrated that we could [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  do a drug very fast and so as you said virology is a very large subject so you have a lot of viruses [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=836.16s)]
*  it's 100 sure that something will happen in the in the coming years so we don't know it yet [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=846.48s)]
*  and maybe it won't be as bad as covid but it remains really important to have some [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=854.8s)]
*  technologies that are cutting the time of development of new drugs and antivirals in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=862.4s)]
*  fact are important for everything and for example the technology that we are developing is [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=868.4s)]
*  can be used also for virus that are not of the pandemic not generating pandemics but you have [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=874.64s)]
*  other virus viruses you have aids you have airpiece you have things like that and you need antivirals [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=881.92s)]
*  so the technology that allows you to work on antivirals is really important and to a large [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=888.0s)]
*  extent extend for the population this is an area that is artificial intelligence and machine learning [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=894.72s)]
*  and quantum computing starts to take off there are more and more companies entering into this field [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=902.72s)]
*  how are you able to i guess stay ahead of the companies that are entering this field our [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=909.6s)]
*  specificity is that we are coming from academia so our company has been funded by five different [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=915.44s)]
*  academic founders in two countries related to five labs so we are all guys in the field and [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=922.32s)]
*  our academic laboratories have accumulated over the years really a lot of different technologies [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=930.96s)]
*  and we're still heavily working at the academic level to keep an edge on all of that so of course [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  you have a new players you have big players like google but it's a complex field so it's a little [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=944.0s)]
*  bit like a decathlon marathon you have to run a very long time and you have to master a lot of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=951.68s)]
*  different types of techniques including super computing and quantum computing so a company [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=959.2s)]
*  like us that is highly technological has a capability to keep an edge even on [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  on very large competitors the nice thing with that is this i would say digitalization of pharma is [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=974.08s)]
*  is disruptive so we can really do things with small teams that would have required a lot of people [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=982.08s)]
*  some years ago so with the the increase of compute and everybody is talking about [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=989.44s)]
*  the increase of compute because of the chat gpt etc and people have started to realize that [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=995.84s)]
*  in fact we needed a big computers to build these chat gpt models but the same technology is also [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1002.96s)]
*  able to to build a new model for pharma so we are at the age of a new era where things will go a lot [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  faster even for the development of drugs and i guess as you mentioned earlier there are many [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1019.6s)]
*  companies but there are so many diseases that it's not going to be a field where it's oversaturated [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1026.24s)]
*  because there are just so many diseases to tackle exactly so all the technologies will not be able [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1034.24s)]
*  to deal with every target every diseases not everyone is interested by the same thing [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  not everyone will have access to the largest supercomputer because technical difficulties [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1048.0s)]
*  will remain but there is a lot of room for i would say a full family of companies doing different [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1052.88s)]
*  things we are only dealing now with the revolution of machine learning there is another one coming [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1060.48s)]
*  which is the next revolution of quantum computing so we will have good years with increased [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1067.44s)]
*  capabilities and so i think like digital pharma will flourish and help more and more people to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1074.0s)]
*  get cured and that's really what we hope for it's like we know that old style pharma was working [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1082.0s)]
*  very well but it was slow because due to the complexity of the task to achieve and this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1089.68s)]
*  computational revolution will really unleash the power of pharma towards really helping a lot more [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1099.9199999999998s)]
*  people and with that revolution and the changes and developments in computing do you have to [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1107.4399999999998s)]
*  constantly be working with that to change the atlas software exactly so i would say one [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1117.28s)]
*  particular aspect of atlas it has been designed to be hardware agnostic so what does that mean [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1126.88s)]
*  is that we know that the field is evolving at light speed you have every week new announcements [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1133.5200000000002s)]
*  you see huge progresses by company like nvidia you see quantum computers coming and there are no [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1141.44s)]
*  design but very large corporations like ibm or google so we need to make sure that we are [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1150.56s)]
*  state of the art and that we keep our age so we have a software that is constantly evolving [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1157.52s)]
*  so a company like us is like you know this chocolate candy you have several layers so outside [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1164.4s)]
*  we look at pharma but inside we are a deep tech company really like google so we have [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1171.28s)]
*  computer scientists high performance computing specialists theoretical physicists theoretical [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1176.64s)]
*  chemists and quantum physicists and all these people are working really hard only on the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1182.56s)]
*  technological aspect to be able to deliver in fact a platform for the internal users that will [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1189.44s)]
*  actually do the pharma so that's a model of company which is a clearly hybrid by construction [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1196.8s)]
*  and that requires really to follow the trend and to anticipate the trend of the deep tech world [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1204.0s)]
*  do pharma companies approach you to work with the software or how do those relationships develop [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1211.68s)]
*  so we make a choice at the beginning not to be selling the software for various reasons because [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1219.52s)]
*  if you enter the software market you're clearly in competition with a lot of people that are willing [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1227.7600000000002s)]
*  to sell this software and that's not what we want we want to be able to contribute to the overall [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  effort so we are doing a lot of open source development that we share with both academia [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1240.4s)]
*  and the industry and our model is to really sell molecules so we we go directly to the molecules [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1246.72s)]
*  we find new families of drugs that are unknown to the big players and we are specializing [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1255.5200000000002s)]
*  ourselves in the clinical phases that we call the pre-clinical phases that means that we find a [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1262.4s)]
*  molecule we define its structure we synthesize it we do the first test that are before the animal [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1268.8000000000002s)]
*  i would say they have an in vivo test but there are cellular models toxicity etc and when we have [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  i would say a full book of the description of the molecules we sell them to bigger players that have [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1285.6000000000001s)]
*  the capability to to do the clinical trials because in the clinical trial that's where you [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1293.28s)]
*  go to the test on on humans and that's where you need a specific knowledge and very large capabilities [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1299.3600000000001s)]
*  to handle that so it's not our job we stay at the discovery level but we aim to be able to produce [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1306.96s)]
*  more diversity in the type of molecules we can find the most recent news out of your company was [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1313.84s)]
*  i guess the partnership with pascal and the quantum for bio program could you tell me [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1322.32s)]
*  a bit about that yeah so so that's a another aspect of what we do so we partner with some [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1327.76s)]
*  pharma and they will acquire our molecules but we also partner with deep tech companies and the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1336.8s)]
*  quantum for bio project is an aspect of that so what was the idea of the collaboration with [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1344.32s)]
*  pascal is to prepare clearly to prepare the future so we strongly believe that as we partner with [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1350.1599999999999s)]
*  pharma to develop new drugs we need to partner with our hardware provider to develop the next [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1356.6399999999999s)]
*  generation of platform and the next generation of platform will include the computational aspect [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1362.0s)]
*  that are beyond classical computing so beyond gpus and cpus and and tpus we will need quantum [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1368.8s)]
*  processors so we had already a past project at the beginning of the company with pascal it went well [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1375.68s)]
*  we decided in fact to group with pascal and another collaboration that is a unit the unit [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1383.44s)]
*  tariff form that is a non-profit company that is aiming to to spread quantum computing and the idea [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1391.28s)]
*  was to build an alliance to be able to decipher what we really needed to use quantum computing [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1399.84s)]
*  for pharma applications so we had a specialist in programming of different standards which is [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1408.32s)]
*  unitary phone an artwork provider that is pascal so pascal is building quantum computers based on [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1416.1599999999999s)]
*  cold atoms that are using in a read back state so originally they have been funded by alain [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  spey who got a noble prize very recently and we are the specialist of algorithmics for pharma [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1431.6s)]
*  and we have applied to this welcome trust funding so it was a global competition [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  and we got it so we were the only europeans so that's a very good news so that shows that first [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1448.4s)]
*  we have a technology that is competitive and then it's giving us time and resources to [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  to really do very deep tech work to really link our computational infrastructure to state of the [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1462.0s)]
*  art the hardware you really really need to understand the hardware at the deepest level [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1472.0s)]
*  if you want to to build this new generation of platforms the next 12 to 18 months what does that [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1477.84s)]
*  look like for the company so the company is growing so we started we were three people now [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1483.76s)]
*  we are 60 so next year it will be a new phase of growth more projects more collaboration so [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1492.56s)]
*  we will announce different partnerships both with the academic partners in the field of pharma but [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1501.68s)]
*  also in the field of deep tech so we are continuing to really look at the new type of [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1510.8s)]
*  drugs for the areas of that we that i explained and also we are going more and more deep tech [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1519.12s)]
*  this first four years i would say we finalize a very large scale very large capabilities using [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  a supercomputer and the second phase is really go quantum we are building a second version of [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  atlas that is more quantum that will of course continue to use classical computing [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1542.4s)]
*  but we are working out our computational capabilities to tackle more and more complex [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1548.8000000000002s)]
*  projects hopefully at the end of that many more drugs to help more people i guess [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1554.4s)]
*  yeah that's exactly the goal and what is interesting right now is that so we are [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  probably one of the first hybrid company between deep tech and pharma but we are not the first [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1566.88s)]
*  company between pharma and artificial intelligence so you are starting to see now so not all the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1574.72s)]
*  initial company are still there but some of them have been growing and they are starting to show [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1582.8000000000002s)]
*  their first results so that's interesting because that means that you know pharma is slow you have [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1588.8s)]
*  cycles of 15 years of development but you you start to see announcements about clinical trials [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1594.32s)]
*  of drugs that have been partially designed by artificial intelligence so that's really exciting [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1602.32s)]
*  so that means that pharma is already transforming and we are working hard on the next step of the [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1610.08s)]
*  transformation to reduce even further the time to solution but the overall process of pharma [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1618.16s)]
*  is really already in a full transformation artificial intelligence is there and it will mix with [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  high performance computing and quantum computing to build the pharma of tomorrow again i really [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1632.5600000000002s)]
*  think that the ultimate goal is really to to find drugs that will be useful for people [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  covid reminded us how fragile we were so sometimes you need a solution that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1644.8000000000002s)]
*  you need a solution now so i think a lot of people are interested and are reading about pharma because [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1651.76s)]
*  they hope that a drug will be developed for that specific case and i think this overall effort [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1658.5600000000002s)]
*  will really bring a little bit more hope i think that's that's good it's really motivating i [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1669.04s)]
*  think for all the companies like us to pursue that direction [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1674.72s)]
*  well let's hope cubit is successful in getting more drugs to market more quickly and of course [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1689.84s)]
*  the bottom line is helping more patients don't forget to check out the latest news and articles [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1695.84s)]
*  over at the biotech.eu and i hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1701.36s)]
*  thanks for listening and you'll join us next time for another beyond biotech [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij0gXxJUtc4&t=1708.08s)]
