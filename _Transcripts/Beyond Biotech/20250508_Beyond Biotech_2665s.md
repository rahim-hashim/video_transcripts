Video Description: Flagship Pioneering doesn't go out to find the next big thing in biotech when investing their billions in fund capital - instead, they take a different route.

Flagship Pioneering has founded more than 100 companies in the life sciences worth in total an estimated $75 billion. With a proven model for biotech startup success and a culture designed to surface new and interesting ideas, Flagship offers a different approach to biotech funding that is paying off time and again.

In this episode I talk with Lovisa Afzelius, a General Partner at Flagship, uncover the ways in which Flagship is shaking up the biotech funding model, and come to understand the reasons why others will have a hard time imitating its success.

This episode is brought to you by Jubilant Biosys (https://www.jubilantbiosys.com) .

*  This week on the podcast, I sit down with flagship pioneering, Lovisa Avselius. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=70.84s)]
*  Lovisa is a general partner and a leader of one of flagship's business units, and she [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=76.08s)]
*  joined me to explain how flagship's unique approach to founding biotech businesses works [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=80.84s)]
*  and why it's established such a track record of success. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=86.0s)]
*  Lovisa describes a process by which flagship generates new ideas, funds those ideas and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=90.0s)]
*  moves their companies towards Series B fundraising and beyond. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=95.44s)]
*  Will others imitate this entrepreneurial model? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Find out why Lovisa thinks they should, but also why they probably won't. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=102.34s)]
*  I hope you enjoy my chat with Lovisa Avselius. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=107.0s)]
*  Lovisa, thanks for joining us on Beyond Biotech. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=110.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me, Darlene. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=116.16s)]
*  I really want to get started by learning a little bit about your journey into biotech [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=118.16s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=122.24s)]
*  You came, you started off in Sweden, you did some academic work in chemistry. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=123.88s)]
*  What really sparked your passion for biotech? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=128.82s)]
*  Well, that's a good question. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=131.64s)]
*  So I've always been passionate about solving big problems and I think that's where biotech [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=134.9s)]
*  really is so unique that every day you go to work and you do something to address the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=142.38s)]
*  biggest problems, unmet patient need, etc. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=150.6s)]
*  And when I started off with my, I actually started off an industrial PhD with AstraZeneca [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=154.24s)]
*  back in Gothenburg at that time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=161.8s)]
*  And it was really to build something very new, which was an interface between biology, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=165.88s)]
*  chemistry and computational. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=173.68s)]
*  And I would say that the idea of being sort of unbiased in your endeavors to identify [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=177.0s)]
*  novel solutions was very attractive to me. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=184.48s)]
*  And I think that first project in this late 1990s really sort of captured my interest [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=187.72s)]
*  and was the reason for me pursuing a career within biotech or since then. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=194.62s)]
*  And it was that vision of being able to simulate and build novel insights in silico that really [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=203.3s)]
*  drove that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=210.06s)]
*  You mentioned AstraZeneca, but I think you also did a little bit of work at Pfizer as [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=211.62s)]
*  well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=216.06s)]
*  How did working for really big pharma firms give you some perspective on biotech? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=217.62s)]
*  It's obviously very different from some of the startups that you're working with today. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=222.34s)]
*  So I would say that both AstraZeneca and Pfizer and these big pharma, they are extremely good [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=227.84s)]
*  learning schools because in that sense that you have the chance to go through so many [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=232.54s)]
*  different projects simultaneously at different stages. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=236.66s)]
*  So I worked all the way from the very, very early stages, HIT identification, all the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=239.84s)]
*  way through to clinical development and have had the chance to bring now with several of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=244.5s)]
*  those drugs now being on the market. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=250.38s)]
*  That just gives you the ability to look at problems from many different directions and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=252.66s)]
*  be exposed to a lot of different scenarios. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=257.5s)]
*  And that goes also that these biotech or these pharma are many times across multiple different [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=261.1s)]
*  disease areas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=267.14s)]
*  So that's also given me the opportunity to first start off in cardiovascular metabolic [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=268.5s)]
*  diseases, but then move into neurodegenerative diseases and CNS and then move on to inflammation [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=273.54s)]
*  immunology and now focusing also on infectious diseases as well as broadly across that spectra [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=279.46s)]
*  that I was just mentioning. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=286.46s)]
*  But that exposure, I think, is a very, very good learning school from big pharma for sure. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=287.9s)]
*  But then you jump out of big pharma and into some really entrepreneurial work. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=296.66s)]
*  I think it was Elsa.Science. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=301.38s)]
*  How do you go from one of the biggest pharma companies in the world to something so entrepreneurial [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=302.38s)]
*  and much more agile? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=309.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  So it actually started off earlier. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  So it started off in beginning of 2010 or actually 2013 when I became CEO of a small [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=313.58s)]
*  startup in Sweden in neurodegenerative diseases. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=320.9s)]
*  And I got a scholarship to do an MBA because as a first time CEO, there was a lot I really [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=324.7s)]
*  did not know about how to run a company and in particular not a small startup. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=332.58s)]
*  And in the same time, I was also soon after I was recruited to Pfizer in the U.S. and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=338.94s)]
*  we moved here and I asked if I could keep that scholarship and actually pursue my MBA [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=344.74s)]
*  here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=350.74s)]
*  And they said that was OK. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=351.82s)]
*  So I enrolled to MIT and that was a very, very good school for actually becoming much [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=353.06s)]
*  more aware of that there is a whole life science ecosystem outside of the big pharma, because [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=360.06s)]
*  when you are in big pharma, it's very easy that all you see is that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=368.06s)]
*  And one of actually the teachers during that MBA was Noura Feen, who is the CEO and founder [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=372.34s)]
*  of Flagship Pioneering. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=379.34s)]
*  He gave a lecture on entrepreneurship and pioneering. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=381.94s)]
*  And I think that really opened my eyes to think about innovation very differently from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=385.73999999999995s)]
*  what I've ever been thinking about it before. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  And the idea of actually being able to institutionalize the process of innovation and entrepreneur. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=395.34s)]
*  And that made me very excited about exploring further what that would be like. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=402.34s)]
*  So I left big pharma and I joined one of the ecosystem startups and had the possibility [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=409.34s)]
*  over the coming years to really build out from being four people, moving from the 85,000 [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=415.34s)]
*  people at Pfizer to four people in the startup, raising a serious B in the business, and then [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=422.34s)]
*  moving into clinic. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=429.34s)]
*  And that's when I was asked also then after if I wanted to come on board to Flagship Pioneering [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=435.34s)]
*  and do that repeatedly over and over and over again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  Are they really different modes of thinking? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=443.34s)]
*  I mean, on one side, you've got the really 85,000 person pharma firm in the four person [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=446.26s)]
*  startup, but you've also got the science led thinking of a lab researcher who's just looking [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=451.78s)]
*  for the answer versus the entrepreneurial mindset of, well, we've got to actually make [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=458.06s)]
*  some money out of this at some point. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=463.2s)]
*  How do those different thought processes fit together? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=465.48s)]
*  Is it something easy to do? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=467.8s)]
*  So that's a very good question. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=471.96s)]
*  And it's a very important question because you always have to have value creation in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=474.54s)]
*  mind. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=478.38s)]
*  And for me, patient unmet need, if you do something that unlocks an unmet need and serves [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=479.38s)]
*  patients, you are creating value. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=488.34s)]
*  And oftentimes I feel like that is one of the best ways of really connecting what you're [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=491.06s)]
*  doing in the lab to the value creation, which is also easily explainable as you're sitting [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=496.9s)]
*  as groups in these companies to make that bridge. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  We've heard a little bit about you now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=510.38s)]
*  Maybe we should jump in and learn a little bit about what Flagship Pioneering is all about. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=513.06s)]
*  It's not your typical VC firm, is that right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=518.26s)]
*  That is right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  We're not that all. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  I would call us a venture creation firm. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  So we're similar to others in that we raise funds. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=525.58s)]
*  So we have our Fund 7 and Fund 8 out of which we fund our companies. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=529.66s)]
*  So while others are investing in or co-investing with in already existing companies, what is [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=535.84s)]
*  critical to Flagship is that we build our companies ourselves internally. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  And we fund them ourselves up until about a Series B. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=548.24s)]
*  So what Flagship has built is really the ability to have both this very, very strong science [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  and ability to build platforms together with knowledge around entrepreneurship and pioneering, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=564.44s)]
*  but also bringing the capital to the table so that you can actually do what you need [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=573.4799999999999s)]
*  to do and not what you can necessarily afford to do, which is otherwise what happens when [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=577.88s)]
*  you're in a much more spoon-fed financing environment. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=583.12s)]
*  And in doing so, we can create and we can build these platform companies. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=587.76s)]
*  And we truly believe in platform companies, which are platforms that you can literally [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=592.68s)]
*  point towards multiple different areas of value because it allows you because when we [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=597.76s)]
*  think about risk, I mean, there are many different risks when you do small startups, you can [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=605.36s)]
*  think about biology risk and technology risk and financing risk and execution risk. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=609.56s)]
*  And if we can mitigate much more on the technology and financing risk and execution risk by having [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=614.48s)]
*  a process in place, how we do this repeatedly, we can focus on the biology risk with platforms [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=621.04s)]
*  where we can mitigate the biology risk by actually having a platform that can go towards [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  many different biologies because if one biology doesn't read out, we can always sort of point [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  the platform towards another area of biology. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=640.12s)]
*  So that's just one aspect of Flagship. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think that there is also another very important aspect of Flagship that I'd love [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=648.48s)]
*  to bring up, which is how we are always looking for value beyond adjacencies. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=653.48s)]
*  So most others, they aim to operate close to where others have been before because it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=659.48s)]
*  perceived as lower risk. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=665.4s)]
*  We actually think about it slightly differently because we make a strong distinction between [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=668.62s)]
*  risk and uncertainty. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=675.08s)]
*  So when you go into a new field, which is far out from when anyone else has been before, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=678.24s)]
*  we can take the example of Altona, which is the world's first tRNA platform. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=683.84s)]
*  Others thought about tRNA as a worker bee in the cell. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  We thought about it as the most critical molecule because it actually connects the mRNA to the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=693.88s)]
*  protein. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=703.84s)]
*  So if there is no tRNA, there will just never be a protein. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=704.84s)]
*  So that means it should be important, right? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  But it's also when you start off on a new venture like that, you have it's oftentimes [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=711.04s)]
*  perceived as high risk. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=716.12s)]
*  But what it really is, it's that it's high uncertainty because you know so little about [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=717.92s)]
*  it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=723.12s)]
*  And in our process, we focus very much on decreasing that uncertainty. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=724.12s)]
*  So very early on, we define for ourselves what are the key critical questions that we [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=729.88s)]
*  need to answer to ourselves to actually understand if this is a viable hypothesis and rapidly [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=734.88s)]
*  focus on those sort of killer questions, if we put it that way. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=743.2s)]
*  And if we at the end of that endeavor can answer to ourselves that, yes, this is actually [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=747.6s)]
*  possible and we can go out to key opinion leaders and ask them, does this seem to be [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=753.64s)]
*  making sense based on everything you know in this field? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=758.56s)]
*  And they say, yeah, it's just that no one has thought about it before. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=761.08s)]
*  That is sort of the best answer to us. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=764.2s)]
*  And what happens then, if we think about it, is that we have ourselves decrease the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=766.2800000000001s)]
*  uncertainty because we have learned so many new things. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=771.32s)]
*  And now we can actually define a risk. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=776.12s)]
*  What was and we can make a decision whether this is something that we actually do want to [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=780.32s)]
*  pursue or not. And I think that is a very unique way of thinking about the friendship [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=785.32s)]
*  between uncertainty and risk that I think is very much core to the process that we [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=791.2s)]
*  have at Flagship that allows us to constantly create new companies over and over again [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=797.1600000000001s)]
*  by being super creative, having wonderful people, super smart people working together [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=804.36s)]
*  on the problems, but also maintaining and sticking to a process throughout that very [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=810.08s)]
*  creative process. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=817.76s)]
*  Where are you finding the founding teams here? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=819.8s)]
*  When you say you're building these companies, you're building them yourself. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=822.52s)]
*  Are you recruiting them in? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=826.16s)]
*  Are you recruiting them from different areas? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=827.4s)]
*  Are you taking people who've already got an established platform and just bringing them [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  under your wing? Can you tell me where do they come in? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=833.28s)]
*  So that's a great question because it's actually probably different from what most people [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  would think because we are not necessarily looking for a specific phenotype with a specific [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  background, etc. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=846.64s)]
*  Most of our originators, they have very strong scientific background, but they can come [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=848.36s)]
*  from very different areas of expertise. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=854.16s)]
*  Many have lived in that interface between biology and AI, sometimes with a PhD in both [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=856.76s)]
*  areas. But I think what's most important is that they have a humongous interest for going [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  beyond and exploring new areas. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=872.52s)]
*  So we bring in people that together work on developing these new hypotheses. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=875.04s)]
*  And we do that by brainstorming on what are areas that we would like to focus on in a [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=883.84s)]
*  very unconstrained process. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=892.0s)]
*  We can innovate in any area, which I think is part of our success as well, because if [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=894.96s)]
*  you only do what you had done before or you only do towards a specific goal, you become [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=901.16s)]
*  very limited in what it is that where you're getting companies built in. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  And instead, we really emphasize and encourage everyone to go across boundaries as to what [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=912.48s)]
*  they've done before and more thinking about the problem and that they're looking to solve [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=920.0s)]
*  and see from what different areas and disciplines do you want to bring insights from. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=924.6s)]
*  And oftentimes that is really where we find these unique opportunities, where by applying, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=931.64s)]
*  and let's say a new AI technology to something that was previously an unsolved problem, all [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=938.84s)]
*  by sudden the biology and AI works together and you can uncover something new. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=945.48s)]
*  I mean, one good example of that is Prologue, which is our company that is thinking about [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  the viral proteome. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=959.5999999999999s)]
*  So this was actually during the course of the pandemic, we looked at viruses and we're [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=961.4s)]
*  like, viruses are bad. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  But what if we think about them in a different way? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=967.04s)]
*  What if we can think about what they actually could do to our benefit? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=969.52s)]
*  And at the same time, AlphaFold came out and all by sudden every sequence, all by [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=974.76s)]
*  sudden was a structure. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=980.12s)]
*  And we said, there must be something in between here. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=981.96s)]
*  And we sort of said we also thought about that viruses, they have hijacked human proteins [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=985.0s)]
*  over a long period of time and then continue to evolve them. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=992.12s)]
*  So that evolutionary pressure allows the system to be exposed to viral variants, millions [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=996.8s)]
*  and millions of viral variants over time and select for by the evolutionary pressure, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1003.52s)]
*  those that have the biggest impact of the human biology. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1009.24s)]
*  And we asked ourselves, what if we could use these ones as therapeutics, because they have [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1014.52s)]
*  been evolutionary optimized over millions and millions of years. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1018.48s)]
*  But then why has no one thought about that before? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1022.36s)]
*  Why hasn't anyone done it before? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1024.76s)]
*  Well, it's because there are like seven million different viral protein sequences out [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1026.24s)]
*  there in the literature and in databases, but there is no functional annotation of them. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1034.04s)]
*  So it's like a big lake of just strings of sequences that no one knows what they mean. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1039.72s)]
*  So then we said, OK, now with AlphaFold, all by sudden every sequence is a structure. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1045.76s)]
*  That's not going to be enough to sort of identify which one are useful for as therapeutics. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1050.44s)]
*  But at least it is a starting point. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1056.12s)]
*  So what if we build a platform, build an engine that allows us to actually annotate [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1058.0s)]
*  sub structures based on sequences that may have certain biological properties? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1065.56s)]
*  And that was sort of the starting point of Prologue. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1071.76s)]
*  And then now we have an engine that allows us to really extract in proteins out of that [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  massive sort of sequence space that have turned out to be very, very powerful therapeutics [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1082.8s)]
*  in the human setting when we test them pre-clinically. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1089.76s)]
*  You mentioned your Fund 7 and Fund 8. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1093.4s)]
*  I mean, these are a billion dollar funds. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1095.84s)]
*  And then you talk about Prologue and how Prologue just came about basically as this idea of, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1098.76s)]
*  well, what if we did this? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1102.96s)]
*  Where are you deploying all this money in the startup creation phase? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1105.68s)]
*  I mean, is it so much in ideation? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1110.56s)]
*  Is there so much for bringing on a team? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1112.68s)]
*  Where are you actually deploying the money? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1115.3200000000002s)]
*  And is it more at the start or are you keeping some behind later for growth? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1117.0s)]
*  I mean, we are very much long term investors. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1123.04s)]
*  These are we are not investors. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1125.0800000000002s)]
*  These are really, you know, we are the founders. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1126.48s)]
*  We are very close to these companies throughout the lifetime of the companies. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  So we start off being off by being the sole investors in the companies. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  We start off with running explorations within sort of flagship where we get to the point of, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1139.32s)]
*  as I mentioned before, this key question as to what is it that we really need to show to [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  ourselves for this to be an idea. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1150.4399999999998s)]
*  And then we put a couple of million dollars towards the certain hypothesis that we have in mind [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1153.1599999999999s)]
*  to test it experimentally, computationally, to generate the data that gives us reason to believe [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1159.84s)]
*  that this is actually a viable path forward. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1166.28s)]
*  And then when we have done that, we and we convinced ourselves and others around us say that, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1170.44s)]
*  you know, that seems really exciting. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1178.92s)]
*  It's just that no one's done it before. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1181.12s)]
*  We create new codes and that we put in maybe 20, 30, 50 million dollars and what others [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1183.12s)]
*  oftentimes call the series A. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1191.92s)]
*  And we build out the platforms and we build out sort of the teams and really start thinking [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1194.8400000000001s)]
*  deeply about value creation and what does the pipeline need to look like in order for this to [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1204.16s)]
*  be a viable company. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1209.4s)]
*  And throughout this process, flagship are the sole investors. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1210.88s)]
*  So we take all this early risk, but also the possibility of really thinking deeply about the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1214.3600000000001s)]
*  science ourselves and go where we believe that we have the biggest opportunity. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1221.48s)]
*  And then at about series B, that's the first time. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1227.16s)]
*  First of all, we bring in an external CEO. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1230.0s)]
*  So I stay on as a CEO until about this time. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1232.96s)]
*  Together, we build the story, but we also bring in an external CEO that have the experience of [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1236.2s)]
*  and really have scaled companies in the past or have built companies to be the biggest [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1243.24s)]
*  versions of themselves. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1249.04s)]
*  And together, we go out and raise the series B. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1251.48s)]
*  And this is the first time we bring in external capital. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1253.16s)]
*  Then we continue to invest in all the coming cycles as well, and oftentimes all the way to the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1257.88s)]
*  IPO and beyond. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1263.96s)]
*  You're in the US, but you're expanding now into the UK and Europe. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1266.64s)]
*  Is this a big step for flagship or is it an inevitable step? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1272.84s)]
*  So it's a good question. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1278.1200000000001s)]
*  And to me personally, I think it's an inevitable step. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  We are global citizens and we should science is global. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1282.88s)]
*  And I think that we really want to be a global organization. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1287.28s)]
*  And it is at the same time a big step because it's not easy to just sort of recreate yourself in [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1292.8s)]
*  different areas. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1301.92s)]
*  But with the right passion for actually doing so and seeing the true benefits of the global [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1303.44s)]
*  footprint, I think we're in a very, very good position to actually do so. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1309.96s)]
*  You mentioned a couple of companies along the way there, and I mean, these are companies that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1315.52s)]
*  people are really starting to hear about the Alterner, but also, I mean, Moderna is a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  flagship company as well. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1325.0800000000002s)]
*  What makes you so much better at identifying these disruptive, really disruptive companies [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  versus a traditional VC model? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1334.12s)]
*  I think it's the repeatedness and the programmability in what we're doing, that we always [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1338.52s)]
*  stick to the same process and we have very skilled teams that are trained in how to think [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1342.84s)]
*  differently, really trained in how to be unbiased and really go after, go after, as I [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1351.32s)]
*  mentioned before, those non adjacencies. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1360.72s)]
*  We are not looking to do same as others. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1362.8s)]
*  We are looking to unlock very different areas because that gives us also freedom to then [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1365.96s)]
*  continue to evolve because this is very much white space that no one else is. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1372.28s)]
*  And I mean, experience is always important. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1377.92s)]
*  Flagship's been around since 2000. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1380.04s)]
*  All in all, a hundred different companies have been founded. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1382.28s)]
*  And right now we have about 40 companies that we're working closely with. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1386.44s)]
*  And it is a lot about being in an environment where the impossible seems possible because [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1391.68s)]
*  everyone around you are also doing it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1403.12s)]
*  And I think just from a mental model perspective, it's just so much easier to be in an [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1405.36s)]
*  environment where everyone are starting companies. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1412.32s)]
*  Your threshold for actually doing it yourself goes down because you always have someone [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1416.44s)]
*  to ask, how did you even think about when you got into that challenge or whatever? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1421.88s)]
*  Because we are all going through the same phases, basically, with all of our different [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1427.2s)]
*  companies, but just at different timescales. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1431.84s)]
*  So that is an institutional learning, which I think is core to our ability to actually [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1434.76s)]
*  do this over and over and over again. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1442.08s)]
*  And I would say get better at it in every iteration because we iterate all the time [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1444.36s)]
*  and we try to learn, apply, learn, apply, learn, apply. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1449.28s)]
*  And that, I think, is the reason for why we can do this successfully. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1452.52s)]
*  Having that model or that really that program of we know what works, we can keep [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1458.72s)]
*  iterating and improving it, but we have a model of how to start a company, get it up, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1463.92s)]
*  get it running and get it to a point where we can raise some more money and bring in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1468.3200000000002s)]
*  some outside investors eventually. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1472.3600000000001s)]
*  That's great to have that model. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1474.2s)]
*  You know, imagine I'm convinced. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1475.8000000000002s)]
*  Why isn't everybody else doing it this way? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1477.52s)]
*  Is there is there something holding them back? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1479.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot of hard work. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1483.4s)]
*  There is no question about it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1484.76s)]
*  And you have to have a lot of good ideas. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1486.0s)]
*  And you need to also you need to create that ecosystem and it's not built overnight. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1487.68s)]
*  And you take all the early risk yourself. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1494.4s)]
*  But at the same time, if you're convinced and you're committed to it, it is to be in [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1497.28s)]
*  a good position. But there are easier ways of doing things. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1501.48s)]
*  You can find easier jobs and just, you know, go to work at eight to five. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1505.92s)]
*  I think we live our companies and we love what we do. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1510.64s)]
*  And I think that passion is what brings people together to actually want to do it in [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1513.16s)]
*  these types of setting. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1517.16s)]
*  But but it's a lot of experience within these walls. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1519.76s)]
*  And I think just gathering that experience in one and the same place, that is a. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1523.52s)]
*  That that's not so easy. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1531.0s)]
*  And that takes time to build. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1533.6s)]
*  Can you generating these ideas, generating these killer questions that allow you to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1536.8s)]
*  to just think differently about an area and ask the what ifs that other people aren't. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1542.08s)]
*  How do you go about building a culture where people can come up with ideas like that and [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1547.04s)]
*  ask those sorts of questions? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1551.68s)]
*  You know, that's very interesting to reflect over. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1553.52s)]
*  And coming back a little bit to your points as to Big Pharma and the differences being [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1556.52s)]
*  in different environments. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1561.32s)]
*  And and I would say when I reflect back over some of the biggest differences with regards [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1562.92s)]
*  to Big Pharma, maybe and where I am now is that, you know, if you say no to given the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1568.48s)]
*  the sort of risk in biotek and sort of the failure rate, I mean, that's the sort of the [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1577.16s)]
*  that we see from the very early inception to something coming on the market. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1583.3200000000002s)]
*  You will always have the highest probability of being right if you say no. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1587.96s)]
*  That's a given. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1592.28s)]
*  And oftentimes it is a safe position to say no. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1593.72s)]
*  That's not possible. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1597.96s)]
*  That's not going to work. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1598.76s)]
*  You know, going to be right many times. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1600.2s)]
*  I think what we really create here is a culture where you say yes and. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1602.44s)]
*  So what's very, very important is that when there are new ideas coming up, no matter how [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1607.64s)]
*  crazy they may sound at first, what you still want to do is that you want to say you need [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1612.68s)]
*  to really have the mental model of that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1619.88s)]
*  You're saying yes. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1622.28s)]
*  And because that is how you start to unlock and bring that from a super crazy idea to [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1623.24s)]
*  something that you actually. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1629.5600000000002s)]
*  OK, if you think about 100 different ways how we could make the impossible possible, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1630.76s)]
*  you will find something that may not be completely crazy. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1636.44s)]
*  And then you spin off from there. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1640.52s)]
*  So I think it's it's building that culture that you never sort of. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  That you don't just kill ideas instead, you sort of OK, there is a first this person and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1649.96s)]
*  bringing this forward. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1655.48s)]
*  There is something behind it. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1656.2s)]
*  How can I build on that? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1657.48s)]
*  And I think that is super important for being a creative culture and innovative culture as [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1658.8400000000001s)]
*  we are here. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1663.72s)]
*  Some of the companies that have spun out of flagship have gone on to do amazing things, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1664.3s)]
*  and almost everybody would have heard about Moderna because of what happened through COVID [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1670.06s)]
*  and the fantastic innovations there, and they're still there today. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1674.54s)]
*  But then there are some other companies that, like a lot of biotech companies, just struggled [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1677.98s)]
*  to find a market fit. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1682.14s)]
*  How do you balance the risk of of most companies not making it with the possibility that they [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1684.8600000000001s)]
*  could be a shooting star? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1694.22s)]
*  I mean, it is it's a good question, and I would say that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1698.06s)]
*  It is about always building out scenarios for yourself, because we know that you will [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  oftentimes and imagine different realities for the future. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1713.1799999999998s)]
*  And I think that is very integral to our process and I think very, very important. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1718.62s)]
*  And when I say because we will all of us will and that's what that's the entire biotech [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1723.8999999999999s)]
*  and that's the entire sort of science field is that you will find challenges many, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1729.82s)]
*  many times. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1735.5s)]
*  It's part of the excitement. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1736.2199999999998s)]
*  There was a part of the hard work that the science is not it's not figured out. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1737.4199999999998s)]
*  So you have to figure it out as you as you go along. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1741.58s)]
*  But what we focus a lot of time on is to building out different scenarios. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1746.3s)]
*  And when I say building out different scenarios, I don't just mean that we put like four [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1750.54s)]
*  different, you know, place on a piece of paper, like we could be here or there or there. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1754.4599999999998s)]
*  I really mean building out the entire scenario. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1761.6599999999999s)]
*  We can make the analogy with building houses. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1765.26s)]
*  So there is one thing to say you're going to build it in three different geographies. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1768.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a completely different thing to say if I build it here. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1771.5s)]
*  And I put this type of house and I put the sofa in that what view will I have from there. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1775.26s)]
*  And if I do that level of granularity in my scenario planning for all the different houses [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1780.3s)]
*  that you're planning for, you can much more be much more informed as to seeing what is [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1786.1399999999999s)]
*  the value creation or what is the view that I would see from each of these different windows. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1791.8999999999999s)]
*  And then if you hit a hurdle, you have already thought through all the way what other [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1797.26s)]
*  optionalities could be for you. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1804.3s)]
*  And then it's much easier to rapidly pivot into another way of thinking about it because [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1806.3s)]
*  you've already done the mental work of putting yourself in what that alternative future could [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1812.3799999999999s)]
*  potentially be looking for. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1819.1s)]
*  And for me, that is a framework that is really helpful because oftentimes it's the mental [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1820.86s)]
*  models that block you from finding that next. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1826.46s)]
*  And if you already spend time thinking about it, you're just much more agile in jumping [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1829.34s)]
*  to the next and a different future. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1835.82s)]
*  There are at least a couple of flagship companies that come to mind when we think about [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1839.4199999999998s)]
*  AI and biology really making that mix a priority metaphor biotechnologies as well. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1844.78s)]
*  They both have approaches where AI is just fundamental to the value that's being created [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1851.4199999999998s)]
*  there. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1856.22s)]
*  From your perspective or from flagship's perspective, how important is AI to biology [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1857.42s)]
*  now? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1863.02s)]
*  And is it likely just to become more and more important? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1863.26s)]
*  So I would say AI is core to everything we do today. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1867.74s)]
*  And it will just, I think, become even more important for the future. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1872.3s)]
*  And I think it just opens up avenues that we just never seen before. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1877.18s)]
*  At the same time, one has to be, you know, take it that's stepwise as to never losing [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1881.9s)]
*  track of what it is that you're actually applying AI towards and why. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1889.02s)]
*  And be learn because there's so much we still don't know about how we shall be applying [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1893.3400000000001s)]
*  AI. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1902.14s)]
*  And I think good example you brought up a priori and metaphor. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1902.6200000000001s)]
*  I think those are great examples of where AI can really, really puts us in a completely [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1905.6599999999999s)]
*  different future from where we were before. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1911.5s)]
*  And let me take the example of, for example, metaphor. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1915.58s)]
*  Because metaphor is generative biology in the sense that we design novel therapeutics [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1918.9399999999998s)]
*  with functional attributes. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1925.8999999999999s)]
*  And I don't know, there was a paper in science not too long ago around Alpha Fold. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1928.6999999999998s)]
*  And how it was basically saying Alpha Fold is running out of data. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1935.02s)]
*  And what the authors made the claim that it was just a lack of data. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1940.1399999999999s)]
*  And that there was collaborations now being put in place between different parties to [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1945.98s)]
*  actually feed the algorithms with more data. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1950.3799999999999s)]
*  And that was sort of help solve the challenges with Alpha Fold. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1953.18s)]
*  And I think, I mean, there is more data is oftentimes a very important piece. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1958.7s)]
*  And it makes models better, etc. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1965.42s)]
*  But it's not just about more data. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1968.7s)]
*  It's also about the right types of data. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1972.14s)]
*  And I think in particular when it comes to generative modeling, that is essential. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1975.0200000000002s)]
*  Because if you think about crystal structure data, which almost every single company [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1980.14s)]
*  that are doing AI design of therapeutic start off from, I mean, a crystal structure is [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1984.22s)]
*  something super static. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1990.22s)]
*  It is also maybe taken out of the membrane, a lot of truncations in order to be able to [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1991.42s)]
*  crystallize it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1997.5s)]
*  And then you look at it in the cryo state. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=1998.38s)]
*  So it's very static. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2001.18s)]
*  And we all know that biology is not static. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2002.8600000000001s)]
*  Biology is a lot of dynamics. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2005.66s)]
*  It's different binding partners coming in and bringing different aspects of our binding [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2008.3s)]
*  partners together. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2013.1000000000001s)]
*  You get confirmation of changes and then you get differences in the downstream signaling. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2014.22s)]
*  And only if you capture that types of data and that type of data, can you actually train [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2019.8999999999999s)]
*  your models to design for it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2028.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2030.7s)]
*  So that's what we've been focusing on at Metaphor to really generate living cell data on how [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2031.5s)]
*  binding results in function. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2040.3s)]
*  So how does a molecule engage with the target? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2043.82s)]
*  And how does it then affect downstream signaling? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2048.46s)]
*  And we can in this system with deep mutation scanning, we actually experimentally generate [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2053.5s)]
*  100 billions of data points. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2060.7s)]
*  And we use that to train our models. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2062.54s)]
*  And that has allowed us to very rapidly in less than a year, we actually generated five [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2064.54s)]
*  agonistic antibodies, many of them to a GPCRs. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2072.38s)]
*  And there are no agonistic antibodies on the market. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2076.14s)]
*  So I think this is one example where by having the right types of data and then we can use all [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2079.1s)]
*  the other tools that everyone else is using as well, we can unlock novel biology that has just [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2084.06s)]
*  not been programmable before. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2090.14s)]
*  And I think agonistic antibodies is one of these areas. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2091.74s)]
*  It has not been programmable before. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2094.54s)]
*  It has been serendipity that has driven that because the information that goes into other [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2096.7s)]
*  AI models does not capture it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2103.66s)]
*  And then you don't have that information. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2106.22s)]
*  So I think it's a lot about also thinking about the amounts of data and the types of data [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2107.8199999999997s)]
*  in order to explain. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2114.22s)]
*  And the models will never be better than the data they are built from. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2115.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2118.22s)]
*  You know, it's sometimes pretty easy to learn lessons from businesses that succeed and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2119.66s)]
*  entrepreneurs that succeed. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2125.82s)]
*  It's being able to learn the lessons from the ones that don't succeed and unpacking why [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2127.34s)]
*  that happened that can lead to real growth and iteration on a business model. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2132.54s)]
*  Can you think of a time, maybe a business that flagship invested in and it just didn't work, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2137.26s)]
*  but you learned something from that process that you're able to apply the next time, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2143.7400000000002s)]
*  the next round, the next company? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2148.1400000000003s)]
*  So I would say that we learn those lessons every day. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2151.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2155.1000000000004s)]
*  In every company, there are things that we test that work out and there are things that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2156.46s)]
*  we test that do not work out. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2160.7s)]
*  And we try to have a very sort of iterative process for our learning and for our evolution [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2162.3s)]
*  so that we learn from every day's mistake and apply it into our next iteration of learning. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2167.9s)]
*  And I can only agree with you. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2174.06s)]
*  That is immensely important. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2175.42s)]
*  It's always hard to make explicit examples because there could be so many. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2178.46s)]
*  It takes a lot of time to really dig into every example that you have. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2183.34s)]
*  I have a bank of different examples, absolutely, that I constantly draw from. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2189.5s)]
*  But I think it's more about putting that process and having that hat on all the time, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2195.42s)]
*  where you learn from how does this pan out across when you have seen something before, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2202.2200000000003s)]
*  what are the different settings that you've seen it in? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2210.46s)]
*  How did it pan out? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2213.1s)]
*  And why did it pan out in a different way in one over the other? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2214.38s)]
*  And just constantly bring that up in your decision making for that next round as well. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2218.22s)]
*  But use it as satellite points, because every situation is always so different. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2225.34s)]
*  So you also need to make sure that you constantly sort of bring the right reference frame to the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2230.94s)]
*  problem that you're at. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2236.94s)]
*  But I couldn't agree more. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2238.7s)]
*  It's a super important aspect of how we can evolve successfully as companies. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2240.2999999999997s)]
*  So looking forward, what's the future now for Flagship? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2247.8199999999997s)]
*  Are there companies that we're going to be hearing about in the next few months? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2252.22s)]
*  What does it look like in the next 12 to 18 months for Flagship? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2255.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, I think it's a very exciting time ahead. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2260.14s)]
*  You mentioned one of the areas that we're super passionate about, AI biology. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2264.3799999999997s)]
*  How do we really make AI come to life? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2268.7s)]
*  I think metaphor and a priori are two components you brought forward with regards to [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2272.2999999999997s)]
*  how we can use this very, very experimentally detailed information [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2277.98s)]
*  to be able to solve big problems. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2281.8199999999997s)]
*  How can we build very resilient vaccines? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2283.66s)]
*  I think that's a very sort of valid question today. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2287.58s)]
*  So how do we make sure that vaccines that are actually these therapeutic or prophylactic [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2290.46s)]
*  that have saved the most lives in humanity, how do we ensure that we bring new such technology [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2296.14s)]
*  to the market because we need it as humanity? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2302.06s)]
*  I'm super excited about metaphor, obviously, as we are unlocking a complete new class [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2306.62s)]
*  of antibodies, agonistic antibodies. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2313.3399999999997s)]
*  And 80% of biology is through signaling. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2315.9s)]
*  It's not through blocking, which every antagonistic antibody does. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  So we are like tapping into that 80% of totality of biology that has not really been accessible before. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2325.1s)]
*  That's super exciting. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2331.9s)]
*  I couldn't be more proud of the ALTERNA team that is now bringing tRNA for the first time into clinic. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2333.5s)]
*  The ability to go after rare genetic diseases as baskets. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2340.7799999999997s)]
*  So how can we use a single molecule to treat hundreds or thousands of different rare genetic diseases? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2347.1s)]
*  Those are the kind of things that we can go from where rare diseases can be treated like common diseases [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2353.18s)]
*  and imagine the kind of unmet need that you can meet with such a medicine [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2359.02s)]
*  because that is not the world where we will have regulatory approvals for thousands of different rare diseases. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2365.66s)]
*  It will be another hundred years before that actually happens. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2371.1s)]
*  So I think that's some of, for me, the exciting areas ahead that where I think we have [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2374.14s)]
*  really, you know, we see the unmet need. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2382.94s)]
*  We see the patient groups that will benefit tremendously from this. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2386.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think that is the strongest motivator one can have. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2390.46s)]
*  You know, in preparing to talk to you today, I looked at some of the other talks that you've given [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2396.2200000000003s)]
*  and some of the things you've written. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2400.94s)]
*  One thing that jumped out was you spoke about the importance of diversity of mindset [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2401.98s)]
*  and multidisciplinary teams in attacking some of these problems. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2407.26s)]
*  Is that something we should look for a flagship to continue to foster as you move forward? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2411.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2417.42s)]
*  And I think diversity is such an important piece of what we're doing [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2418.46s)]
*  because being creative and having input that is different from every single person around the table [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2424.86s)]
*  is critical for doing what we're doing. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2431.34s)]
*  And by bringing people from different backgrounds, from different cultures, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2434.38s)]
*  those that, you know, in every aspect of diversity, I think that is that where we have such an edge [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2439.18s)]
*  because we are a very sort of diverse organization as such. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2445.98s)]
*  And for me, it's immensely important, equally important that you need to have people that speak [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2449.2599999999998s)]
*  both languages when it comes to biology and machine learning. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2455.58s)]
*  Equally important it is that we have strong female leaders, strong culture differences on the team. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2459.1s)]
*  I mean, whatever it is when it comes to diversity, we should always strive for having as [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2467.7400000000002s)]
*  many differences or diversities around the table because the product, I think, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2475.26s)]
*  really becomes a much better product in the end. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2481.26s)]
*  And it's also more fun to have many different flavors of life around you. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2484.94s)]
*  Finally, Lovisa, I guess what would be the legacy that you're hoping to leave with your work in [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2495.58s)]
*  flagship? Is it just founding these companies? Is it exploring new ideas? Is it something else? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2501.58s)]
*  I mean, for me, it is imagine, you know, unlocking a just [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2507.9s)]
*  unmet patient need and seeing how, let's say, let's take these rare genetic disease patients. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2514.7s)]
*  There are so many, there is such a great unmet need in that area, for example. Imagine bringing [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2524.62s)]
*  a therapy that can be used across thousands of different diseases that otherwise would get no [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2531.98s)]
*  attention. I mean, that I think would be such a legacy to be able to do. And I think more generally, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2538.2999999999997s)]
*  what motivates me is that you can really, you have a lot of ability to steer where you're going. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2546.7799999999997s)]
*  And really focus on what really matters. And that's a very unique position to be in and [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  something one should worship and take care of because it's a great opportunity to leave a [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2561.58s)]
*  footprint after. Lovisa, thanks for joining us today on Beyond Biotech. Thank you so much, Dylan. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02YIDXj11o&t=2570.8599999999997s)]
