# New class of small molecule therapeutics introduced
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech Podcast number 73. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly LeBioTek podcast and this week we're talking about [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=13.08s)]
*  Molecular Gates, which is a new class of small molecule that eliminates disease causing extracellular [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=18.72s)]
*  proteins. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=25.8s)]
*  The new small molecule class is the basis of a company that recently exited stealth, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=26.92s)]
*  Gate Bioscience. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=33.04s)]
*  To give us the details on the company and Molecular Gates is Jordy Matafink, co-founder [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  and chief executive officer at Gate Bioscience. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=40.68s)]
*  Gate Bioscience is a biotechnology company, preclinical biotechnology company, developing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=45.52s)]
*  a new class of medicines that we call Molecular Gates. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=51.46s)]
*  Molecular Gates are small molecules to selectively eliminate disease causing extracellular proteins [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=55.32s)]
*  and they do so by attacking those proteins at their source inside the cell. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=62.36s)]
*  I wonder if you could tell me about disease causing extracellular proteins, what they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=66.76s)]
*  are and how that causes issues. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=72.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely Jim. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  So, extracellular proteins are proteins that act outside the cell. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=76.64s)]
*  So this means either they are secreted from the cell or sitting on the cell membrane but [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=82.16s)]
*  facing outwards. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=87.36s)]
*  You know, out of the 20,000 proteins that are encoded in the human genome, about 4,000 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=88.36s)]
*  of those are extracellular proteins and about 1,000 of those are linked to disease. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  So the types of diseases that are caused by extracellular proteins include diseases where, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=101.22s)]
*  for example, the extracellular protein is produced at too high a level or it's produced [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  at the wrong time or at the wrong place in the body or in some instances where the protein [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=111.16s)]
*  is produced and then it misfolds and it aggregates and that can cause problems. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  So there's a whole range of extracellular proteins that cause disease in different manifestations [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=120.96s)]
*  and we can get into some of the specifics of those if you like. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=126.6s)]
*  That will be interesting because obviously this isn't something that's new and it's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=129.68s)]
*  something that's just been discovered. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  What traditionally have been some of those issues and the ways that have been treated? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=136.6s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=142.4s)]
*  So let's take, for example, a very common class of extracellular proteins that cause [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=143.4s)]
*  disease in diseases of inflammation, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=147.12s)]
*  So when you have an inflammatory reaction to say a bacterial infection, one of the first [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=150.2s)]
*  things that happens is your immune cells secrete very large quantities of inflammatory proteins [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=155.2s)]
*  called cytokines. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=161.06s)]
*  So this happens as part of a natural immune protective response to an infection, but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=162.58s)]
*  it can also happen in the context of autoimmune disease. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=166.94000000000003s)]
*  So in something like rheumatoid arthritis, for example, you have an auto reaction in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  your joints and you have immune cells secreting large amounts of inflammatory proteins in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=173.74s)]
*  a place when they're not supposed to and at a time when they're not supposed to, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  So you could consider, for example, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory autoimmune [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=181.62s)]
*  diseases as diseases that are really driven by extracellular proteins. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=185.78s)]
*  And if you think about the therapeutic landscape for these types of diseases, in some instances, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=191.14s)]
*  they're actually reasonably well treated with biologic drugs like antibodies that can come [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=195.77999999999997s)]
*  in and bind to and eliminate the extracellular protein. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=200.32s)]
*  What we often know in these contexts is that when you have a disease that is driven clearly [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  by one pathogenic protein, what you want to do is get rid of that protein. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  So the roots of eliminating that protein today therapeutically tend to be things like antibodies, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=212.44s)]
*  drugs that you would inject and would come in and bind to the protein and eliminate it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=217.74s)]
*  or other classes of drugs, also biologics, like nucleic acid drugs, say things like siRNA [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=222.78s)]
*  or antisense oligos that you might inject and they would block the translation of those [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=228.62s)]
*  proteins, so the production of those proteins from inside the cell. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=233.9s)]
*  And so that's sort of the therapeutic arsenal that we have today for eliminating extracellular [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=237.36s)]
*  proteins are these classes of biologic drugs. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=241.34s)]
*  They work quite well in some instances, but they do have their drawbacks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=244.58s)]
*  So one of those drawbacks is that biologic drugs have to be injected. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=248.08s)]
*  And so as a patient who might be suffering from one of these conditions, having to take [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=253.0s)]
*  an injectable medication as opposed to a pill that can be taken orally is inconvenient and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  at times can actually cause a barrier to access to the therapy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  And then there are other instances where, for example, the extracellular protein might [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  be produced in a tissue, say in the brain, where biologic drugs have a really hard time [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=268.94s)]
*  accessing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=274.24s)]
*  And so even injecting the drugs as they're done conventionally really does not allow [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  them to get into the brain. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=279.66s)]
*  So there are unmet needs for diseases of extracellular proteins. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=281.56s)]
*  Are there some that haven't even been tackled at all because of that issue? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=285.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=289.2s)]
*  So you can think of it as a spectrum from things like the example we just spoke about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=290.2s)]
*  inflammatory cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory diseases that are very [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=295.22s)]
*  well treated today with antibodies all the way to another end of a spectrum of proteins [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=300.62s)]
*  that we know are pathogenic, but perhaps because they're expressed in the brain or because [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=305.86s)]
*  oftentimes proteins that aggregate actually fall into this category, they get made by [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  the cell and then they misfold and clump together. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=314.86s)]
*  And then those clumps deposit in tissues and cause problems. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=317.54s)]
*  Once those clumps form, it is darn near impossible to get rid of them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=320.86s)]
*  So for example, Alzheimer's might be a great classic example of this, although there are [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=325.0s)]
*  many others of diseases where there's a protein that misfolds and aggregates and trying to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=328.82s)]
*  get rid of that aggregate after the fact is both very difficult and it may be too late, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=333.94s)]
*  depending on how much damage has been done. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=339.46s)]
*  And so there's a real need to perhaps come in and intervene early before the protein [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=341.62s)]
*  is even produced. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=345.74s)]
*  And I guess as you were saying, there's also different kinds of extracellular proteins [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  or different issues that are being caused. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=352.58s)]
*  So it's not just the spectrum of difficulty, it's the different ways in which these can [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=355.38s)]
*  become issues. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=360.82s)]
*  You know, this is going to get us into a really fascinating topic, which is what we do as [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=361.82s)]
*  a company and our drug modality that we call molecular gates. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=366.38s)]
*  And so perhaps this is jumping the gun on some other questions that we're going to cover, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=370.4s)]
*  but you're exactly right, Jim, that there are of these thousand extracellular proteins [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=374.34s)]
*  that can cause disease, they cause diseases in different ways. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=378.54s)]
*  Sometimes it's because they're expressed too high. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=382.22s)]
*  Sometimes they're misfolding. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes they're just signaling in a place that they're not supposed to be signaling. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  As we will talk about, the way that molecular gates work is to try and eliminate these extracellular [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=389.26000000000005s)]
*  proteins at their source inside the cell while they're being made. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=395.3s)]
*  And when we put our gate goggles on and look at the process by which these proteins are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=400.22s)]
*  being made and secreted by the cell, they're all made and secreted through a common pathway. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=405.36s)]
*  And so even though these thousand different types of disease causing extracellular proteins [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=410.7s)]
*  are all different in their own ways at their source, they're actually very similar. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  And so there's a common mechanism that we hope to go after in drug with our molecular [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=420.34s)]
*  gate drug modality. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=424.42s)]
*  Is that why the company was created in order to be able to address those unmet needs? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=425.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=430.9s)]
*  We looked at the world. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=432.02s)]
*  We said, if you could eliminate extracellular proteins, that's clearly an unmet need and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=433.02s)]
*  to do so selectively with small molecules. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=437.38s)]
*  As we just said, there's some instances where this would be a better therapeutic option [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=440.02s)]
*  for patients that currently take injectable biologics. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  And in other cases where we might be able to intervene in diseases that today have no [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=446.85999999999996s)]
*  therapies. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's really motivating for those of us in biotech, as you know. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  And the insight that we had was that it might be possible to selectively eliminate extracellular [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=456.02s)]
*  proteins by addressing them at their source inside the cell. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=462.68s)]
*  So the fundamental biology here, maybe we could walk through it for a few minutes. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=467.28s)]
*  If we open up our high school and college biology textbooks, we have DNA goes to RNA, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=471.7s)]
*  goes to protein is the central dogma. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=476.67999999999995s)]
*  For proteins that need to be extracellular, they're all getting made inside the cell as [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=479.14s)]
*  all proteins are. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=484.52s)]
*  So they have to cross a membrane to get from inside the cell to outside the cell. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=485.52s)]
*  It's a pathway that's called the secretory pathway. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=489.58s)]
*  And what's interesting is that the proteins as they're being translated by the ribosome [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  off of the mRNA, they all go through a single channel, common conserved channel that's called [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=496.14000000000004s)]
*  the secretory translocon. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  It sits in the endoplasmic reticulum. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=503.7s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of biology words right now. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=505.18s)]
*  But so there's a common channel in the ER called the secretory translocon. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  And all 4,000 secreted and membrane proteins have to go through this channel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=510.90000000000003s)]
*  So there's a common, think of it as a common bottleneck or a common entryway into the secretory [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=516.4200000000001s)]
*  pathway. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  The insight that we had was that it would be possible to put a drug in this channel, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=521.9s)]
*  to drug the secretory translocon, and to selectively stop a disease-causing protein from going [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  through the channel while allowing other proteins to pass through normally and to be secreted [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=533.04s)]
*  normally. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=537.42s)]
*  So what happens in this context just is if we imagine ourselves riding alongside a protein [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=538.42s)]
*  that's being secreted, as the protein is made, it goes through the channel. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=543.9s)]
*  If the drug is present, the molecular gate is present in the channel. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=547.96s)]
*  And if our protein is a disease-causing protein that the molecular gate has been designed [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=551.58s)]
*  to block, the protein is unable to transit through the channel. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=555.26s)]
*  And instead it gets blocked and basically spills out into the cytoplasm of the cell [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  where it is immediately recognized as being mislocalized and gets chewed up by the cell. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  So the cell has all sorts of pathways in place to get rid of proteins that are unable to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=568.2s)]
*  be secreted. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  And we essentially take the disease-causing protein and shunt it into the degradation [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=574.58s)]
*  pathway as opposed to allowing it to be secreted. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=577.96s)]
*  How do you differentiate between a protein that you want to pass and a protein that you [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=581.22s)]
*  don't? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=585.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=586.96s)]
*  So fundamentally, it's because the amino acid sequence of each of those 4,000 proteins that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=587.96s)]
*  is going through the channel is different. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=593.6s)]
*  Every protein has its own amino acid sequence. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  And our molecule, our molecular gate that's sitting in the channel, can discriminate between [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=599.1400000000001s)]
*  those amino acid sequences and therefore block selectively the ones that we would like to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=603.8199999999999s)]
*  prevent the secretion while allow others through. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  It's actually interesting if we take this as a jumping off point to maybe look back [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=612.38s)]
*  at the history of this pathway and at molecules that can intervene at the secretory translocon [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=616.14s)]
*  at this common channel. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  It's a pretty old, old story. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=624.18s)]
*  So the first discoveries of molecules that bind to and interfere with the secretory translocon [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=626.3399999999999s)]
*  actually goes back nearly 30 years. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=633.24s)]
*  It was the mid 1990s. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=635.0s)]
*  And a couple of different pharma companies, Novartis and others, were doing phenotypic [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=637.32s)]
*  screens, essentially taking fungal broths and bacterial broths and panning them on cell [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  lines to see if they could see any physiological effect that they could then go explore to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=646.88s)]
*  see what was causing it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=651.28s)]
*  And in looking for molecules that were anti-inflammatory, they came across a set of natural products [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  that ultimately, through much biochemical work, they figured out were molecules that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=657.64s)]
*  were blocking the secretory translocon. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=661.32s)]
*  Now, interestingly, in these compounds from the mid 90s, if you imagine that channel where [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=663.6600000000001s)]
*  all the proteins are going through, these molecules were essentially acting as a plug [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=669.0600000000001s)]
*  in that channel. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=672.46s)]
*  They would sit in the channel and they would block all proteins from going through. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=673.46s)]
*  It showed up in the phenotypic screen as anti-inflammatory because, as we talked about a few minutes [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=676.62s)]
*  ago, inflammatory proteins have to get secreted in an abundant quantity through this channel. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=681.86s)]
*  And so it might be the first thing you see missing if you block the channel. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=686.7s)]
*  So that's kind of how they were discovered. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=690.52s)]
*  But fundamentally, these molecules acted as plugs, stopping the transit of nearly everything [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=692.4799999999999s)]
*  through the channel. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  But it did kick off a really fruitful 30 years of chemical biology exploration where industry [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=699.2199999999999s)]
*  scientists and academic scientists around the world took these molecules, made derivatives [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  of them, figured out what they were binding to, figured out where they were binding in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  the secretory translocon, figured out all sorts of biochemical assays, and really understood [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=713.76s)]
*  the process by which these plugs were working. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=719.62s)]
*  Where gait bio comes in is actually an insight that we had my scientific co-founder actually [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=723.14s)]
*  did this work in his academic career, which was to discover that actually, through the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=727.9399999999999s)]
*  magic of medicinal chemistry, you could make molecules that instead of acting as a plug, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=732.86s)]
*  act as a gate, meaning that instead of blocking all things from going through, you could introduce [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=738.5s)]
*  chemical diversity in the molecules binding to the secretory translocon in such a way [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=744.88s)]
*  that you would actually allow many proteins to pass through and only block some of them. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=750.44s)]
*  And then once you saw that there was a difference between the things that were blocked and things [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=755.6s)]
*  that weren't, you could start to design for that selectivity. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  You could start to make changes to the molecules and test them and iteratively drive more potent [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=763.2s)]
*  molecules and more selective molecules. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  It was really that insight that you could move from plugs to gates that got us started [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=771.18s)]
*  with our company. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=775.66s)]
*  How did that initial idea and that concept translate itself into a company? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=776.66s)]
*  Because obviously you've got to have some kind of goal in mind, whether it's a product [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=782.34s)]
*  or what you're going to tackle. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=787.22s)]
*  No, it's a great question. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=788.74s)]
*  I think philosophically, Jim, the way I like to think about this is anytime there's a new [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=790.7s)]
*  scientific innovation, something like this, I mean, it happened dozens of times a year, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=795.6s)]
*  is it worth pursuing? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=801.8s)]
*  It's never easy. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=803.92s)]
*  It's always, you're at some early point and there's a whole lot of work that needs to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=804.92s)]
*  be done. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  And the exercise I like to do is to go imagine the future, disconnect it from what's possible [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=808.6s)]
*  today and go navigate that future landscape, try to map it and see, is it worth going? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=814.04s)]
*  Is there a valuable destination? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  And once you identify that valuable destination, then you can figure out if it's worth putting [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=820.36s)]
*  in the effort to get there from where you are today. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  So the first thing we did, once this concept came across to say, wait, it might be possible [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=827.2199999999999s)]
*  to selectively stop proteins going through the secretory transloca. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=831.6199999999999s)]
*  I said, well, okay, what's the consequence of that? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=836.02s)]
*  The consequence would be selective elimination of extracellular proteins with a small molecule. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=838.66s)]
*  So we started imagining where that might be useful. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=845.54s)]
*  And we get back to the very first question you asked me, where might this be useful? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=847.2199999999999s)]
*  Diseases of inflammation, where today patients have to take injectable drugs and have all [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=850.9399999999999s)]
*  sorts of downsides and inconveniences. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  Diseases of protein aggregation, where there might not be treatments available today. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=857.6s)]
*  Extracellular proteins produced in the brain where biologics struggle to get to. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=862.16s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=866.48s)]
*  There are cancers that are driven by receptors that today are drugged with small molecule [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=867.48s)]
*  inhibitors, but where resistance mutations emerge. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=871.4s)]
*  And so perhaps if you eliminated the protein, the list goes on and on of hypothetical ideas [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=873.68s)]
*  where you say, well, gee, these are important extracellular proteins that we know cause [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=878.24s)]
*  disease. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=882.24s)]
*  And if you could eliminate them with a small molecule, that feels like that would be valuable. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=883.84s)]
*  So once we were convinced that the destination was valuable, then we went back and said, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  great, let's go build this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=891.1600000000001s)]
*  How do we build this? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=892.2800000000001s)]
*  And in the case of GATE, there's a large component of what we do that is a chemistry organization. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  We need to have the best chemists in house and the tools and the insights and all the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=899.6s)]
*  assays that come to bear to make small molecule drugs. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  But also importantly, as we were talking earlier, there are these thousand potential targets [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=908.32s)]
*  we could go after, extracellular proteins we could want to inhibit. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=913.24s)]
*  But when we put our GATE goggles on and we look at the mechanism, we only see one common [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=916.42s)]
*  mechanism. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=920.78s)]
*  We see all of these proteins going through a single channel where our molecules bind [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=921.78s)]
*  and set up a molecular GATE. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=926.74s)]
*  And we realized very early on that this ability to focus on a single molecular event, a single [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=928.48s)]
*  biochemical pathway in the cell, would actually be a real superpower for the company. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=935.96s)]
*  Because what it means is that we can build tools and assays and insights and molecules [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=941.64s)]
*  focused on this channel and the way that the molecular gates are binding to it and how [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=946.8s)]
*  they're interacting. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=950.6s)]
*  And that's a real consolidation of effort. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=952.04s)]
*  We can put a lot of effort into that, and that's going to apply to every program that [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=954.22s)]
*  we do. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=957.76s)]
*  So a way to think about that, because we have this focus on a single pathway and a single [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=958.76s)]
*  mechanism, things like every problem that we solve or every insight that we generate [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=962.04s)]
*  every breakthrough that the team makes on one program immediately applies to every other [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=967.68s)]
*  program we could possibly do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=972.76s)]
*  So we get iteratively faster and smarter and better at making the types of drugs that we're [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=974.16s)]
*  trying to make. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=979.6s)]
*  What clicked for us is why this made sense as a company and how we should build it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=980.76s)]
*  Because there are so many different diseases applications, is it difficult to kind of focus [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=984.64s)]
*  on one or are you able to focus on lots all at the same time? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=991.24s)]
*  Yeah, what a great question. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  There are lots of opportunities for molecular gates, but we as an organization, any organization, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=997.04s)]
*  cannot do all of them at the same time. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1002.28s)]
*  So we do have to focus on a few that we think are most tractable and most interesting for [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1004.1999999999999s)]
*  the company and for the technology today and most meaningful for patients. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1009.04s)]
*  So we do have certain areas of focus, as we've talked about for us today, it's around inflammation [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1012.68s)]
*  and around protein aggregation diseases and the intersection of those with neuroscience. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1017.12s)]
*  So where molecular gates can get into the brain and affect extracellular proteins in [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1022.04s)]
*  the brain. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1027.08s)]
*  So there's an element of focus. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1028.08s)]
*  We're also early in our journey. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1029.1599999999999s)]
*  So we are in preclinical drug discovery. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1030.72s)]
*  There will be certainly things that we learn along the way that will shape where we want [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1033.02s)]
*  to point this technology. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1037.44s)]
*  But yeah, so we do focus on a set of diseases because we cannot tackle them all at once. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1039.0s)]
*  When you start developing something like this, you have the concept cost becomes something [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  that is an issue. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1050.44s)]
*  I don't know if you started to address that. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1052.56s)]
*  You can have a great idea, but then all of a sudden when it comes to fruition, you're [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1054.48s)]
*  looking at two million dollars per dose or per patient. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1058.36s)]
*  At what point do you start to say, okay, what is this going to cost? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1062.56s)]
*  Are we going to be able to do this at scale and keep costs low? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1067.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1071.8s)]
*  I think in some important ways, the molecular gates are new. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1073.56s)]
*  They're a new therapeutic modality, a new mechanism of action for a drug. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1078.24s)]
*  But the molecules that we're making at the end of the day are small molecule drugs. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1082.56s)]
*  And so there's actually an awful lot that we can learn and have learned from the most [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1086.56s)]
*  abundant class of therapeutics that exists today and have existed, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1091.52s)]
*  Small molecule chemical drugs. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1095.44s)]
*  So in contrast to other new modalities, say things like cell and gene therapy, there isn't [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1096.96s)]
*  quite the same sort of cost concerns in development because it's a much more conventional [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1103.84s)]
*  material that we're working with. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1109.44s)]
*  And then on the other part of your question related to costs of therapies at the end of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1111.28s)]
*  the day, the way I look at this is that we're going to try and make medicines that are the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1116.48s)]
*  best choice for patients who don't have other choices. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1120.48s)]
*  And if we do that successfully, everything will sort itself out. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1122.96s)]
*  How will this be administered to patients? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1126.96s)]
*  Yeah, the hope is and the anticipation is that the molecular gate medicines will be [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1130.56s)]
*  taken as a pill, as any other pill that you might take. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1134.8s)]
*  Small molecule shelf stable, taken orally, accessing the body as with any other small [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1137.6s)]
*  molecule drug. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1142.48s)]
*  That's the intent. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1143.36s)]
*  We're still several years from clinical testing of our first program. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1144.24s)]
*  So things may change along the way, but that is our goal. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1147.76s)]
*  Are you looking to be able to, through this technology, is it something that you're going [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1150.64s)]
*  to be able to cure diseases or are you going to be able to get to the point where something [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1155.76s)]
*  becomes manageable through repeat taking of a pill? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1161.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1166.08s)]
*  It sort of depends a bit on the specific diseases themselves. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1167.68s)]
*  So there are certain diseases where if you eliminate the disease causing protein, it's [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1171.84s)]
*  a one time insult. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1176.8799999999999s)]
*  If you can eliminate that protein, you could potentially cure the disease. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1177.92s)]
*  There are others where perhaps the extracellular protein is being produced regularly by your [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1182.08s)]
*  body and you need to reduce its levels below some pathogenic threshold. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1186.72s)]
*  And you might be taking the medicine on a more recurring basis to keep those extracellular [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1191.6s)]
*  protein levels in a healthy range. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1196.32s)]
*  So it really depends on the disease itself. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1199.44s)]
*  Can you take me through a little bit the formation of the company? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1201.76s)]
*  It becomes something bigger than just that initial idea, you know? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1205.84s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1209.76s)]
*  And I think for GATE, I think this is probably true for many biotech companies of our type, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1210.32s)]
*  the science and the technology really drives those early days. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1215.76s)]
*  You have an initial insight or initial observation. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1220.48s)]
*  You have to figure out, is it repeatable? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1223.04s)]
*  You have to figure out, can you do it? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1224.8s)]
*  Then you have to say, wait, I want to be able to do this at scale in the not too distant [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1226.72s)]
*  future so you can just start building out the technologies to be able to do that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1230.72s)]
*  And so really, the early days of GATE were around building out those technologies and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1234.8s)]
*  building that expertise, growing the team. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1239.52s)]
*  We started as three founders and rapidly grew to a team that's now 22 people, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1241.28s)]
*  mostly in San Francisco, many chemists and biologists and technologists building out [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1246.8799999999999s)]
*  the assays and the tools and the systems to be able to enable the vision that we have [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1252.0s)]
*  for molecular GATES. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1255.92s)]
*  And that continues. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1257.6s)]
*  We came out of stealth recently. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  We unveiled the company just a few weeks ago and announced our Series A fundraising [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1260.48s)]
*  of $60 million, which is a large sum. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1265.36s)]
*  And we're going to use that money basically to take this platform that we've built and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1267.76s)]
*  now start deploying it towards the programs that we want to pursue. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1272.56s)]
*  Mario Andretti, the race car driver, has a quote, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1276.8799999999999s)]
*  if things are under control, you're not going fast enough. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1279.76s)]
*  That speaks to the emotional side, perhaps, or how it feels to build a startup. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1282.16s)]
*  You're exactly right, Jim. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1286.56s)]
*  There's just so many things you need to build at the same time. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1287.36s)]
*  You can't build them all at the same time. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1290.32s)]
*  You have to find ways to stage it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1291.84s)]
*  But it's a really fun journey. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1293.68s)]
*  And you mentioned the fact that you've got $60 million. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1295.2s)]
*  Clearly, there's interest in what you're doing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  We hear the words disruptive an awful lot and we hear companies saying, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1302.0s)]
*  we've got something new. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1307.6s)]
*  You clearly do have something new. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1309.2s)]
*  How do you kind of elevate that discussion to the point where this isn't just disruptive? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1310.96s)]
*  This is really new. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1316.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're very fortunate to have the support of the syndicate that we have, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1318.08s)]
*  both the financial support, but also the know-how in building companies like this. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1322.48s)]
*  And actually, I do think a lot about how molecular gates are a new therapeutic class. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1326.4s)]
*  And in certain ways, we are trailblazers. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1332.64s)]
*  But we're also very clearly following a path that has been laid before us by others. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1335.44s)]
*  And that path is small molecules doing interesting things. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1339.92s)]
*  So if we think historically to small molecule chemical drugs, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1345.52s)]
*  I might miss one or two here, but I'm going to say that [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1349.6s)]
*  there are basically two classes. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1352.0s)]
*  You have the antagonists, small molecules that might come in and block an enzyme from [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1353.52s)]
*  functioning kinase inhibitors and things like that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1358.4s)]
*  You have small molecule agonists that would do the opposite, that would activate proteins. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1360.88s)]
*  But in the last maybe about 15 years or so, you've seen this wave of small molecules doing [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1365.28s)]
*  more interesting things. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1370.88s)]
*  Small molecules that covalently bind to proteins and actually form a new chemical [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1372.32s)]
*  bond with their target. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1376.64s)]
*  Small molecules that bind to RNA, not just to protein, but bind to RNA [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1377.76s)]
*  and affect the ability of the cell to produce proteins. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1381.52s)]
*  Small molecules that act as glues. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1384.24s)]
*  That's the term now, molecular glues, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1387.76s)]
*  Where a small molecule will attract two protein targets. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1389.52s)]
*  So I have two binding partners. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1393.04s)]
*  And by virtue of bringing those two proteins together, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1395.04s)]
*  will cause one protein to act on the other. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1397.6s)]
*  So to actually introduce protein-protein activity into a cell that might not have had it otherwise. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1399.6s)]
*  And flavors of glues, protein degradation, where one of those proteins is a degrader [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  and will chop up the other protein you want to get rid of. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1409.04s)]
*  So there's this whole world of small molecules doing interesting things. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1410.96s)]
*  And we've been very fortunate with the folks we've brought around the table, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1414.72s)]
*  is that they're folks who've actually really been instrumental in building [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1417.68s)]
*  many of these other small molecule modalities as investors, as scientists themselves, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1420.4s)]
*  as the leaders in pharma who shepherded these ideas from insights through to actual approved drugs. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  And so we try to bring this expertise around the table deliberately from the very early days [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1431.76s)]
*  and to try and learn the playbook from them as much as possible so we don't have to reinvent it [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1436.24s)]
*  ourselves. And I think that's really where the true magic comes when you assemble a team [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1440.8s)]
*  with this type of expertise. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1446.0s)]
*  They see something in us, clearly, that is interesting to them. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1447.6000000000001s)]
*  But we see something in them, that knowledge, that expertise, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1450.88s)]
*  and that ability to follow the playbook and try to make meaningful medicines for patients. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty exciting to be in the beginning of something new. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1458.0s)]
*  Obviously, you're fairly early on in that pathway. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1463.04s)]
*  What are the next steps for the company? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1466.56s)]
*  What we're going to do now with this Series A money is really deploy our platform technologies [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1469.28s)]
*  towards pushing programs forward. Our hope is that the lead programs might be ready for clinical [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1474.24s)]
*  testing in three to five years, although being around biotech for as long as you have, I'm sure, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1479.36s)]
*  Jim, you know that timelines can be hard to predict in the early days, but that's our aspiration. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1484.96s)]
*  And I do think to your point about being very early, I do hope that should we succeed, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1489.76s)]
*  we'll look back and there will be dozens of companies producing molecular gates for [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1496.16s)]
*  additional diseases. And so starting a whole class of medicines, we've seen that with glues [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1501.0400000000002s)]
*  and pro-tax and splice modulators and the like, that when a new innovation of how to intervene [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1505.2s)]
*  therapeutically comes onto the market, it can often lead to a real burgeoning of science and [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1510.48s)]
*  exploration around that mechanism. And boy, I hope that's the case, because as we talked earlier, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  there are many diseases caused by extracellular proteins. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1520.0800000000002s)]
*  We as GATE will take as many as we can, but we'll not be able to do all of them. And certainly, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  there are patients who are in need of better therapeutic options. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1528.48s)]
*  Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about that we haven't? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1531.28s)]
*  Just to say how excited we are to unveil the company. It's been a lot of hard work from a [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1535.52s)]
*  lot of folks. It's been really wonderful to bring the syndicate around the table that we have and [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1540.24s)]
*  the resources that they bring to bear. Drug development, drug discovery is hard, any new [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1545.04s)]
*  area of science is. And the only way you can possibly succeed is with the right team and the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1550.24s)]
*  right resources behind you. And very excited about this next stage of GATE. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1554.48s)]
*  It's always interesting to hear about new technologies that can make a big difference [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1563.44s)]
*  in the future. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1567.92s)]
*  And I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. Thanks for listening, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1574.56s)]
*  and you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG6KDz0X3es&t=1579.44s)]
