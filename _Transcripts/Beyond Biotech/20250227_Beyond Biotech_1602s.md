# Anocca’s VIDAR-1: Revolutionizing pancreatic cancer with TCR-T cell therapy
**Beyond Biotech:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 132. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=16.0s)]
*  Swedish based company Anoka is at the forefront of TCRT cell therapies and has a novel approach to T cell biology, biotechnology and integrated software. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=21.0s)]
*  To tell us about the company, its clinical trials and its partnerships is the company's CEO Regan Jarvis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=35.0s)]
*  Alright, so I guess to get things underway, I wonder if you could give us a bit of background on the company and its origins. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah, so Anoka is a T cell biotech, T cell biology biotech. We're based in Sweden and the company is built around a unique cell biology platform, which is built from the ground up to essentially address all the fundamental challenges across the discovery value chain for T cell therapies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=51.0s)]
*  That includes target mapping, the generation of T cell receptors, the targeting receptors of T cells and their characterization and optimization. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=71.0s)]
*  We've deployed that first of all in deploying TCRT cell therapies in the oncology space and built a very deep pipeline around that and construct our own manufacturing facility into which we've deployed a gene editing and manufacturing approach. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=80.0s)]
*  First clinical program under regulatory review right now in Europe, which should be enrolling Q2 of this year. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=95.0s)]
*  The origins of the company are a bit unusual in the sense that we're not an academic spin out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=102.0s)]
*  This was literally an idea on paper, which was kind of a critique of how people were trying to develop products in the T cell biology space. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=107.0s)]
*  And so we've built the company from the ground up, including all the technologies and capabilities with a very talented and international team. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=115.0s)]
*  So we've grown to about 130 people and over 40 nationalities represented in the team. So an exciting place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=123.0s)]
*  You mentioned TCRT cell therapy. I wonder if you could go into a bit of detail on what that is and the current level of use of that in treatments. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah, TCRT cell therapy is basically programming a T cell to become a targeted therapeutic. So it's a cell therapy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=140.0s)]
*  What you're doing is programming these T cells with a T cell receptor, a TCR. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=148.0s)]
*  And what they're doing is detecting native T cell targets, so HLA restricted peptides. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=153.0s)]
*  And these targets are derived from turnover of all the proteins inside cells getting chopped up and then loaded into these HLA complexes and presented at the cell surface. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=159.0s)]
*  So this is what T cells normally do. They open up a window and look inside cells and see if there's targets they should react to, like mutated proteins and cancer or dysregulated proteins in cancer or in a virology setting, viral proteins. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=169.0s)]
*  So TCRT cell therapies in the oncology space are really about opening up a really powerful and tumor selective target space. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=183.0s)]
*  So we're looking for things that are only expressed in tumors. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=193.0s)]
*  And the caveat to that is that there's a lot of targets there and they're different between individuals because of the genetic diversity of tumors and the genetic diversity of individuals in their HLA genes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=197.0s)]
*  So the challenge really here is in scaling out your discovery, product development and then clinical development. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=209.0s)]
*  The current level of use is interesting. The first TCRT cell therapy product was for oncology was approved just last year, a pharma cell from Adaptimmune. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=215.0s)]
*  And so that's a major A4 targeting product in the HLA A201 HLA restriction in synovial sarcoma, a relatively niche indication, a modest market opportunity. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=225.0s)]
*  Behind that, we're seeing AMADICS move forward to PRAME targeting product into melanoma phase three study. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=239.0s)]
*  And then behind that, we've got a very small handful of companies in phase one. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=247.0s)]
*  And of course, we'll be joining that small group earlier this year. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=253.0s)]
*  Your website mentions your novel approach to T cell biology and cutting edge biotech and integrated software. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=256.0s)]
*  I wonder if you could explain that a little. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=264.0s)]
*  Our approach is novel in the sense that we're approaching this from a cell biology lens. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=267.0s)]
*  So it sounds kind of obvious that we're making T cell therapies. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=272.0s)]
*  So we have to look at the cell biology, but it is surprisingly differentiated in the sense that everything we do across the discovery workflow is a cell based assay. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=276.0s)]
*  We map these HLA restricted peptide targets from any gene sequence in a cell based assay. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=285.0s)]
*  We generate the TCRs and then characterize these in very sophisticated assays where we can combine engineered T cells with engineered target cells in very precise and reproducible ways. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=290.0s)]
*  The biotechnologies behind that are essentially allowing us to construct the cells that go into the assays. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=301.0s)]
*  So this is a molecular genetics, molecular biology toolkit so that we can very quickly, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=307.0s)]
*  precisely and cost effectively generate these large libraries of cells that we deploy into analysis. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=313.0s)]
*  And then finally, on the software side of things, obviously a huge volume of quite bespoke data here to capture and analyze. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=319.0s)]
*  So we've constructed a software platform which does just that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=326.0s)]
*  Of course, it captures the data, does the bespoke bioinformatics in there and allows us to visualize the results. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=330.0s)]
*  And in addition to that, we've constructed that as a sort of an enterprise software built by us for us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=336.0s)]
*  So it does everything from laboratory protocol development and review to logistics inventory, reagent ordering, all of the above time management. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=341.0s)]
*  So it's enabling us to scale out the discovery in a very cost effective way and keep the standards of obviously laboratory execution, but also data collection and analysis to a very high standard. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=350.0s)]
*  What are you doing differently to other cell and gene therapy companies? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=362.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's that cell biology approach, sort of ground up approach to mapping targets first and foremost. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=367.0s)]
*  So oftentimes you're seeing companies and academics for that matter work through primary specimens, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=372.0s)]
*  whether they're grinding up tumors and looking for targets directly in that material or looking at patient T cells and T cell receptors and trying to de-orphanize them and go back to a target and a discovery methodology. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=380.0s)]
*  What we're doing from the ground up is saying in the oncology space, what is the tumor restricted genetic sequence? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=393.0s)]
*  Because there's lots of NGS data out there across many tumor forms across many patients. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=399.0s)]
*  So we can take that as a jumping off point and simply map the available HLA restricted peptide target space in those tumor restricted gene sequences. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=404.0s)]
*  And then downstream of that, we can systematically generate TCRs, characterize them and even optimize those in a directed evolution platform. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=412.0s)]
*  And the point of this is, again, everything's a cell based assay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=421.0s)]
*  So we're reading out the real cell biology at the center of both target presentation and T cell responsiveness, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=425.0s)]
*  which allows us to select optimal target receptor pairs and optimize those to go into products. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=431.0s)]
*  I would say that the key to this is scaling out your discovery and product development. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=437.0s)]
*  First approved product last year in TCRT. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=443.0s)]
*  Modality works. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=446.0s)]
*  It's a matter of scalability because of the highly segmented nature of the target space. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=448.0s)]
*  You need to build libraries of these products and personalize them to both patient genetics and the tumor target specifics of their disease. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=452.0s)]
*  So this is about scaling out discovery, scaling out manufacture, of course, product development commercialization. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=461.0s)]
*  And so this is at the heart of what we're doing is precision and scalability in all those sort of key points across that discovery product development value chain. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=467.0s)]
*  What kind of challenges does the approach that you're taking present? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=477.0s)]
*  There are a number of challenges. It's a complexity challenge. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=482.0s)]
*  This is non-trivial in terms of biology, which we would say we've solubilized. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=485.0s)]
*  We've solved that challenge and mapping the targets, making optimal receptors downstream of that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=490.0s)]
*  It's manufacturing. We're taking a gene edited autologous manufacturing approach for our first programs. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=496.0s)]
*  I would say we've buttoned that pretty tight as well. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=502.0s)]
*  And really beyond that is scalability. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=505.0s)]
*  Being able to do this again and again and again. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=507.0s)]
*  And we've built the business systems and obviously the R&D systems to do that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=510.0s)]
*  I think the key challenge facing the field right now is funding and financing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=514.0s)]
*  So I'd say that's the number one challenge that I'd point to as the CEO at Anoka. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=519.0s)]
*  But in terms of the science and product development, we think we've solubilized most of the challenges here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=524.0s)]
*  Looking beyond all that, really, it's about how do you build a commercial manufacturing distribution sales model behind these types of very advanced personalized therapies. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=529.0s)]
*  That's, in a way, future problems. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=539.0s)]
*  This is some years down the track, but we have our eye on that in terms of both the scalability of the manufacturing, the clinical immunology. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=542.0s)]
*  You'll need to actually stratify patients for selection, inclusion, so on and so forth in the future. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=550.0s)]
*  And with the programs that you're working on, what conditions or diseases are you looking to address? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=556.0s)]
*  Well, the first program is an oncology TCIT program focused on pancreatic cancer. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=563.0s)]
*  And the targets there will be mutant KRAS and various HLA restrictions. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=569.0s)]
*  And a little bit differently to some of the peers in this space is that this is a very focused single indication approach into pancreatic cancer. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=574.0s)]
*  Oftentimes you're seeing products against a certain target and HLA restriction trial in all comers across all oncology indications that have that target expression. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=583.0s)]
*  We're kind of saying it's a precision modality. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=593.0s)]
*  Let's do precision trials and focus down on two single indications that has a number of benefits. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=596.0s)]
*  One and first and foremost is you can design your clinical trial to integrate very closely with existing standard of care, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=602.0s)]
*  which gives you an opportunity to have a homogenized as much as you can patient population, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=609.0s)]
*  which allows some benefits in terms of manufacturing, timeliness and standardization and importantly allows you to interpret early stage data. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=616.0s)]
*  It's not a range of indications with a range of prior therapies. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=624.0s)]
*  That's a bit unique in terms of what we're setting up there. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=628.0s)]
*  Maybe to clarify is we are approaching this as a library of products, even in this first program. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=631.0s)]
*  So we'll have up to three TCRT products covering different K-RAS mutations and different HLA restrictions in our first clinical program for pancreatic cancer. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=637.0s)]
*  Was there a specific reason for choosing that condition as something that you wanted to go after? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=647.0s)]
*  PDAC or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an area of very high unmet medical need. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=655.0s)]
*  The five year survival here is about 10 percent. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=661.0s)]
*  There are not many treatment options here. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=665.0s)]
*  Patients often respond to the first line chemo, but very quickly relapse. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=667.0s)]
*  So median survival from diagnosis is in the order of eight, nine months. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=672.0s)]
*  So very high unmet need. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=676.0s)]
*  There are a number of reasons for choosing PDAC from a biology standpoint, from the quality of the mutant K-RAS targets there, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=678.0s)]
*  their homogeneity more or less across primary tumor and metastasis, but also, frankly, the immediacy of feedback on those clinical programs. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=685.0s)]
*  You're going to see your survival data fairly quickly. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=693.0s)]
*  There are some attributes to the standard of care where we've been able to be quite smart how we're integrating our therapy there. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=696.0s)]
*  So high unmet need, potential to make a big impact, but hard nosed both biology and commercial considerations to selecting that indication. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=703.0s)]
*  How would you define success in terms of what it means to the patient ultimately? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=713.0s)]
*  We're going in as necessitated as a second line therapy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=719.0s)]
*  So this is one advantage we have. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=723.0s)]
*  The patients aren't going through five, six, seven, eight lines of therapy like you might see in lung cancer. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=726.0s)]
*  That's not because of any other reason that there's no available lines of therapy as to what we're doing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=732.0s)]
*  So it is a chance at an effective therapy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=738.0s)]
*  More generally, I would say one of the promise around TCRT therapeutics is their potential for very high safety profile and low side effects. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=742.0s)]
*  So standard of care, a lot of these high met need conditions are very harsh cycles of chemotherapies, which are tough to take. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=752.0s)]
*  A lot of the times patients opt out of them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=761.0s)]
*  They physically cannot tolerate any more chemo. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=764.0s)]
*  And that's part of the patient management there. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=766.0s)]
*  So TCRTs as a precision therapy have the potential to provide very, very high efficacy, very low side effect treatment options here. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=769.0s)]
*  Having said that, you know, we're not dreamy eyed. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=779.0s)]
*  These aren't magic bullets. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=782.0s)]
*  There's a lot of work to do here with the TCRT modality. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=784.0s)]
*  And, you know, we're looking, as most others in the oncology space, I'd say all others in the oncology space, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=787.0s)]
*  at smart ways to combine our therapeutics with existing targeted agents and other targeted agents in development. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=793.0s)]
*  You know, combo therapies are a feature of oncology today. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=801.0s)]
*  They'll continue to be a feature even more so moving forward. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=804.0s)]
*  So that's part of our clinical strategy around PDAC. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=807.0s)]
*  And we really want to dig into that indication and make these therapies work and not just alone in combination with other, you know, oncology strategies. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=810.0s)]
*  What is Vida 1? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=820.0s)]
*  Vida 1 is the first clinical program. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=822.0s)]
*  Vida is a Norse god, calling out our Swedish origins here as a company. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=825.0s)]
*  And that is a TCRT oncology trial focus into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=830.0s)]
*  It'll be a multi-center trial here in Northern Europe. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=836.0s)]
*  So nine phase one centers and looking to obviously establish safety and early signs of efficacy for our TCRT products in that setting. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=840.0s)]
*  Could you tell me a bit about your partnerships with AmendoBio and Shinobi? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mentioned in the manufacturing background there that we're taking an autologous gene editor approach to our first TCRT products. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=854.0s)]
*  That gene editor is conducted with a CRISPR-Cas system with AmendoBio to deploy. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=862.0s)]
*  So essentially what we're doing is taking up TCR constructs and knocking them into the native TCR gene locus. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=868.0s)]
*  So we're delivering our construct whilst disrupting half of the receptor, which has some benefits in terms of potency and consistency of your product [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=877.0s)]
*  because you're getting rid of at least half of that endogenous receptor and there's no competition between existing TCR and therapeutic TCR. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=885.0s)]
*  It's also important in terms of that scalability I keep mentioning. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=894.0s)]
*  A lot of approaches are still using across the cell therapy space viral vectors for integration of receptor constructs. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=898.0s)]
*  And that has a challenge in terms of timeliness and cost to getting to new products first in human. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=905.0s)]
*  It's very expensive. It's very time consuming to make a viral vector. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=912.0s)]
*  With a gene editor approach, your CRISPR reagents are built to stock. They're universal. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=915.0s)]
*  And what you're doing for a new product is simply providing a DNA template for integration, which is much quicker and much more cost effective to bring new products to humans. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=921.0s)]
*  In terms of Shinobi you asked about, this is the flip side of the manufacturing challenge. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=932.0s)]
*  So Shinobi, Japanese US company, they're primarily an iPSC company. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=937.0s)]
*  So when she's very potent stem cells, we've partnered with them to explore iPSC derived alpha beta T cells as a universal off the shelf source of T cells for manufacturing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=942.0s)]
*  So we're working with Shinobi to bring their iPSC and T cell expertise with our T cell biology and TCR asset expertise to build a proof of concept around this scalable future manufacturing approach for T cell therapies. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=955.0s)]
*  You already mentioned scaling up and you've also mentioned again from your website creating off the shelf products. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=968.0s)]
*  How are you kind of moving towards that and scaling up and the associated costs to keep those as low as possible? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=975.0s)]
*  In terms of scale up, I would say that first challenge is scale out. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=983.0s)]
*  To demonstrate the potential of the TCRT modality, you need to access the target space, which you need to bring multiple products to bear. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=987.0s)]
*  So part of that is the gene editing approach. Part of that is the way we manufacture these products. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=994.0s)]
*  We have our in-house facility. We have in-house process development. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1000.0s)]
*  We have in-house technology development teams that feed our process development. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1004.0s)]
*  So we're working to a continuous improvement model both on the biotechnology side. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1008.0s)]
*  So what are the reagents, constructs, biological tools you can bring to bear, but also the equipment side of things. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1013.0s)]
*  So there's real life engineering solutions to bring to bear there as well. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1019.0s)]
*  So that's looking first and foremost to the scale out and of course, keeping in mind that you do need to scale up each of those individual products in the future. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1023.0s)]
*  So that goes hand in hand with selecting the best biology and the best engineering solutions to bring that to bear in the medium term. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1032.0s)]
*  In terms of the off-the-shelf products, I mentioned the collaboration with Shinobi. That would be our play at the moment to off-the-shelf manufacturing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1040.0s)]
*  That field has a number of, let's say, biological and technical hurdles to overcome. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1047.0s)]
*  It's difficult to scale IPSE differentiation. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1053.0s)]
*  The characteristics of those cells need to be optimized, not just in terms of potency, but also stealthing those cells from the patient immune system. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1056.0s)]
*  They'll be rejected just like most allografts over time or acutely in some cases. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1066.0s)]
*  So Shinobi is a great team. They've got a great technology base, both on the IPSE and the stealthing from host immune system. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1072.0s)]
*  We're very optimistic to bring some proof of concept during this year to move that forward. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1079.0s)]
*  How do you see TCRT therapy and the, I guess, the whole cell and gene therapy field evolving? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1084.0s)]
*  I'll stick to the T cell biology lens there maybe rather than having a general riff on cell and gene, which is very broad. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1093.0s)]
*  To address the target space, you need to bring many products to bear and even in single indications. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1100.0s)]
*  I think that is one major theme you'll see. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1106.0s)]
*  More generally speaking, if we say cell therapies and gene therapies where you could say that case is vaccination and vaccination-like strategies where you try to provoke or suppress T cell immunity in different disease settings. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1109.0s)]
*  One of the sort of matros across the field is there are a lot of great manufacturing platforms. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1123.0s)]
*  In the cell therapy space, a lot of investment behind CAR T initially into ways of manufacturing, ways of enhancing your cells and so on and so forth. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1129.0s)]
*  A lot of manufacturing capability and technology out there. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1139.0s)]
*  In the vaccine space, of course, we saw mRNA and LNP technologies come through, be validated during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, of course. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1143.0s)]
*  The theme really is there's a lot of capability to manufacture products, but the fundamental barrier to entry is what are you going to encode in those products? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1152.0s)]
*  That's really what ENOC has been built to address, is pulling apart the targets for T cells and, of course, being able to provide T cell receptors for cell therapies. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1163.0s)]
*  But more importantly, understand viral genomes or immune targets if you want to provide vaccination or tolerizing vaccine strategies. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1173.0s)]
*  I think the theme you'll see is more emphasis placed on what to encode in these manufacturing platforms, which is, in a way, part of the overall trend in the industry where you see modalities being able to manufacture before the real energy behind it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1182.0s)]
*  It's just unique in the T cell biology space because that target, the target space, whatever indication you look at, is segmented and requires that scalability I keep talking about. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1196.0s)]
*  I think one of the biggest buzzwords at the moment in the industry seems to be artificial intelligence. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1206.0s)]
*  Is that impacting what you're doing? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1212.0s)]
*  The large language models, the generative AI generally impacts all businesses to an extent. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1215.0s)]
*  People are using those tools to search and summarize, which is what they're good at. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1221.0s)]
*  In terms of clinical development, you're seeing a lot of value to add in clinical development in terms of patient population selection, stratification, the downstream stuff there in clinical development. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1226.0s)]
*  And that's owing to the fact that you've got really deep patient records, genomic data and so on that you can crunch in machine learning models. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1240.0s)]
*  In terms of discovery in the cell and gene therapy space, there's really limited use cases at this stage. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1248.0s)]
*  And that's not to say there's not potential, but there certainly is. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1254.0s)]
*  But the challenge with cell therapies in particular is that they're cells. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1258.0s)]
*  It's very hard to model, even if you had very good quantitative, high parameterized data. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1264.0s)]
*  Certainly our platform is designed to build that data. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1272.0s)]
*  We're not there today. I don't think anyone really is. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1276.0s)]
*  And that's a view on why we've put a lot of effort into our fundamental software platform, being able to capture that data, categorize it and have that warehoused. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1279.0s)]
*  So when we think we've got enough volume of data in specific use cases, we can start building those models on the cell therapy side. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1290.0s)]
*  I would say there's one exception here. It's the target mapping. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1298.0s)]
*  This is an unusually tractable area where the HLA restricted peptides formulaic in the way that they're loaded into certain HLA's. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1302.0s)]
*  There are patterns and there are rules, loose rules in some cases to that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1311.0s)]
*  And that you can quite well model which peptides will fit in which HLA's. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1315.0s)]
*  And that's the basis, for example, of personalized cancer vaccines from BioNTech. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1321.0s)]
*  Just as an example, they're using computational models to predict which neoantigens, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1327.0s)]
*  which cancer specific targets should be encoded in this personalized vaccine on a patient by patient basis. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1333.0s)]
*  I would say that more generally, if you're getting away from that fully individualized space, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1341.0s)]
*  which we think you have to in the cell therapy setting just because of your relative complexity of the products to develop, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1346.0s)]
*  that the number of products you have to bring to bed just don't really need that. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1352.0s)]
*  If you've built a platform like we have to analyze the cell biology, you analyze the cell biology. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1357.0s)]
*  You have to do it anyway. We're doing that in a scalable manner. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1363.0s)]
*  You don't need those machine learning leg ups in the first instance. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1366.0s)]
*  All that's to say that potential, but you need a lot more data. You need a lot more high quality data. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1371.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a theme when a lot of people talk about AI. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1376.0s)]
*  People often say rubbish in, rubbish out. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1379.0s)]
*  And I think that's particularly the case for complex biology like the target T cell interaction at the center of the modalities we work with. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1381.0s)]
*  You mentioned joining the party in 2025. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1390.0s)]
*  I wonder if you could take us through the timeline of where you're going with trials and where the company's going. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1394.0s)]
*  Yes, so this first program is under regulatory review here in Europe. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1401.0s)]
*  So we'll see that all going well, start enrolling Q2 of this year. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1405.0s)]
*  We'll expect a phase one readout on the first product of that program, second half of 2026, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1410.0s)]
*  and accelerate that recruitment with activation of more sites to have a phase 2A readout in second half of 2027. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1416.0s)]
*  So relatively modest patient numbers, of course, in the TCRT setting. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1426.0s)]
*  So quite quick, relatively speaking, to get these trial readouts. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1432.0s)]
*  More generally, I think what we're looking at is more programs because I keep saying it's scalability. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1437.0s)]
*  We need to address this target space. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1444.0s)]
*  We have a very deep pipeline of oncology assets and have some opportunities there. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1446.0s)]
*  We're also looking very hard at non-oncology applications for TCRT therapies. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1451.0s)]
*  So we're looking to launch a second clinical program towards the end of next year, 2026, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1456.0s)]
*  but not announcing what that will be, not even the disease area it will be in right now. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1462.0s)]
*  This is the trajectory for the companies is leveraging this discovery engine that we've generated to map targets, make assets, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1467.0s)]
*  and of course, the manufacturing capability we have to actually deploy those to human trials on a continuous basis. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1475.0s)]
*  Certainly, we're platform biotech comes in and out of fashion that that expression, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1481.0s)]
*  but we're looking to run platform biotech business model, which is your whole young programs to build proof of concept, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1487.0s)]
*  build value around those products and the company and partner in smart ways with pharma and big biotech to do discovery programs, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1493.0s)]
*  product co-development and so on to further validate, obviously, the platform and spread the risk in some sense, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1501.0s)]
*  but also just execute on that business model, which frankly has been the only model to be successful as a platform biotech. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1509.0s)]
*  Great. Thank you. Is there anything that you would like to add? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1515.0s)]
*  It's an exciting year for Anoka. We're entering the clinic for the first time as a company and on the back of now 11 years of buildup of the company. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1519.0s)]
*  We've put a lot of time and effort and obviously capital into building a discovery engine and pipeline, of course, the manufacturing capabilities. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1529.0s)]
*  And now it's where rubber hits the road, developing products and trialing them in humans is what this industry is all about. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1536.0s)]
*  And so it's exciting time for the team. It is a great team. Scientists, obviously engineers, body management people. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbXhri_Q2xc&t=1543.0s)]
