# Unlocking the dark genome: New therapies for obesity
**Beyond Biotech:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 129. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. This week we're going over to the dark side, or more accurately, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=17.76s)]
*  Last year, Hyotherapeutics landed a $1 billion deal with Eli Lilly to apply its long non-coding [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=26.36s)]
*  RNA technology to obesity. And we will find out about that deal, what the dark genome is, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=34.8s)]
*  and how it is related to disease and treating disease. Because our guest this week is Hyotherapeutics [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  CEO and co-founder Samir Unzain. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=49.92s)]
*  I wonder if we could start by telling me a bit about the company. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=55.6s)]
*  So Hyotherapeutics is a precision what we would consider next generation by a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=58.96s)]
*  pharma company that's really leveraging RNA for targeting or combating common and chronic [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  diseases that have historically been intractable. And the way we're doing that at Hyothera is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  really by focusing on a new area of biology. So we're taking a, I think you would call it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=77.16s)]
*  first in biology approach, leveraging RNA is derived from what some people call the dark genome. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=82.12s)]
*  So this is the 98% of your genome actually that does not code for protein. You may remember when [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  it was called junk DNA. Our approach is really driving insights and driving drug discovery and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=94.04s)]
*  drug development to actually start targeting the dark genome to precisely control what we think of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=101.2s)]
*  the fundamental unit of common and chronic diseases, which is cell states. So most of the common and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=106.92s)]
*  chronic diseases that have a large impact on society, they're essentially caused by your cells [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=112.92s)]
*  speaking to the environment and speaking to the common genetic variation that you have embedded [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=118.12s)]
*  within your genome. And what's become very apparent is the information processing in your genome, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=122.76s)]
*  how your genome speaks to the environment to change cell states to drive these disease driving [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  processes in common chronic disease. It's not happening at the level of messenger RNAs or [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=135.08s)]
*  protein coding genes. It's actually happening at the level of the dark genome, the so-called [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=139.56s)]
*  98% of your genome that used to be called junk. And what we've really been pioneering over the last [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=144.28s)]
*  four years now is this concept that the RNA from the dark genome can actually provide you with a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=150.52s)]
*  very precise, safe and effective substrate to reprogram its activity and therefore control [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=156.68s)]
*  cell state transitions that drive these disease processes. One obvious example being fibrosis. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=163.8s)]
*  So that's ultimately what we're doing at Hire. We're pioneering these RNA guided [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=169.96s)]
*  therapies to reprogram disease driving cell states. And the ultimate vision actually of Hire [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=174.6s)]
*  is to enable a world enriched by an extended health span by developing these highly precise, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=180.04s)]
*  safe and accessible RNA targeting medicines for these type of diseases. And of course, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=186.12s)]
*  many of these diseases, as you're aware, are highly associated with age. So many of these [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=191.88s)]
*  common and chronic diseases plague societies, in particular aging societies. And maybe just the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=197.72s)]
*  last point I would mention, I think it's fair to say that despite all of the amazing advances and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=203.88s)]
*  innovations in the biopharma industry over the last 20 to 50 years, common and chronic diseases [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=209.56s)]
*  are still a major unmet medical need. And we think our first in biology approach going after the dark [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=215.56s)]
*  genome can start to unlock real therapeutic applications in these disease indications. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=220.76s)]
*  I wonder before we first get into some of the nitty gritty about what you do, if you could [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  give us a bit of background on lung non-coding RNA and the dark genome and what they are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=232.44s)]
*  The dark genome is this what's called non-coding regions of the genome. And what we've understood [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=240.2s)]
*  actually in the area of epigenetics is that the dark genome is the location where most of the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=246.52s)]
*  epigenetics happen. So we know that epigenetics is central for how your genome speaks to the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=251.72s)]
*  environment and how your cells change in response to environmental signals. But what actually [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=257.16s)]
*  happened, this was around 2010. So with the advances of massively highly parallel sequencing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=263.0s)]
*  based approaches, we were able to start looking not just at all of the DNA in your genome, but we [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=271.0s)]
*  could start assessing all of the RNA produced by your genome. And around 2010 and 11, what became [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=276.44s)]
*  very apparent is most of the RNA produced by your genome is not coding from messenger RNA. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=283.32s)]
*  It's actually derived from this dark genome, this region of the genome where the epigenetics happen. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=289.0s)]
*  And these RNAs, the technical term for them are actually lung non-coding RNAs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=294.36s)]
*  And it's really emerged now, in particular over the last decade, that they are the trans actors of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  this information processing. They bridge the world of proteins with the digital world of your genome [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  in how it responds to the environment. So these lung non-coding RNAs, or they can also be called [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=310.84s)]
*  link RNAs, are really emerging as central integrators and information processes for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=317.0s)]
*  transacting this activity in your non-coding dark genome. And why is this quite exciting from a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=322.76s)]
*  drug development or discovery perspective? Well, these RNAs actually are highly specific. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=329.08s)]
*  So the activity of the dark genome is very exquisitely specific to specific cell states, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=335.72s)]
*  in specific tissues, and specific diseases. So what that means is if you can drug that activity, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=341.24s)]
*  you can have potentially not just a very potent effect because of the biology of these molecules, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=346.76s)]
*  but potentially a very precision, safe and specific effect due to the specificity of its [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=352.04s)]
*  activity. And these RNAs are conferring that. And what's beautiful about RNAs, obviously, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=357.56s)]
*  emerged as a really exciting therapeutic biomolecule, especially over the last five [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  years, is we now have a toolbox of modalities, genetic medicines, that allow us to start [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=368.92s)]
*  drugging and targeting RNA molecules. So by leveraging these RNAs as a substrate for genetic [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=374.92s)]
*  medicine approaches, we can start intervening and reprogramming the regulatory genome, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=380.92s)]
*  and therefore reprogramming these disease-driving cell state transitions, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=385.56s)]
*  having what we believe will be truly disease-modifying effects in these common and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=389.72s)]
*  chronic disease areas. What's the connection between LNC RNA and disease? Yeah. So I think [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  there are two clues that really have brought these long-known coding RNAs into focus in terms [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=404.76s)]
*  of causality. So why are they potentially causally responsible for the disease-driving [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=411.16s)]
*  processes underlying these common and chronic diseases? Well, first of all, there's the biology [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=417.0s)]
*  and the mechanisms associated with these RNAs. One of their central mechanisms is to coordinate [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=423.0s)]
*  the activity of, for example, epigenetic factors and transcription factors that control cellular [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=428.12s)]
*  behavior. And we know that cell state transitions are what drive the pathophysiological processes [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=433.8s)]
*  responsible, ultimately, for tissue dysfunction. So we know that the cells changing in response [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=440.76s)]
*  to the environment drive tissue dysfunction and disease, and these RNAs are central to the biological [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=447.0s)]
*  root cause mechanisms that causally regulate that process. But there are two other features that I [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=452.2s)]
*  think are really interesting about these RNAs, which is more broadly the activity of the epigenome, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=458.12s)]
*  epigenetics, and secondly, where most of the common genetic variation is found that is associated with [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=465.64s)]
*  common and chronic diseases. So you'll probably remember post the genome sequencing era, there was [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=472.76s)]
*  this huge wave of what we call genome-wide association studies looking for common and also [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=478.6s)]
*  rare but primarily common genetic variants across the population that predispose you to these common [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=485.64s)]
*  and chronic diseases like heart attack, for example, or other types of common diseases, diabetes, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=491.56s)]
*  obesity. And there was actually quite a shock in the 2010s that we were finding all of this genetic [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=496.68s)]
*  variation associated with common and chronic disease, but only 2% of these variants were mapping [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=503.08s)]
*  to messenger RNAs and proteins. So actually, 98% of the significant genetic variation associated [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=509.4s)]
*  with common and chronic disease, it's not found in the coding portion of the genome, it's found in the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=516.28s)]
*  dark genome. So essentially, we have these two big clues. We know that epigenetics controls how you [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  respond to the environment, and the biggest risk factor for most of these common and chronic diseases [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  is your lifestyle, it's the environment. And we know that the predisposition to how you respond [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=532.28s)]
*  to the environment to develop these diseases is encoded by common genetic variation, which is [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=537.32s)]
*  primarily non-coding in the dark genome. And what we've now realized is the epigenetics and the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=543.24s)]
*  common genetic variation linked to these diseases, it's actually enriched in these RNAs associated [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=549.08s)]
*  with the dark genome. So I think they are probably two of the biggest drivers of causality and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  evidence linking this new class of biological targets to these so far intractable common and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=559.48s)]
*  chronic disease driving cell state processes. So once you've determined that, I guess, how do [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=566.28s)]
*  you connect that? And how do you connect the dots? And how do you address diseases with that knowledge? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=574.04s)]
*  Yeah, so there are two parts to this. The first part, which I think is where Hire has really [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=580.52s)]
*  pioneered with our platform is the dark genome is 98% of your genome. It's a lot of DNA and a lot of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  RNA being produced from that DNA. So how do you actually identify those key RNAs, those key long [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=593.88s)]
*  non-coding RNAs that are causal in a specific and sensitive manner for the disease driving [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=601.48s)]
*  cell state process that you're interested in, that you know, if you can reprogram or intervene, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=607.4s)]
*  will have truly disease modifying therapeutic effects. So that is a huge data science, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=612.92s)]
*  computational biology and functional genomic exercise, both to curate the dark genome and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=618.44s)]
*  then to take those essentially high quality proprietary curations of these RNAs. Because [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=623.64s)]
*  just a little teaser, most of these RNAs, I mentioned that they're exquisitely specific [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=629.4s)]
*  to an individual cell type and an individual disease. This actually represents a double-edged [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=634.84s)]
*  sword for drug discovery. Because unless you precisely curate and map the activity of the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=639.88s)]
*  dark genome in given cell types in patients during disease progression, you won't even find these [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=645.4s)]
*  RNAs annotated in any reference public databases. So the first thing you actually need to do is to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=651.16s)]
*  build your own curation and discover these RNAs in the cell states and indications that you care [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=657.24s)]
*  about. That's a huge effort using multimodal genomic approaches on patient material. But once [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=663.56s)]
*  you've generated the high quality input data that allows you to curate the dark genome, how do you [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=669.56s)]
*  then actually annotate and discover these RNAs? That's a computational exercise. And then how do [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=674.92s)]
*  you triage or identify within literally tens of thousands of these molecules you can discover [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=680.92s)]
*  in any given tissue and cell state? We will typically discover 30 to 50,000 of these that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=687.4799999999999s)]
*  are completely novel in any given specific cell state. How do you then enrich for those that are [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=692.5999999999999s)]
*  causal and master regulators of the cell state transition? So that itself is quite a sophisticated [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=698.28s)]
*  exercise using, I would say, cutting edge computational biology approaches and algorithms, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=705.24s)]
*  statistical methods, statistical learning to understand causality. So that's the first piece [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=710.52s)]
*  of the puzzle where Hire has really built, I think, one of the leading platforms in the world to do [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=716.84s)]
*  that. But once you've identified that target where you have conviction around causality and it has [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=722.44s)]
*  the features of a good drug target, highly specific to the disease, only expressed in the disease [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=728.28s)]
*  driving cell state, so features that will render it not just an effective target but a very safe [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=734.04s)]
*  target, how do you then actually drug it? Well here at Hire we're essentially standing on the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=739.0s)]
*  shoulders of the giants that over the last 20 years have been developing and optimizing genetic [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=744.52s)]
*  medicines, primarily oligonucleotide-based approaches to target RNA. So here we can [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=750.52s)]
*  leverage what's already been developed in a programmable way to design, for example, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=756.8399999999999s)]
*  antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, to engage these novel targets, to, for example, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=762.28s)]
*  degrade them or to, for example, impact the ability of these targets to interact with proteins [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=769.16s)]
*  to have a disease modifying effect. So there are the two points to the discovery side and the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=775.88s)]
*  development side that we really have invested a lot of time, effort and resources, the team at Hire, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=781.24s)]
*  over the last four years to be able to do exactly that. And of course once we've done that we're [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=786.44s)]
*  able to quite rapidly start translating these novel targets and these drug targets into pre-clinical [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=792.2800000000001s)]
*  and ultimately clinical models. And how then did you make the decision as to what diseases or [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=799.8000000000001s)]
*  conditions you were going to tackle? Yeah great question. So the way we approached this was [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  what are the unique features of this biology? So the unique features are that these RNAs in [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=815.72s)]
*  the dark genome can precisely control cell state transitions in a tissue and disease specific manner. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=821.72s)]
*  And then we asked the question what is a disease driving cell state transition that is associated [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  with many, many common and chronic diseases where we have had limited success? And that brought us [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=833.4s)]
*  to this process of fibrosis, tissue scarring. So fibrosis is essentially caused by resting, let's [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=839.08s)]
*  say, healthy quiescent fibroblasts in your heart, in your lungs, in your kidney, in your liver, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=845.88s)]
*  becoming activated to a myofibroblast which is a disease driving state which through the deposition [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=851.64s)]
*  of collagen and other types of biomolecules essentially causes tissue dysfunction. Now I'm [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=858.12s)]
*  sure you're aware we haven't had a lot of success developing anti-fibrotic medicines [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=863.96s)]
*  despite one in three deaths being caused by this process of fibrosis. And the reason we haven't had [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=870.2s)]
*  a lot of success is because the industry has been focused on the signaling pathways and the proteins [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  that activate fibroblasts. Now many of these proteins and signaling pathways are highly pleiotropic [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=883.24s)]
*  so think of pathways like TGF-B to signaling. So what happens is you develop modalities to block [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=889.16s)]
*  these pro-fibrotic pathways, you give them to patients and typically these anti-fibrotic [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=895.7199999999999s)]
*  clinical trials fail in phase two because of limited efficacy. And the reason efficacy is [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=901.0799999999999s)]
*  limited is because the therapeutic window is very small that impacts dosing. Why is the therapeutic [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=906.36s)]
*  window so small? When you're targeting these protein-based targets that are pan-fibrotic [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=912.04s)]
*  activators you have on-target effects wherever fibroblasts are in the body. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=917.4s)]
*  So when you connected those dots we realized that with this biology we could identify [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=922.52s)]
*  precise fibroblast activators that are only ever expressed for example in an activated fibroblast [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=927.72s)]
*  in the heart. So targets that control fibrosis in the heart that are not expressed in any other [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=934.12s)]
*  fibroblast across the body. So what that allows you to do immediately is imagine precision [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=939.4s)]
*  anti-fibrotic drug development which we think was a great way to start entering this space of common [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=944.84s)]
*  and chronic diseases. And indeed our lead program is targeting fibrosis in the heart. We now have [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=950.2800000000001s)]
*  novel targets that are being validated in pre-clinical models that are moving through [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=956.9200000000001s)]
*  our development pipeline for fibroblast activation in the lung, so pulmonary fibrosis. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=961.1600000000001s)]
*  And last but not least the role of fibroblasts in solid tumors and within the tumor microenvironment. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=966.44s)]
*  So fibroblast plasticity is really important in the tumor stroma and this process of desmoplasia [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=971.72s)]
*  which is really really a burden in many solid tumors like for example pancreatic. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=978.52s)]
*  So that is how we thought about leveraging the biology but maybe we'll touch upon it after. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=983.8000000000001s)]
*  Any disease-driving cell state transition can be targeted using our platform. Just last year [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=989.24s)]
*  actually we announced our first collaboration with Eli Lilly to deploy our platform in areas [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=994.44s)]
*  outside of fibrosis. So we think there's a huge opportunity for this technology. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1000.6s)]
*  You mentioned the platform that's the Echo Hire. Could you tell me how that works? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1005.08s)]
*  There's a number of components to it in terms of curation, discovering long-run coding RNAs [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1010.84s)]
*  and also discovering the features or elements within these RNAs that synchronize or harmonize [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1017.0s)]
*  their activity as you could think of them as logic gates. So what we've actually been able [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1023.96s)]
*  to develop is ways to fine-tune the effect on cell state changes. So by targeting these individual [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1029.64s)]
*  long-run coding RNAs we can for example control the ability of a myofibroblast to revert back to a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  quiescent fibroblast. However by targeting the logic gates that synchronize the activity of these [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1042.2s)]
*  RNAs we can actually have more potent reprogramming effects and potentially not only block the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1048.8400000000001s)]
*  activation of a disease-driving cell state but increase resilience of cell states. So we could [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1055.88s)]
*  increase the resilience and potentially rejuvenate certain cell states in for example the context of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1062.5200000000002s)]
*  an aging associated indication. So that is essentially what Echo Hire allows us to do. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1068.7600000000002s)]
*  It allows us to fine-tune the cell state reprogramming effects we want [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1074.2800000000002s)]
*  via targeting the logic gates within these RNA networks. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1078.44s)]
*  You already mentioned your lead candidate. I wonder if you could [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1082.68s)]
*  go into a little bit more detail on that and how it works? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1085.88s)]
*  Yeah sure. So our lead candidate is a synthetic modified antisense oligonucleotide [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1089.48s)]
*  that has been developed to target a novel long-run coding RNA that we discovered [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1095.64s)]
*  called WISPR. And WISPR is a long-run coding RNA that specifically regulates the activation [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1100.44s)]
*  of fibroblasts in the heart. And furthermore when you engage WISPR in a dose-dependent manner you [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1106.68s)]
*  can reprogram fibroblasts. So you can reprogram the disease-driving activated fibroblasts and [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1113.96s)]
*  induce a switching back to a resting quiescent state. And why that is really important is because [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1120.04s)]
*  the activated fibroblasts in the heart what they do is they secrete lots of collagens into the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  interstitial space so they cause an expansion of the extracellular matrix leading to fibrosis [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1132.36s)]
*  which leads to stiffening of the heart as well as secreting a number of signaling molecules that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1138.52s)]
*  for example have detrimental effects on the functional cells within the heart and on the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1144.44s)]
*  immune cells within the heart to increase inflammation. So you can think of these activated [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1149.16s)]
*  myofibroblasts in the heart as sentinel cells that control the pathological remodelling of the heart [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1154.2s)]
*  that ultimately leads to heart failure. In particular heart failure with preserved [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1159.96s)]
*  ejection fraction. So this is diastolic dysfunction the poor relaxation of the heart. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  Now heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is responsible for half of heart failure [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1169.96s)]
*  globally and as you're probably aware we have limited disease modifying therapies approved [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1175.24s)]
*  for that type of heart failure. So an absolutely gigantic unmet medical need with very limited [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1180.8400000000001s)]
*  options. So what we've developed is an antisense that can block this long non-coding RNA block and [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1186.76s)]
*  reverse fibrosis in the heart and we're now translating it and we'll be hopefully going [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1193.08s)]
*  into a first in subject clinical trial in around 12 months from now. We'll be targeting this in [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1198.36s)]
*  the context of heart failure with diastolic dysfunction initially in patients who are symptomatic [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1204.28s)]
*  for diastolic dysfunction as a consequence of a relatively rare genetic structural heart disease [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1209.56s)]
*  called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So this impacts around 300,000 patients in the United States. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1215.88s)]
*  Preference globally is around one in 500 people. So it's a structural heart disease associated with [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1223.16s)]
*  genetic lesions that results essentially in diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. And what's [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1229.48s)]
*  been understood is that one of the major disease drivers in these patients is this process of [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1235.4s)]
*  cardiophibrosis. So we believe that this will be a first in biology, first in class anti-fibrotic [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1240.84s)]
*  disease modifying therapy for structural remodelling of the heart which could hopefully rapidly bring [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1246.6799999999998s)]
*  optionality for patients suffering with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but of course [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1252.84s)]
*  rapidly expand into larger heart failure patient populations including those patients suffering [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1257.6399999999999s)]
*  with diastolic dysfunction or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. So is that kind of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1263.0s)]
*  stopping it in its tracks so that it doesn't get any worse or is it reversing it to a state that [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1269.08s)]
*  looks like you never had it? So the first objective will be to block fibrosis progression but due to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1274.6s)]
*  the mechanism and the cell state reprogramming effects we've seen in our pre-clinical animal [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1281.4s)]
*  models we also believe there is a possibility that we can reverse remodel the heart so we can [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1285.72s)]
*  induce reversal of established fibrosis within the heart. But the first primary objective is just to [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1291.24s)]
*  block fibrosis progression because even by blocking fibrosis progression in patients with [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1297.32s)]
*  heart failure you could have a very significant impact on hard outcomes like hospitalisation and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1304.04s)]
*  death over time in these patients. So that is the first objective with the potential exciting [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1310.2s)]
*  scenario that we may also see reversal in humans. Excellent news yeah. Are there many companies [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1316.52s)]
*  working on the dark genome and long non-coding RNAs? I mean I'm really happy to say that over [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1323.96s)]
*  the last five years this field this first in biology field there's a lot of peer and pioneering [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1330.6000000000001s)]
*  companies that are really trying to develop orthogonal and complementary approaches to [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1336.2s)]
*  targeting the dark genome. As I mentioned it's 98% of your genome. I would if I had to put a number [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1341.24s)]
*  of how many of these long non-coding RNAs truly exist you could be talking about orders of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1348.2s)]
*  magnitude more than messenger RNAs so getting towards the million number. So there's huge [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1353.56s)]
*  untapped potential and I'm really happy that there's now many many companies entering the space that [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1359.8s)]
*  are using different approaches to target long non-coding RNAs both using oligonucleotide based [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1366.84s)]
*  therapies but also there's emerging approaches using small molecule approaches to interfere with [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  the ability of long non-coding RNAs interacting with the effectors of their mechanisms which are [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1378.04s)]
*  proteins. I think many of the approaches are focusing in the oncology space and maybe more [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1382.76s)]
*  rare diseases for example context where haploin sufficiency is a problem but absolutely it's [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1388.84s)]
*  becoming an attractive space. There's a lot of I think truly disease modifying options in this [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1394.92s)]
*  therapeutic area and not only is small companies but also big companies are starting to pay attention [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1399.72s)]
*  to the space and as evidenced I think by a couple of recent partnerships in this space both by [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1405.08s)]
*  ourselves with Eli Lilly and also one of our peer companies NextRNA who announced a collaboration [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1410.6s)]
*  with Bayer in the oncology space targeting these long non-coding RNAs. Can you go into a bit more [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1416.6799999999998s)]
*  detail on the deal with Lilly? Yeah so at a very high level as I mentioned up top our platform [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1422.6s)]
*  really allows us to reprogram cell state transitions and as you can imagine when you think [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1430.28s)]
*  about diseases like obesity and related metabolic diseases these are diseases caused by the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1435.64s)]
*  environment changing cell states so essentially what our collaboration with Eli Lilly is going [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1441.3200000000002s)]
*  to allow us to do and support them with is really identifying novel dark genome link RNA targets [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1447.0800000000002s)]
*  that can in a disease modifying way influence cell state transitions that could have you could [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1454.5200000000002s)]
*  imagine next generation or complementary disease modifying effects in obesity and the related [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1460.36s)]
*  metabolic diseases around that. So we're super excited because we think this is really a real [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1466.6s)]
*  validation of the platform that we've built. We're now able to start deploying the platform outside [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1472.52s)]
*  of the fibrosis arena and of course we have one of the really most innovative pioneering [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1478.28s)]
*  pharma companies in the world to work with us and to collaborate taking this biology [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1483.7199999999998s)]
*  into new indication areas like obesity. It seems like almost the new frontier of medicine. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1488.76s)]
*  We obviously think that there's huge opportunity and I think what's interesting is if you look [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1497.56s)]
*  at the industry in general and unmet medical needs in general especially associated with a lot of the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1502.28s)]
*  burden and the economic pressures we're facing with aging populations common and chronic diseases [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1508.04s)]
*  are becoming very very important to start tackling today and I would argue that if you [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1514.2s)]
*  follow the biology of what actually causes common and chronic disease independent of the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1520.52s)]
*  direction that you approach it attention starts to focus on the information part of your genome [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1525.24s)]
*  where this software is programmed and that is the dark genome. So we think there's really a huge [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1531.0800000000002s)]
*  opportunity especially using the emerging types of genetic medicines to start making common and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1537.4s)]
*  chronic disease truly tractable and maybe what I would just double down on in terms of the advantages [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1544.44s)]
*  of this approach is when you're thinking about common and chronic diseases you really need three [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1549.8000000000002s)]
*  fundamental things in any new medicine. You need the medicine to be highly effective so root cause [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1555.4s)]
*  biology. What is the root cause driving the manifestation of that disease? So think of cell [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1561.16s)]
*  state transitions think of the cell as the fundamental unit of these common and chronic [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1566.84s)]
*  diseases in terms of how it responds to the environment but you also need the medicine to [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1572.28s)]
*  be very very safe you're going to be treating potentially millions and millions of patients [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1576.84s)]
*  so you need very effective and very very safe medicines and last but not least you need highly [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1581.9599999999998s)]
*  accessible medicines. So when you think about our biological target class we have what we believe [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1588.1999999999998s)]
*  truly disease modifying causality and effectiveness in terms of the mechanisms of these molecules [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1593.72s)]
*  their unprecedented specificity we think makes them very very safe targets and we can leverage [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1599.72s)]
*  modalities like antisense oligonucleotides or small interferonarines that scale up and manufacturing [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1607.0s)]
*  and cost of goods are actually turning these genetic medicines into highly accessible modalities [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1614.92s)]
*  for common and chronic disease for everybody so I think that's what makes this new biological [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1621.16s)]
*  target space very exciting we can truly start to think about effective safe and accessible medicines [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1626.44s)]
*  for these large indications. And what is the implication for cost in that? Well the CMC the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  manufacturing and the scale of production of RNA based medicines I think we already saw with the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1641.16s)]
*  COVID vaccine mRNA synthesis can scale and it's exactly the same with oligonucleotides. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1646.76s)]
*  So the CMC manufacturing processes I would say are somewhat more tractable for large-scale patient [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1654.04s)]
*  populations than maybe some of the the other types of approaches that are leading edge or cutting edge. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1661.8s)]
*  So I think what we can bring to the table is first in biology innovation in target space for disease [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1667.8799999999999s)]
*  modification but what we can leverage so we have relatively high but transform high biological risk [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1674.44s)]
*  but potential transformational biological intervention but relatively low technology [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1680.44s)]
*  risk in terms of using oligonucleotides both in terms of safety tens of thousands of patients we [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1685.8s)]
*  have over half a dozen approved now oligonucleotide based therapies tens of thousands of patients have [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1692.68s)]
*  been dosed with oligonucleotide therapies we know the class associated safety and pk [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1699.24s)]
*  but what we also know is that the scale up on manufacturing in the CMC means you could have [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1705.16s)]
*  costs of goods that allow you to treat hundreds of thousands if not millions of patients in a [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1711.24s)]
*  commercially viable manner and I think that's what's exciting about this new frontier. Where are you at [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1717.4s)]
*  in terms of the pathway from where you are now to commercialization that clinical trial path I guess? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1724.76s)]
*  Yeah so with our lead program we're around 12 months from going into first in human and with [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1733.4s)]
*  the current path hopefully in 24 to 36 months from now we're reaching a point where we can [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1739.24s)]
*  demonstrate proof of mechanism for this first in biology approach in patients in the context of [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1745.72s)]
*  cardiac fibrosis and heart failure that's obviously going to be quite a landmark [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1751.48s)]
*  transformational moment for hire and we believe for the field in general truly making this biology [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1755.48s)]
*  tractable in the clinic but right behind our lead program we've deployed our platform in other [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1760.92s)]
*  fibrosis areas and we're actually advancing quite rapidly some of our novel targets in other areas [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1766.3600000000001s)]
*  like pulmonary fibrosis and like reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and the stroma in the [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1772.44s)]
*  context of solid tumors so really our priority at hire is to be clinical stage innovators [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1778.2s)]
*  demonstrate to the world in patients that this biology translates and then rapidly build up our [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1783.8s)]
*  pipeline to exploit this technology in this approach to hopefully bring truly disease modifying [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1790.52s)]
*  medicines to patients as fast as possible that's ultimately our goal let's get these medicines that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1796.76s)]
*  are truly disease modifying and accessible to patients as fast as possible clearly from what [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1802.28s)]
*  you're saying the sky's the limit in terms of the number of conditions and diseases that you can [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1808.2s)]
*  tackle with this absolutely think of all of those diseases caused by your environment [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1813.6399999999999s)]
*  where all of the common genetic variation is in the dark genome these are diseases and self-state [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1818.92s)]
*  transitions that are primed for a dark genome focused approach is there anything that you [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1824.76s)]
*  wanted to mention or cover that we haven't we've covered most of the bases it's an exciting time [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1829.8s)]
*  for the field and we're really excited at hire to keep driving and try to unlock the potential of [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1835.8799999999999s)]
*  the dark genome for medicines in areas where patients are in desperate need and that ultimately [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1841.56s)]
*  is our focus you know maybe one last thing i would just highlight is the great thing about [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1846.84s)]
*  this approach is we're using programmable genetic medicines and i think everybody's aware [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1852.12s)]
*  that once you have a target which is essentially a an rna target it's essentially digital [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1857.56s)]
*  information generating a programmable genetic medicine against that can happen very very fast [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1863.0s)]
*  so you can really start to think about accelerated timelines in terms of target discovery [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1868.84s)]
*  development candidate nomination glp talks and transitioning into clinic and that scenario we [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1874.04s)]
*  haven't touched on in today's discussion maybe in the future higher has deployed and built a lot of [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1879.72s)]
*  data science capabilities especially using statistical learning approaches machine learning [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1885.48s)]
*  to allow us to accelerate these steps so we're really imagining a future where we can accelerate [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1891.0s)]
*  target discovery and get assets candidates into patients on a much faster timeline than [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1896.92s)]
*  what we are imagining today that is the ultimate vision so we can go faster [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1903.16s)]
*  so if you didn't know before now you know what the dark genome is if it comes up in a quiz [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1907.16s)]
*  a really interesting subject and one we definitely haven't heard the last of [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1914.52s)]
*  don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at the biotech.eu [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7el15UILw60&t=1920.44s)]
