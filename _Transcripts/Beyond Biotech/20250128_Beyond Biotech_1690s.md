Video Description: Heidelberg Pharma is a clinical stage biotech company developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).


Its lead amanitin-based ADC product candidate, HDP-101, targets relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. HDP-101 recently received orphan drug designation; it is currently in a phase I/IIa clinical trial, demonstrating first signs of clinical efficacy. 

The company is also expanding its therapeutic product pipeline with a further four programs across a variety of malignant hematologic and solid tumors.


To tell us about how HDP-101 works, and what Heidelberg Pharma is doing in the space, we had a conversation with the company’s CEO, Prof. Andreas Pahl.

# How ADCs can deliver death cap mushroom toxins to treat cancer
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 100, a milestone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=16.28s)]
*  This week we're talking about mushrooms, well kind of. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=20.8s)]
*  Alpha-Amanitin is a new payload being investigated for antibody drug conjugates. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=24.64s)]
*  Although Alpha-Amanitin is a deadly poison produced by the death cap mushroom, it could [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=31.32s)]
*  be directed against cancer because of its potent cytotoxic properties. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=37.32s)]
*  To tell us all about antibody drug conjugates and how Alpha-Amanitin works, we had a conversation [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  with Heidelberg Farmer's CEO, Professor Andreas Pahl. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=49.92s)]
*  I wonder if first you could give me a bit of background on Heidelberg Farmer. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=56.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=60.08s)]
*  So Heidelberg Farmer was founded back in 1999 when Billingham Anheim was sold and was management [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=61.08s)]
*  bound. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=68.56s)]
*  So they pursued some old projects for some years, but that was not that successful. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=69.56s)]
*  And then Heidelberg Farmer reinvented itself more than 10 years ago by a PhD student who [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=77.0s)]
*  joined them as a PhD at the company and they took an idea from his old professor. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=83.52s)]
*  And basically this was the start of the story going to the ADC business. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=88.8s)]
*  So this was all around a new toxin and the ADC technology became famous at the first [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=92.72s)]
*  wave at that time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=99.24s)]
*  And the idea was to use that toxin as a new payload for antibody drug conjugates and to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=101.08s)]
*  make this then usable for cancer therapy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=106.52s)]
*  So that's basically the story. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=109.6s)]
*  And we developed this for a couple of years as a platform technology. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=111.8s)]
*  And then a few years later, so in 2016, we also started our own drug development based [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=115.92s)]
*  on the platform technology we developed so far. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  As we're going to be talking a bit about ADCs or antibody drug conjugates, I wonder if you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=125.8s)]
*  could explain a bit about what antibody drug conjugates are and payloads and how they work [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=130.44s)]
*  Yeah, usually we call it as the combination of the best of two worlds. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=137.44s)]
*  Everybody knows small molecules, the chemotherapeutics, which work very well in killing tumors, but [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=141.32s)]
*  they are not very specific because you know all these side effects are hair loss, mosaic [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  and you have a very hard time as a patient getting such a small molecule. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  So they are good, but they are very unspecific. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=158.04s)]
*  On the other end, you have the antibodies, which are highly specific in targeting certain [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  structures, but they don't have any pharmacological or cytotoxic activity on its own. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=165.48s)]
*  And the idea was to use the best of both worlds to conjugate them together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=171.68s)]
*  So I have a small chemical linker and use the high specificity of the antibodies to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=176.92s)]
*  deliver the toxic payload to the tumor cell. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=182.56s)]
*  So you can call it like a cruise missile. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=186.44s)]
*  So the antibody is the missile, let's say flying to the tumor cell, and then it's getting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=188.6s)]
*  uptaken by the tumor cell and delivering its payload to kill the tumor cell. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=194.4s)]
*  So that's the beauty of the ADCs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  And the belief is that you have a better therapeutic window because as compared to a traditional [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  chemotherapeutic agent, which is killing every cell, now you're delivering specifically the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=209.44s)]
*  toxic payload to the tumor cell and have a much better therapeutic window for the patient. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=214.8s)]
*  We're hearing a lot more, I think, about ADCs lately. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=221.36s)]
*  Why is it such a hot topic at the moment? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=224.52s)]
*  I believe it came in waves. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  So again, it was 15 years ago when there was a first wave with the approval of Katsaila [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=229.24s)]
*  and everybody was thinking, oh, that's now the golden nugget. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  But then it turned out to be not that easy as it looked like in the first instance. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=239.8s)]
*  So there were a lot of lessons learned, a little bit the value of death in between. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=245.48s)]
*  And then you had different payloads, which was also not optimal for ADCs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=251.66s)]
*  And a few years ago, the Ichizankyo came out with the Topo-1, the Topo-Isomers 1 inhibitors [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=257.28s)]
*  based on the X-T-KN, which is a very new class of toxic payloads. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=263.84s)]
*  And they delivered fantastic clinical data. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=269.28s)]
*  So a new wave of ADCs with fantastic clinical data. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=272.08s)]
*  You've seen a lot of deals. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=277.32s)]
*  And this was the next generation of ADCs, which was delivering good clinical data. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=278.84s)]
*  And people realized for solid tumors, so CAR T cells are very hot, bispecifics are very [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=286.4s)]
*  hot, but they are mainly working in hematological tumors. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=292.32s)]
*  They have not really brought into play for solid tumors. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  But solid tumors, there's much bigger population to target. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=301.48s)]
*  The market size is much bigger. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  So for solid tumors, the ADCs seems to be the hot modality. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=307.6s)]
*  And to have been to ESCO for a few weeks, now you see so many ADC talks for a variety [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=312.72s)]
*  of solid tumors and delivering good clinical data. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=317.92s)]
*  So this is really, let's say, in essence, why they are so hot for the current time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=321.72s)]
*  Right. Is that why there's been a lot of interest from Big Pharma? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  Sure. They are risk averse. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=332.4s)]
*  They are waiting until they get good clinical data so they don't go for a preclinical or phase one [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=333.88s)]
*  asset. But now they realize that it's working. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=340.2s)]
*  And you probably have seen the big money that EG is now getting from AZ, from Merck, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=343.12s)]
*  multi-billion dollar deals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  A lot of early stage companies are required. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=350.84s)]
*  So now Big Pharma is jumping on the train so they don't want to miss the train. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=354.0s)]
*  Now Big Pharma can afford, meanwhile, to say we are not in ADCs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=359.36s)]
*  So that's why it's really, let's say, getting so hot. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, seeing the potential. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  And if you look at ESCO, every Big Pharma has now ADCs in the pipeline and in particular [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=369.12s)]
*  for solid tumors. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=374.24s)]
*  Do you think that there will be more FDA approvals in the near future in the area? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=381.2s)]
*  You have seen the EDG programs coming. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=382.2s)]
*  A lot of follow up programs are coming. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=385.92s)]
*  We will see a flood of new ADCs. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=388.6s)]
*  Of course, what is also happening, so that's my personal view on this one, that are quite a lot of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=391.76s)]
*  ADCs coming, also a lot out of China. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=397.64s)]
*  So China is, let's say, producing in a highly proliferative way ADCs. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=400.44s)]
*  But the quality is maybe mixed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=406.48s)]
*  So there will be some failures in the clinical trials and not every ADC will be the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=408.12s)]
*  successor on its own. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=413.88s)]
*  So that's not true. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=415.2s)]
*  It's not like baking bread. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=416.64s)]
*  So there will be coming a lot of approvals, but not every ADC will be successful. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=418.16s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. What other ADC payloads are being used and what can they be used to treat? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=424.2s)]
*  The beauty of, in theory, of the ADCs is that just by selecting the antibody and the target [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=430.72s)]
*  for the antibody, you can address every tumor type. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=437.64s)]
*  And as an example from our payload, the amenitin, we have never found any tumor that was [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=441.4s)]
*  resistant to the amenitin. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=446.91999999999996s)]
*  So it's just the design of the ADC that you identify a suitable target, maybe for colorectal [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=448.36s)]
*  or varian or whatsoever, and then use your payload. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  And what is also seen in the space, there's a lot of follow up ADCs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=458.88s)]
*  So if an ADC on one target is approved, a dozen of companies jump on the same target [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=463.76s)]
*  with the same or different payloads. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=470.8s)]
*  There are a lot of follow up ADCs and not so much variety in the targets for using for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=472.96s)]
*  different tumors. So this is maybe a limitation. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=479.28s)]
*  And still, the variety of payloads is very limited, because if you look at the clinical [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=483.28s)]
*  trials, it's really dominated by either the tubulin inhibitors or the topoazromy 1 inhibitors. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=488.32s)]
*  Other payloads are really marginally. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=495.44s)]
*  And it's very clear that the field needs more payloads because if the tumor becomes [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=497.48s)]
*  resistant to one class of payload, you cannot treat with the same class of payload again [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=504.0s)]
*  because the tumor is resistant. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=510.6s)]
*  So you need to switch for different payloads in order to overcome the resistance of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=511.88s)]
*  patients. So there's a real, let's say, a do poll in the clinical trial setting. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=516.44s)]
*  Following on from that, when you are using ADCs, how do you avoid toxicity issues? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=522.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a challenge. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=529.36s)]
*  Despite what I have said, let's say you have a targeted delivery to the tumor cell. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=531.44s)]
*  It's not like mother's milk, or CBO call it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  You still have toxicities. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  And they're really, let's say, defined by the payload because if the payload kills the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=541.88s)]
*  tumor cell, it's released from the dying cells and it still needs to be eliminated from the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  body. So the tubulin inhibitors are, let's say, moving around in the bone marrow, killing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=551.88s)]
*  blood stem cells, doing, let's say, hemotoxicity for the topoazomyrase 1. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=557.84s)]
*  There's a similar, let's say, hemotoxicity, some kind of lung toxicity is observed. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=563.36s)]
*  So you cannot really completely get rid of this one. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=568.84s)]
*  And each payload class has a specific set of toxicities. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=572.16s)]
*  And you need to manage these toxicities. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=576.84s)]
*  You need to find ways in your ADC design to minimize. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=579.24s)]
*  But you can't not completely avoid these payload specific toxicities. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=582.8s)]
*  How important is the linker? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=588.4s)]
*  I get this question. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=590.8s)]
*  So I've been to the panel at ESCO. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=591.92s)]
*  This is quite a frequent question. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=593.64s)]
*  I have to say I'm biased coming from a payload company. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  So my view is a little bit negative on this one, because, again, in the end, the payload is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=598.36s)]
*  released from the tumor cell, whatever linker it was used for conjugation. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=604.24s)]
*  There are ideas around about, let's say, tumor specific release of the payload. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=609.24s)]
*  I haven't observed not so much advantages coming from this one. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=614.64s)]
*  So, again, I know there are linker companies that probably have a different view on this one. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=621.56s)]
*  My personal view, they are not the most important piece of the puzzle. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=626.16s)]
*  All right. What's alpha-ammoniton? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=631.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, alpha-ammoniton by nature is coming from a deadly mushroom. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's called in German, it's called the Grünknorlenblätterpitz. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=640.0s)]
*  In English, it's the green death cap mushroom. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=643.7199999999999s)]
*  And it's still the most common source of death after eating the wrong mushrooms. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=646.4799999999999s)]
*  It needs some skills to identify this one. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=652.68s)]
*  And quite, let's say, 30 to 50 percent of the people ingesting a sufficient amount of the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  mushrooms are dying from liver failure and subsequent organ failure. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=660.12s)]
*  So that's the ammoniton, that's the poison, the toxin of that green death cap mushroom. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  And the idea, of course, in nature, he wants to avoid to be eaten by small animals. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=669.68s)]
*  And it has a very unique mode of action. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=675.2399999999999s)]
*  So it has been used in cell biology for years because it's a specific inhibitor of eukaryotic [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=677.56s)]
*  transcription. And the beauty for us, it's the only compound known in the world in the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=684.08s)]
*  world with that mode of action. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  And since the eukaryotic transcription is also very important to tumor cells. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  So if you deliver the ammoniton to tumor cells, you immediately drive them into cell death and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  you destroy the tumor cell. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=703.64s)]
*  So this was the idea in the beginning. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=705.84s)]
*  But the ammoniton itself is too toxic. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  So it was never used as a single agent, as a small molecule. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=711.0s)]
*  And the idea, how I call it, was to harness the ADC technology and build the ADC technology [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=715.44s)]
*  around the ammoniton and then make cancer drugs out of this one. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=721.64s)]
*  How are you able to make such a deadly toxin useful and not remain toxic? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  Again, with the ADC, we detoxified the ammoniton. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's really that the tumor specific delivery. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=736.24s)]
*  And it turned out that finally you need only a rather small amount of the ammoniton or a [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=741.08s)]
*  very small amount of the ammoniton to kill the tumor cell. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=748.24s)]
*  So to give you an idea, let's say if we give our ADC to the patient and the ammoniton would [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=752.24s)]
*  drop off the antibody within a second in this patient, the ammoniton dose is still too low [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=759.4s)]
*  to kill that human being. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=766.48s)]
*  So we are far below the mushroom toxic dose, because when people were coming to the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  hospital, you could, let's say, back calculate the amount of mushroom they have ingested [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  and how much ammoniton was. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=779.0s)]
*  So it's very much known that, let's say you have 0.1 milligram per kilogram is the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  50 for man for the ammoniton. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=785.88s)]
*  And we need a much lower dose for killing tumor cells because we are so specific by [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=788.16s)]
*  using our technology, conjugating this to the antibody. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  And again, a very low amount of the ammoniton is needed when it is delivered to the tumor [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  cell to kill the cell. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=801.64s)]
*  So that's the final trick. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=803.52s)]
*  So the secret sauce of Heidelberg Pharma. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  And what kind of tumors are you using it for? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=808.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we have developed our pipeline. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=812.32s)]
*  Again, we can address in theory every tumor type. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=814.32s)]
*  Our first program, we decided years ago to target multiple myeloma where we are already [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=818.0s)]
*  in phase one in multiple myeloma patients. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=823.48s)]
*  The next program will be targeting B cell leukemias and lymphomas. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=827.0s)]
*  And then we are going for the solid tumors for prostate and colorectal cancer. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=832.6400000000001s)]
*  So that's the pipeline we are building up with the first four projects. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=837.7600000000001s)]
*  But we also partnering our programs and look for other companies using different antibodies [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=842.2s)]
*  to really maximize the commercial success of the platform as well. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=846.64s)]
*  Makes me think when a toxin is being used to treat something, how is that connection [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=851.0s)]
*  initially made between here we have a deadly mushroom and we have a disease? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=857.56s)]
*  How do you make that connection? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=863.72s)]
*  The connection finally is that for every tumor disease, you need to find a marker, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=865.88s)]
*  a target on these tumor cells. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=872.8399999999999s)]
*  And these are very different for each tumor type. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=875.52s)]
*  There are only a few, let's say, which are the cross solid tumors. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=878.52s)]
*  And for example, for the multiple myeloma, because the myeloma comes from plasma cells [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=882.16s)]
*  which are the bone marrow and was known that there's a molecular marker on these plasma [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=889.28s)]
*  cells. And then people found out in research years ago that there's a specific marker on [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=894.36s)]
*  the myeloma cells. And this is finding the connection. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=900.96s)]
*  And this marker is different if you go to a hot skin lymphoma is different for prostate [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=904.24s)]
*  cancer. So for that specific question, I believe the answer is that you need to identify [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=910.08s)]
*  a molecular marker on the surface of these tumor cells, which makes the connection. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=916.72s)]
*  And then it's all about biochemistry, finding the antibody for that marker. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=922.32s)]
*  So this is biochemical and molecular biology, biological methods, which basically do the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=926.44s)]
*  trick. But the link to answer your question is the specific tumor marker, let's say. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=933.5200000000001s)]
*  And this is one of the challenges. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=940.12s)]
*  There is hardly any ideal tumor marker because every marker is to some extent expressed on [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=941.7600000000001s)]
*  healthy cells. So you need to find a huge expression, a higher expression on tumor cells [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=947.88s)]
*  and whatsoever. It's also partly explaining the toxicity of the adecine. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  In practical terms, how is the imanitin delivered and how does it work in the body? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=959.0s)]
*  Now, finally, the adecine is, let's say, given intravenously, not to say we have a lot of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=965.2s)]
*  developing the subcutaneous delivery, but the standard delivery is the intravenous. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  It's then circulating in the bloodstream in terms of a hematological tumor. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=977.24s)]
*  It's very easy. Let's say the adc looks again, the antibody looks for the target [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=982.0400000000001s)]
*  structure on the cancer cells for solid tumors. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=986.2s)]
*  The adc needs to diffuse out of the circulation and to find the tumor. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=990.6800000000001s)]
*  And then as soon as the antibody recognizes the structure on the surface of the tumor [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=996.64s)]
*  cells, it binds to the structure. And then there is, let's say, a cellular mechanism, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1001.7199999999999s)]
*  which is called endocytosis. So as soon as the antibody binds to the target [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  on the surface of the tumor cells, it's a process called endocytosis. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1012.5999999999999s)]
*  So it's, let's say, the membrane engulfed. So there's a small, let's say, hole in the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1017.7199999999999s)]
*  membrane. And then this hole, let's say, is cut off of the membrane and a new structure, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1023.0799999999999s)]
*  which is called a vesicle, is then endocytosed from the surface of the tumor cells. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1029.76s)]
*  And then there's a cellular process where the content of this endocytosed [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1035.88s)]
*  antibody or adc target and again is destroyed in these endolysis. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1042.08s)]
*  Somehow they are called and then finally the toxic payload is released because the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1049.08s)]
*  structure is then also disassembled in the inside of the cell. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1054.04s)]
*  As far as the delivery is concerned, you mentioned that it's intravenous. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1058.12s)]
*  How often does it have to be given and is it something that works as a monotherapy [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1062.2399999999998s)]
*  or is it in conjunction with other treatments? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1067.84s)]
*  There's been a little bit of tradition. The field, let's say, is given every three [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1070.4799999999998s)]
*  weeks. But there are, let's say, changes to this called standard regimen because [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1075.8s)]
*  there's a certain half life to each biological drug and also other drugs on the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1081.88s)]
*  market which are given in the weekly cycle or given for two weeks and then the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1087.2s)]
*  pause of one week. So this is finally the art of clinical development. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  What is the best way to maintain the efficacy of the drug but to avoid the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  toxicity as its best? The third answer is every two, every three weeks, maybe every [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  four weeks is given intravenously. But there are different regimens. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1107.2s)]
*  I was regard to a frequency where they have more frequent but then at a lower [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1110.96s)]
*  dose. And usually in the phase one trial, it's given as a monotherapy most of the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  time because you want to understand your drug, the toxicities and the efficacy. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1120.6s)]
*  And if you give it in combination, it's challenging to dissect what is the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1126.28s)]
*  contribution of your new drug to the efficacy and safety. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1131.32s)]
*  But as soon as you have a safe dose, companies are thinking about [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  combination therapy. So still, ADCs are given in monotherapy. But as it's known [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  from the world of chemotherapeutics, combination is still the key or standard [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1146.52s)]
*  regimens, let's say in cancer, combination treatments. And this is very specific and [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1151.8799999999999s)]
*  very individual for each ADC, for each tumor type, to look in the best form of [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1157.08s)]
*  treatment regimen for this ADC. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  Could you tell me a bit about the clinical trials that you're doing, where [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1167.36s)]
*  you're at with those? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1170.56s)]
*  Yes, mentioned the STP 101, how we call our first program, multiple myeloma. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1171.92s)]
*  We have known the first five cohorts passed. The first four cohorts, they [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1176.36s)]
*  mainly say you need to start with a rather low dose. We haven't seen so much [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1181.08s)]
*  in the first four cohorts. No safety signals, no efficacy, but one. So we had [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1186.68s)]
*  one patient in the third cohort, which went on a stable disease. So you need to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1193.16s)]
*  think of these patient population and stage patients because they are passing [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1198.88s)]
*  all lines of known therapy. And sooner or later, they have become resistant to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1203.72s)]
*  everything which is on the market. And then this is the population we see with [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1209.72s)]
*  our drug. And again, if you then with the monotherapy of our drug, we see a [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1214.2s)]
*  patient in a stable disease. So he's not, let's say, progressing in his tumor [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1219.08s)]
*  disease for more than a year. Let's say just this was the first very good [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1224.12s)]
*  success of our drug because you need these patients have only weeks or months [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1229.36s)]
*  to survive. So this was the first hint of efficacy. And then with the fifth [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1233.08s)]
*  cohort, we have seen much more. So it's typically you'd escalate and you see [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1239.48s)]
*  then sometimes top efficacy coming. And there they were very, very pleased to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1244.12s)]
*  see that three out of five patients, which has been repeatedly dosed with our [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1250.1599999999999s)]
*  drug at the dose of the fifth cohort, we have seen objective responses and [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1255.56s)]
*  objective responses are defined by a certain reduction of tumor cells in these [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1260.04s)]
*  tumor types. And we have seen partial remissions and partial remissions in [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1266.4399999999998s)]
*  these three out of five patients defined by international standards if you have [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1270.88s)]
*  more than 50 percent reduction in the tumor cells. So we were very pleased to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1275.68s)]
*  see that in these three out of five patients, we have seen more than 50 [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1280.68s)]
*  percent reduction of the myeloma cells and with a very easily manageable safety [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1284.16s)]
*  profile. So we are also optimizing on the treatment regimen, which would then [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1289.96s)]
*  allow us to dose further higher so that we really see a little bit more room for [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1296.24s)]
*  escalating the dose to even improve the efficacy and the duration of response of [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1302.24s)]
*  these patients. But I believe in our view, it's the really clinical proof of [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1307.4s)]
*  concept that this new payload or a new toxin is working in the patients with a [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1313.16s)]
*  very good safety profile and which is also very different from others and which [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1318.64s)]
*  can overcome resistance. So these patients we are seeing have seen five, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1323.16s)]
*  nine, even 15 prior lines of therapy and they are still responding to our drug, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1328.0400000000002s)]
*  which is a huge success for us. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1333.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's excellent. And you also recently received orphan prog designation [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1336.0s)]
*  for HDP 101. What are the next steps there? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  Correct. So we were very pleased to see this. And the idea for us is, let's say, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1345.0800000000002s)]
*  by the end of the year that we have reached the end of the phase one and then [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1349.32s)]
*  we start the phase two H, as it's called, so that the dose we identified then to be [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1355.24s)]
*  safe for the patient to roll out to a higher number of patients and to have a [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1360.8s)]
*  more robust efficacy signal in these patients. And then we have also a new [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1366.8s)]
*  biomarker for our payload where we can identify high-risk patients, which will, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1372.2s)]
*  let's say, very likely to respond to our drug, which have a very poor prognosis. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1377.88s)]
*  And with such a setting, you, let's say, may go to the FDA to ask for an [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1384.2800000000002s)]
*  accelerated approval. So the idea, again, with this phase two A part and to turn [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1389.16s)]
*  these patient calls then to enrich the patients and turn this into a [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1395.4s)]
*  registration call and then to seek accelerated approval for this drug to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1399.88s)]
*  really speed up the development for the first market product based on our [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1405.6s)]
*  technology. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1410.1999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any timelines on that yet when you expect or hope to be able to? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1411.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is always very challenging. Again, so we will start with the phase [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1416.8799999999999s)]
*  two A part next year. And then it's a little bit the length of recruitment and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1421.4399999999998s)]
*  the discussions with the FDA, whether this will take, let's say, three, four [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1426.28s)]
*  or five years is a little bit difficult to predict. And obviously, my [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1431.3999999999999s)]
*  department, myeloma is a huge market and we are, let's say, a relatively small [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1436.56s)]
*  company. Sooner or later, we will probably seek for pharma partners who [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1440.6399999999999s)]
*  can join that enterprise because that's probably not on us then to market and [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1445.76s)]
*  sell this drug to the myeloma patients. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1451.8s)]
*  As far as ADC payloads goes, where do you think that that field is headed in [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1454.68s)]
*  the near future? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1461.2s)]
*  I believe now we see the peak of the top one inhibitors because in my feeling, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1463.36s)]
*  every known target has now an ADC program with the top one on it. So this [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1469.04s)]
*  field is then the top ones has passed the peak. And the field is looking for [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1474.24s)]
*  new toxins with new mode of actions where we believe fit very well in this [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1479.96s)]
*  one. And what we observe for other companies for big pharma, they are [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1485.72s)]
*  really looking, scouting for new payloads with new mode of actions. But [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1490.52s)]
*  even from our own experience, I have to say it's quite an enterprise to get a [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1495.52s)]
*  new toxin to work because every payload is different, has different physical [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1500.16s)]
*  chemical properties, different mode of action. You need to learn about the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1504.64s)]
*  toxicities, the best ADC design. So there will be huge effort now is ongoing [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1508.6s)]
*  for these new payloads. And it's very hard to predict which will be the new [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1515.9199999999998s)]
*  star of the show. So again, we hope that a manatee will be one of the new stars. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  So that's that's where I would say our goal we are we are working very hard. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1528.04s)]
*  Probably others will come up soon with different modes of action. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1532.52s)]
*  You mentioned that kind of complexity are things like machine learning and [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1536.44s)]
*  artificial intelligence. Are they making a difference? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1540.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is the buzzword of the year, of course. I believe what AI needs is [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1544.12s)]
*  needs a huge database. And since there are hardly any successful payloads, so [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1551.56s)]
*  let's say if you have 2 million and a percent double ones, so I believe the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  even AI cannot say with a very small database can generate something new. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1561.44s)]
*  It's let's say maybe for identifying new targets, I see more room for this one to [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1566.72s)]
*  identify the best properties of the target to look into patients and the [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1572.72s)]
*  clinical data. So there I see more room for the AI for new payloads. Again, I [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1576.48s)]
*  believe the amount of available payloads which needs to be fed into these AI [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1583.96s)]
*  programs for the learning machine learning is much too small to generate [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1590.12s)]
*  new ones. But again, maybe there are surprises. I don't know. But this is my [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1594.3999999999999s)]
*  view on that. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1599.84s)]
*  Is there anything else that you wanted to mention that we didn't talk about? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1601.1599999999999s)]
*  I believe a very, very good set of questions. Again, coming back from ESCO, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1605.08s)]
*  there's a huge wave of ADCs coming. Concern is a little bit that the quality [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1609.76s)]
*  is very, very different, but there will be a huge variety of new options, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1614.56s)]
*  especially for solo tumors for patients, especially tumors like pancreatic, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1620.52s)]
*  colorectal, which there are not so many options for the patients. So I believe [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1625.36s)]
*  the ADCs will deliver very much in the future. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1630.56s)]
*  It's interesting how toxic compounds might be great tools against disease if [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1634.2s)]
*  used in a certain way. There are plenty of plants or parts of plants that are [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1640.04s)]
*  poisonous unless they're cooked, or only certain parts are edible. So clearly [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1644.92s)]
*  lots of opportunities to investigate how toxic compounds might be useful in [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1649.4s)]
*  disease treatment. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles on [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-i2m37TeRQ&t=1655.32s)]
