Video Description: Acute on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a significant healthcare issue with high unmet needs for patients and clinicians, and a massive burden for healthcare systems. It cost more than $6bn in the US alone in 2021, with a drastic increase over the last 10 years. 


Genfit is a late-stage biopharma company taking on rare, life-threatening liver diseases with a range of therapeutic targets based on pathophysiology. The company has five assets in its portfolio, from preclinical up to phase 2.


Its ACLF portfolio includes five assets under development: VS-01, NTZ, SRT-015, CLM-022 and VS-02-HE, based on complementary mechanisms of action using different routes of administration. Other assets target other diseases, such as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), urea cycle disorder (UCD) and organic acidemia (OA). 


Genfit carried out a successful 52-week phase 3 ELATIVE study evaluating elafibranor in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). 


It also has a diagnostic franchise including NIS2+ in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as NASH or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) and TS-01 focusing on blood ammonia levels.


On the podcast this week to talk to us about the latest in liver disease treatment is Dean Hum, the chief scientific officer at Genfit.

# How biotechs are revolutionizing acute on-chronic liver failure?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 103. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. This week we're talking about finding new treatments for rare [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=16.52s)]
*  liver diseases. Genfit is a biopharma company looking to find new and effective treatments [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=24.12s)]
*  for a variety of diseases including acute on chronic liver failure. To talk to us about the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  latest in liver disease treatment is Dean Humm, the Chief Scientific Officer at Genfit. Okay, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=38.64s)]
*  so I guess to get things started I wonder if you could tell me about the origins and a bit [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=46.74s)]
*  of the history of Genfit. Sure, thank you Jim for the invitation. Great to meet you and have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=51.52s)]
*  this conversation. So Genfit was founded in 1999 and the founding CEO was Jean-Francois Mounet and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  the scientific co-founder is Bart Stiles. And so when we started the company there was a two-prong [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=66.12s)]
*  approach. We had different programs which we had in place with different pharmaceutical companies [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=73.28s)]
*  and these were large programs where they would typically pay for upwards of five or six FTEs and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=80.96s)]
*  we had these programs renewed several times. So they would commit for like four or five years and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  then we had these renewed. And typically what we were doing for these pharmaceutical companies [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=94.16s)]
*  at that time was to help them in their drug discovery programs and where Genfit was involved [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  in identifying therapeutic targets and then validating the therapeutic targets which were [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=105.28s)]
*  then screened by the pharmaceutical companies with their chemical libraries. The other second [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=112.08s)]
*  part that was ongoing at the beginning of the company was to also have in place our own drug [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=118.52s)]
*  discovery program Jim. And so this is with our own medicinal chemists and we would develop or [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  discover and identify different compounds and at that time our focus was on nuclear receptors. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=130.72s)]
*  Bart Stiles who is the scientific co-founder is actually one of the pioneers in the whole nuclear [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=138.11999999999998s)]
*  receptor space and in particular PPARs. And I mentioned PPARs because L-Fibonor as you probably [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=144.16s)]
*  heard about it is a dual PPAR agonist and this is a molecule which is discovered from our medicinal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=150.88s)]
*  chemistry within Genfit and then of course Genfit took the L-Fibonor program all the way from [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=158.6s)]
*  discovery all the way to phase three in MASH as well as in PBC. But just to finish the story on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=164.32s)]
*  the progress and the evolution of Genfit over time we stopped the part where we were involved [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  in research for some pharmaceutical companies and we then focused exclusively on our own discovery [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  pipeline. So with L-Fibonor we went into MASH as well as in PBC. In MASH we brought it all the way [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=184.12s)]
*  to the end of our phase three which ultimately did not meet its primary endpoint but in PBC we [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=191.68s)]
*  had very nice data in our phase 2b trial and then we started the phase three trial in BBC and it was [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=197.16s)]
*  during the phase three that we partnered our program with L-Fibonor with Ibsen and so in that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=205.68s)]
*  collaboration or partnership with Ibsen together we brought the program all the way to the end phase [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=212.44s)]
*  three which then ultimately went which is now approved in the US. Throughout that whole process [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=218.16s)]
*  Jim I think what Genfit has gained is a lot of know-how a lot of expertise first in drug [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=224.56s)]
*  discovery and also the development team was able to bring the program with L-Fibonor all the way [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=231.2s)]
*  to the end so we've gained a lot of expertise. We also gained a lot of expertise in liver diseases [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=237.64s)]
*  and so with that expertise of being able to be involved in a liver disease at the very beginning [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=244.32s)]
*  when it was an emerging disease space which is what MASH was when we got involved we also gained [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  that expertise to work with regulatory agencies, engage with KOLs and really be involved during [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  the emerging phase of an indication or disease area and then be a leader to drive the whole field [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=263.56s)]
*  forward and so when we decided not to continue our program in developing therapies in MASH what we [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=270.32s)]
*  had decided was to stay in the liver disease space and then we were looking for a disease liver [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=278.56s)]
*  disease area which was more acute more severe and a disease area where we can read out on clinical [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=284.4s)]
*  endpoints much quicker and this is how we came upon ACLF or acute and chronic liver failure and so [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  with the proceeds that we received from MIDSIM we were able to build a pipeline in ACLF and this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=299.24s)]
*  is what we are executing on right now. All right so if we switch to ACLF I wonder if you could give [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=306.56s)]
*  me a bit of background on what acute on chronic liver failure actually is. ACLF is I would say [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=314.32s)]
*  sort of like an end-stage clinical condition of many if not all chronic liver diseases when I see [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=322.4s)]
*  chronic liver diseases these includes things like MASH, viral hepatitis, alcohol related to liver [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=329.64s)]
*  disease and so on and as you know Jim all these liver diseases over time when they progress this [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=336.6s)]
*  leads to fibrosis the fibrosis as it gets worse leads to cirrhosis so you would first have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=343.28s)]
*  compensated cirrhosis where the liver is functioning fine and the patients do relatively [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  well then when that worsens and progresses you get into decompensated cirrhosis okay and this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  is where the liver starts to lose its function and acute on chronic liver failure is when patients [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=363.55999999999995s)]
*  have acutely decompensated cirrhosis which is then when these patients have a precipitating [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  event and when we say precipitating event this could be an alcohol binge for example it could [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=379.44s)]
*  be viral hepatitis being reactivated it could also be drug-induced liver toxicity where these [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  patients then get into what we call ACLF and ACLF is really patients with acute decompensated [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=391.44000000000005s)]
*  cirrhosis which then have a precipitating event which then leads to multiple organ failures and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=399.88s)]
*  this is really this multiple organ failure part which is important and so that's what it is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  patients with acute decompensated cirrhosis associated with multiple organ failures and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=412.56s)]
*  what's the prognosis like for those that have ACLF so this is a very severe clinical condition [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=419.44s)]
*  Jim patients with ACLF they are categorized according to how many liver failures they have [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=426.88s)]
*  so ACLF zero is basically patients who do not have the ACLF no organ failures ACLF one is when [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=434.32s)]
*  the patient has one organ failure and then you have ACLF two and three two two organ failures [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=441.88s)]
*  three three organ failures and so on so when patients have ACLF one one organ failure the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=448.44s)]
*  survival or the mortality rate of patients is already about 25% okay so you this right away you [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  realize this is a very severe clinical condition and typically in clinical trials we talk about [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=462.72s)]
*  28-day survival so patients with ACLF one has a 28-day survival mortality rate of about 25% just [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  to give you an idea how this is a progressive with increasing numbers of organ failure patients with [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=479.68s)]
*  ACLF three three organ failures they have a 28-day mortality rate of anywhere between 75 to 80% [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=485.2s)]
*  so this really speaks to the severe state of patients with ACLF which then of course raises [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=492.56s)]
*  the point that we really need a new therapies to be able to manage these patients and to avoid [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  the high mortality rate are there any current treatments right now there is no specific treatment [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  that is approved for the treatment of patients with ACLF or to treat the ACLF which is why you [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=514.64s)]
*  know this is a very high unmet space and which is why GenFit is so engaged to really find therapies [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=521.28s)]
*  and therapeutic solutions for these patients and could you tell me what EF Cliff is so EF Cliff is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=529.52s)]
*  the European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure so this is a consortium which has [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=538.16s)]
*  done a lot of work in ACLF they have done a lot of seminal work in ACLF the current definition [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=545.36s)]
*  which we are using in our clinical trials and many if not all clinical trials use this definition [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=552.68s)]
*  of ACLF many if not all clinical trials use the definition of ACLF which is defined by EF Cliff [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=558.76s)]
*  so EF Cliff is a consortium of different investigators international investigators who [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=569.4s)]
*  are involved in the understanding of ACLF as well as thinking of therapeutic solutions as well as [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  diagnosis of the ACLF and so on a seminal publication coming from EF Cliff one is the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=584.48s)]
*  canonic it's an observational prospective clinical trial which characterizes ACLF patients and I [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=591.16s)]
*  think another important publication coming from the EF Cliff is the PREDICT trial and both of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=598.76s)]
*  these are published and I would invite the listeners to go and if there's any interest [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  into those publications. All right and there was the General Assembly that took place recently [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=610.48s)]
*  what were you at that and are you able to kind of explain what happens at the assembly? Sure sure [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=616.56s)]
*  so I was at that assembly and the reason why I was there is because GenFit has partnered with EF [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=624.4s)]
*  Cliff and it's important for GenFit to work with the best groups in ACLF EF Cliff is one such [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=630.88s)]
*  organization and there are other organizations out there but which we are presently engaging with in [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  different areas of the world as well we are also engaging with different experts in this disease [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=645.4s)]
*  area so the General Assembly of EF Cliff really provided an overview of the accomplishments of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=651.8s)]
*  EF Cliff during the last year well first of all they highlighted the new governance organization [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=660.28s)]
*  of EF Cliff bringing forward and communicating that Richard Moreau is the new director of EF Cliff [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=668.0s)]
*  there was also mention of GenFit as a new partner of EF Cliff and then they went through different [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=674.64s)]
*  programs which EF Cliff is involved with for example they are involved in translational research [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=681.16s)]
*  so as Joanne Clare presented an overview of what they have been working on in that space and they [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=687.56s)]
*  also highlighted different trials which are ongoing in ACLF and of course our phase two trial [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=693.84s)]
*  unveil it with via 01 was also mentioned in that General Assembly importantly they highlighted some [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=700.88s)]
*  interim results from the CHANCE trials the CHANCE trial is a trial that's sponsored by EF Cliff which [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=709.0s)]
*  is looking at any potential benefits of liver transplant in patients with ACLF 2 & 3 and so [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=716.76s)]
*  the interim analysis demonstrated that there is for sure a benefit for ACLF 2 & ACLF 3 patients [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=723.82s)]
*  to be transplanted and there was also poster and oral presentation on that during the ESL conference [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  and then last but not least of course you know EF Cliff is involved in cutting-edge research and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=738.74s)]
*  they're always thinking about you know what are the big remaining questions in ACLF as well as in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=744.74s)]
*  and so they also spoke to potential new trials which they would like to get off the ground so [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=751.66s)]
*  really a global overview of the undertakings of EF Cliff. Could you tell me a bit about Ipsen's [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=757.5s)]
*  work with LF5RENOR for PBC and the target PDUFA date on June the 10th? We partnered with Ipsen when [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=763.3s)]
*  the phase three trial was ongoing so together with Ipsen we completed the phase three trial. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=771.74s)]
*  Right now Ipsen is involved and responsible actually for any remaining studies with LF5RENOR [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=778.5s)]
*  and Ipsen is really taking that on and they're doing a great job there. Ipsen also did a lot [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=786.82s)]
*  of the heavy lifting once the phase three trial was completed and getting the whole dossier ready [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=793.7s)]
*  for the PDUFA date and for regulatory approval with the FDA and so they did a great job there [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=800.06s)]
*  and I think in terms of timelines they were really professional and quick about it which is no [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=807.42s)]
*  surprise I mean we decided to partner with Ipsen because we knew they were a strong partner. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=812.54s)]
*  We knew that they were going to be committed in the liver disease space and so they really [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=817.5s)]
*  shined and showed their capabilities as they got the dossier ready for regulatory approval. So [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=823.02s)]
*  the PDUFA date was June 10th which of course went very well and which led to the approval of LF5RENOR [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=828.86s)]
*  in the states for the treatment of patients with FDPC. That's very good news yeah. Why do you think [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=837.26s)]
*  there's been so little work on ACLF? ACLF has very high unmet need. This is a relatively new space [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=843.9s)]
*  Jim. I would say today ACLF is where MASH was about 10-15 years ago. So remember when [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=852.86s)]
*  Genfit got involved in MASH this was like 10-15 years ago and at that time MASH was also an [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=861.1800000000001s)]
*  emerging space and so Genfit got involved very early and we were able to move that space forward [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=869.1s)]
*  and remain amongst the leaders. Now ACLF today is in a very similar spot just to give you an idea. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=875.34s)]
*  The EF-CLIF definition of ACLF that was provided in 2013 which is relatively recent and since then [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=882.9399999999999s)]
*  there has been building awareness and building interest in ACLF. So I would say right now ACLF [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=892.78s)]
*  is an emerging space just to give you an idea Jim. In the previous two or three years when we [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=899.5s)]
*  went to the ESL meeting or the ASLD meetings there was few mention of ACLF but I can tell you that [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=904.78s)]
*  last year as well as this year at the ASLD last year and then the current year right now [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=910.94s)]
*  we just came back from the ESL meeting a month ago and there's really heightened interest in [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=916.5400000000001s)]
*  ACLF and this is really highlighted by the number of abstracts as well as the high participation rates. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=922.3800000000001s)]
*  When you go into presentations, oral presentations concerning ACLF EF-CLIF also provided quite a few [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=929.6600000000001s)]
*  presentations on their programs and I can tell you that there was a lot of attendance [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=936.78s)]
*  at those different presentations. So an emerging space, building interest of course and I think [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=942.3s)]
*  right now Genfit is in the driver's seat with our pipeline of programs and hopefully provide clinical [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=949.18s)]
*  benefits with our therapeutic approaches that we are developing. Are there other companies or [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=956.22s)]
*  research taking place in the area right now? Yeah there are different companies and different [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=962.7s)]
*  programs which are involved. One that comes to mind is Griffles which is doing a lot of work [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=968.62s)]
*  to look at the potential benefit that treatment with albumin may have on ACLF patients and then [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=975.18s)]
*  there's also a program targeting the TLR4 within TLR4 antagonist and also treating with GCSF. So [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=981.74s)]
*  yeah those are the programs which come to mind. So Genfit is not alone in this space, there is [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=991.5s)]
*  building interest but as I mentioned before I think right now we are the only company with such a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=997.9s)]
*  comprehensive pipeline of programs. What's been your approach to developing treatments for ACLF? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1003.8199999999999s)]
*  What we decided to do Jim was really to take a hard look at the pathophysiology of patients [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1012.86s)]
*  with ACLF and when we did that there are different areas which we felt was important to address when [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1019.82s)]
*  you think about any therapeutic approach. There's several of them. One important one is systemic [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1028.3s)]
*  inflammation. We know that patients with ACLF have a heightened activation of the systemic [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1034.54s)]
*  inflammation so targeting systemic inflammation we felt was an important area. Another important [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1041.5s)]
*  aspect of patients with ACLF, remember I mentioned multiple organ failures and associated with the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1048.3s)]
*  multiple organ failures is increased cell death, programmed cell death, necroptosis. Importantly [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1055.6599999999999s)]
*  there's also pro-inflammatory cell death so really we felt and we still would believe that targeting [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1064.1399999999999s)]
*  cell death is also an important area and then the third area which we wanted to target which we are [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1070.86s)]
*  targeting is the microbiota. Like many chronic liver diseases dysbiosis is an important aspect [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1076.14s)]
*  and then this is no different with patients with ACLF and many of the experts will always point out [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  that the microbiota or targeting the microbiota is an important aspect for the treatment of [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1089.8200000000002s)]
*  liver diseases and in particular ACLF. So these are the three areas which we were focusing on [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1097.18s)]
*  and we decided to really build a pipeline of different approaches taking these three areas [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1103.34s)]
*  into account and what was important for us Jim while we wanted to build a pipeline with multiple [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1109.02s)]
*  assets is because of course we want several shots on the goal but also keep in mind that ACLF is a [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1115.26s)]
*  multifactorial disease and so like all multifactorial clinical conditions these are best managed [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1122.62s)]
*  clinically with combination therapies and combination of different approaches which [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1130.86s)]
*  address different pathways different aspects of the clinical condition so we believe that ACLF [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1136.06s)]
*  will also be best managed clinically with combination therapy so when we thought about [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1142.4599999999998s)]
*  building the pipeline what we decided to do was also to bring in assets with different mechanisms [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1148.3s)]
*  of action but complementary mechanisms of action because we want to have this ability [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1155.1s)]
*  for combination therapy as we move forward. Can you give me a little bit of detail on how some [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1161.6599999999999s)]
*  of those assets work at that biological level? Of course as it stands today we have five programs [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1168.3s)]
*  which are positioned for the treatment of patients with ACLF the most advanced program [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1176.2199999999998s)]
*  and we are currently running a phase two trial to provide proof of concept and the most advanced [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1182.54s)]
*  program involves liposomes so this is a technology the name of the program is VIA-01 and the clinical [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1187.82s)]
*  trial that is ongoing is called Unveilit and so the technology is that it's a liposome and this [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1195.5s)]
*  is an engineered liposome where we infuse this into the intraperitoneal space so remember patients [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1202.22s)]
*  many majority of patients with ACLF will have ascites fluid and so the standard of care for [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1208.38s)]
*  many of these patients is to insert a catheter drain away at the ascites fluid. The approach [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1215.66s)]
*  with VIA-01 is to use that same catheter infuse the liposomes into the intraperitoneal space and [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1221.98s)]
*  what these liposomes will do is because they are engineered to have an acidic core they will [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1228.6200000000001s)]
*  take up ammonia which is a toxin which is by leading to decline of the patients and the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1235.5800000000002s)]
*  fact that it has an acidic core would trap the ammonia in the liposome. The liposomes will also [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1241.66s)]
*  be able to take up toxins for example so the idea is that these liposomes would absorb these toxins [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1247.1000000000001s)]
*  and when you drain the fluid back out you will be able to remove the toxins so the protocol the phase [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1254.8600000000001s)]
*  two protocols we do this once a day for four days in a row and we're looking at efficacy and safety [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1260.54s)]
*  throughout the trial and the first look is after seven days. The other program that we have ongoing [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1268.46s)]
*  is with a small molecule called nettozozanide or NTZ so NTZ is a molecule which has multiple [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1273.82s)]
*  activities the important activities is it has an antibacterial activity is anti-inflammatory [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1280.62s)]
*  it also impacts on cell death and so this is a program which we have an [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1287.1s)]
*  extensive comprehensive pre-clinical program speaking to the efficacy the potential benefits [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1293.26s)]
*  in different models and these include models of inflammation as well as in aclf models so this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1299.6599999999999s)]
*  program is now a clinical stage in a sense that it is ready for a phase two proof of concept [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1306.2199999999998s)]
*  and so what we have decided to do is to reformulate NTZ which was provide us the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1314.46s)]
*  opportunity to test multiple doses and we will be looking to go into the clinic with a phase two [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1320.9399999999998s)]
*  trial the first half of next year. The third program I mentioned is a program called SRT015 [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1327.1799999999998s)]
*  this is a molecule which inhibits a target called ASK1 so ASK1 is something that is activated by [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1334.54s)]
*  oxidative stress which then leads to increased inflammation cell death as well as fibrosis and [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1342.3s)]
*  so this is a molecule which we license from seal rock so seal rock is going to move forward [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1349.5s)]
*  with this molecule for the treatment of patients with mash but genfit has in licensed this molecule [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1355.34s)]
*  and what we are going to do is to formulate an injectable form of this molecule and then [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1362.06s)]
*  test it in patients with aclf. Right now the team is working to provide preclinical proof of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1368.6999999999998s)]
*  concept and then we're also looking to bring this into the clinic for a proof of concept trial [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1375.8999999999999s)]
*  in the first half of next year. The next program I mentioned is a small molecule that targets the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1381.7399999999998s)]
*  NLRP3 in plamazone as you may know activation of the NLRP3 in plamazone leads to increased [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1387.34s)]
*  inflammation but it also leads to increased cell death something we call pyroptosis and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1396.62s)]
*  pyroptosis is a pro and inflammatory cell death and so this we feel is a very important mechanism [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1402.3799999999999s)]
*  for the treatment of patients with aclf so again we're looking to provide preclinical proof of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1408.9399999999998s)]
*  concept and then we'll move towards a clinical proof of concept well first phase one and then [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1415.7399999999998s)]
*  phase two as we move forward. The last program I'll mention is a small molecule which is a urea's [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1421.58s)]
*  inhibitor okay so this targets microorganisms in the gut which convert urea to ammonia and as I [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1428.62s)]
*  mentioned before ammonia is a toxin and so the idea here is to use this molecule to inhibit urea and [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1435.4199999999998s)]
*  to lessen the concentration of ammonia in patients. Right now we feel this is an important approach [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1443.02s)]
*  for treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy and as you probably know hepatic [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1449.34s)]
*  encephalopathy is an independent risk factor increasing the mortality of patients with aclf [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1455.34s)]
*  so in a nutshell these are five programs which we have in place for the treatment of patients [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1461.6599999999999s)]
*  with aclf1 and aclf2. You mentioned the fact that a variety of treatments are needed [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1468.1399999999999s)]
*  for aclf and you're doing individual clinical trials are you going to at some point have to kind [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1476.3s)]
*  of do trials on the combination of some of those assets? Yeah the way we would proceed is of course [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1483.58s)]
*  provide preclinical proof of concept and the team is also as we speak working hard to build our [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1492.14s)]
*  strategy as to how we would test these combinations eventually in the clinic so yeah this is something [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1498.38s)]
*  that we are working hard on and we'll move towards that. What are your ultimate hopes for [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1504.54s)]
*  success? I mean what does success look like for your assets when it comes to those suffering from [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1511.34s)]
*  aclf? I mentioned Jim that the pipeline of programs right now is really positioned [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1517.6599999999999s)]
*  for the treatment of patients with aclf1 and aclf2. The therapeutic goal of these treatments is really [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1524.3799999999999s)]
*  to first try to resolve the aclf of course if you resolve aclf that should impact on mortality. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1532.3s)]
*  What's also important is that we halt the progression of aclf in these patients and [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1539.42s)]
*  to stabilize these patients and that is going to be important because we know that liver transplants [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1546.38s)]
*  are beneficial in patients with aclf and as you know there's a limited number of livers available [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1552.38s)]
*  for transplants so if you have an approach that can stabilize the patient that can resolve their [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1559.18s)]
*  aclf then you provide a longer a larger time window which allows these patients for liver [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1565.18s)]
*  transplantation so this is also a very important aspect of any therapy in aclf. So for these [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1572.54s)]
*  patients with aclf our hope is that you know the technologies or the assets which we are developing [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1581.26s)]
*  our pipeline of course will be able to impact on resolution of NASH, increase survival and also [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1587.74s)]
*  stabilization allowing time for transplantation and in a nutshell basically it's important that [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1595.42s)]
*  you know right now patients who show up with aclf I think is very daunting for the clinicians who [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1602.14s)]
*  have to manage this clinical condition and what's important I think is to have different approaches [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1608.22s)]
*  which provide benefit to the patients of course but also make this a clinically manageable clinical [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1615.34s)]
*  condition and that we feel that any technology or any asset that can provide the benefits which I [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1622.94s)]
*  mentioned before of course will be something that's significant for these patients which [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1628.86s)]
*  right now today basically the current standard of care it's really to manage the failing organs [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1633.58s)]
*  in these patients so any therapy I think would be of great benefit to these patients. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1640.22s)]
*  Is there anything that you wanted to touch on that we hadn't covered? I just want to say you know this [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1646.6200000000001s)]
*  is an exciting time for us at GenFit and we feel we have the know-how the expertise to move the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1652.7800000000002s)]
*  field of aclf forward and then we feel that we have the correct pipeline or a very promising [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1659.9s)]
*  pipeline with complementary mechanisms of action which at the end will hopefully provide [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1666.7s)]
*  benefit to these patients with aclf. I mean what's also important is that as I mentioned before we're [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1671.98s)]
*  engaging with groups like EF Cliff that help move the field forward we're also working with other [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1678.94s)]
*  groups and one important group that we are engaging and working with is groups which who are involved [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1685.1000000000001s)]
*  with patients, patient associations for example things like the Global Liver Institute or ALPA [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1692.3s)]
*  in Europe these are groups which we're engaging with and really to take the voice of the patients [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1698.1399999999999s)]
*  into account in our global program in aclf and I think of course the patients have to be in the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1704.62s)]
*  center of any approach that we take and this is something that we're paying close attention to as well. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1710.3s)]
*  Well it definitely seems like GenFit and others are starting to make a big difference in a clear [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1722.3799999999999s)]
*  area of unmet need in the liver disease space. Don't forget to check out the latest news and [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6bzWM97_EM&t=1729.34s)]
