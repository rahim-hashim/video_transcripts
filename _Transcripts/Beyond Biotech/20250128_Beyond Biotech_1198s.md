# J.P. Morgan Annual Healthcare Conference 2025: trends and highlights you may have missed
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 127. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. A slight departure this week as we're talking to two [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=18.0s)]
*  companies about the recent JPM event in San Francisco or to give it its full name the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=24.24s)]
*  43rd annual JP Morgan Health Care Conference. It's always a highlight of the Biotech year [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=32.08s)]
*  and it's a great way to see right at the beginning of the year if there are any trends within [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=39.76s)]
*  the industry. I guess there weren't a load of deals made this year but that isn't necessarily [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=45.56s)]
*  a trend. A couple of topics that were somewhat connected but with no definitive answers were an [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=51.68s)]
*  increase in biotech companies and research coming out of China and the new Trump administration in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  the US. It remains to be seen exactly what policies the Trump administration will introduce in pharma [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=65.12s)]
*  and drug pricing and also what they will do with respect to trade and cooperation with China. So [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=72.16s)]
*  and of course the artificial intelligence debate is also a very hot topic as it continues to evolve [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=80.52s)]
*  and grow within the industry. But more importantly let's hear what a couple of participants at the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=87.68s)]
*  JPM event thought. We had the opportunity to catch up with Orca Bio's co-founder and CEO [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=93.68s)]
*  Ivan Dimov and also Parabolous Medicine's chief business officer Greg Miller. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=100.64s)]
*  We'll start with the answers from Orca Bio first. I wonder if before we talk about the event itself [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=108.04s)]
*  you could give us a bit of background on the company. So Orca Bio is a high precision cell [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  therapy company. We use single cell precision to build therapies that control the immune response [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=124.08s)]
*  and cure blood and immune diseases. We're currently in late stages of development with trials ranging [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  from phase one all the way to phase three and our initial focus is on resolving the mortalities [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=137.52s)]
*  associated with terminally ill patients that would be undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplants. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=143.32s)]
*  Our lead investigational cell therapy is Orca-T. It is in a pivotal phase three trial that we expect [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=150.08s)]
*  to read out pretty soon in the first half of this year. In parallel we are advancing a robust [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=160.4s)]
*  pipeline of investigational products for the treatment of other hematological malignancies [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=166.72000000000003s)]
*  such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma and autoimmune diseases as well. We're excited to present [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=171.96s)]
*  a JPM for the fifth year in a row kicking off the private track Monday morning. I reviewed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=180.08s)]
*  our strategic priorities and anticipated milestones for the year ahead and beyond which was largely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  centered around ensuring preparedness for our commercialization of our first product Orca-T. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=192.96s)]
*  I also shared exciting data that we published at ASH around our second and third generation products [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=198.28s)]
*  for patients suffering from other hematological malignancies beyond just leukemias. Each year JPM [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=206.6s)]
*  presents a unique opportunity to engage with key investors, analysts and other industry experts on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=214.52s)]
*  the latest industry happenings and forecasting the year to come. This year was no different for us [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=220.48s)]
*  at Orca Bio. We were very happy and privileged to be able to participate. And what were your [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=226.92s)]
*  impressions of the event this year? Kind of your highlights I guess? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=234.24s)]
*  So this year's meeting reflected a complex sentiment within the industry marked by cautious [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=237.92s)]
*  optimism amid prevailing challenges. As far as the broad themes that emerged throughout the week, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=245.84s)]
*  I'd say that the biggest headlines were around M&A activity, debates on innovation coming out [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=251.36s)]
*  of China, patent cliffs that many big pharma companies are facing and the uncertainty of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=258.16s)]
*  the administration change in Washington DC. It's hard to ignore major deals that led the week. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=263.32000000000005s)]
*  With the industry bracing for a series of patent cliffs, large cap players returned to high value [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=270.12s)]
*  deal making after several years of pretty muted signals on the M&A front. Some of the examples [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  starting off in the first day was led by J&J, right, a $15 billion acquisition in the neurology [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  space, then Eli Lilly with a $2.5 billion acquisition in the breast cancer space, and GSK [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=290.88s)]
*  a billion dollar acquisition in oncology. So it's really good to see that M&A is opening up again [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=297.2s)]
*  and it's very encouraging. I'd say the prevailing mood amongst attendees was one of cautious [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=302.8s)]
*  optimism with the industry's forward progress set to confront a mix of new and existing challenges. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=308.08s)]
*  And I walked away feeling not only energized for what is coming out of ORCA, but also encouraged [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=316.44s)]
*  and hopeful for the biofarm industry in the year ahead. While JPM did underscore existing challenges [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  and there was definitely a bit of momentum lacking from the markets and that was noted by most folks, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=329.24s)]
*  it also highlighted the areas of potential growth and innovation, indicating a cautious optimistic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  look for the biofarmer industry's future. Were there any deals or announcements at the event [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=340.44s)]
*  that you thought were particularly significant? I'd say I was definitely very surprised by [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=346.12s)]
*  the spree of M&A deals that was very encouraging and wasn't necessarily expected. That's definitely [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=353.48s)]
*  one thing that was interesting. Another thing that caught my attention quite a lot is conversations [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=362.76s)]
*  around innovation coming out of China and how there's been an acceleration of acquisition of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=370.2s)]
*  Chinese assets. That was definitely a new thing that has been accelerating and I felt that was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=376.28s)]
*  very compelling too. But ultimately I think the biggest surprise for me was just the amount of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=383.48s)]
*  AI-related companies, talks, and this whole new sector in the healthcare world that's opening up [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=391.4s)]
*  the new technologies coming out of Silicon Valley and beyond that really allow you to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=401.08s)]
*  do so many more tasks that before were very difficult if not impossible to achieve. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=407.4s)]
*  So I think all the digital health companies, a lot of the AI tools that are being used in drug [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=412.36s)]
*  development and discovery, a lot of the AI tools that are helping out clinical operations and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=418.04s)]
*  research in general within the pharma industry, that was also very surprising. It was the first [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  time that Nvidia presented at JP Morgan which is definitely a new development. So I think the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=430.44s)]
*  integration of these new technologies within the pharma industry has been a very interesting [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=436.91999999999996s)]
*  development for me and somewhat surprising at the speed of which is happening. Did you find that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=441.32s)]
*  there were any biotech sectors or maybe diseases or conditions that were more [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=446.92s)]
*  prominent than others this year? So similar to the last two years at JP Morgan, oncology [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=453.24s)]
*  seems to have continued to be the most discussed therapeutic area. The developments we're seeing [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=461.24s)]
*  in the space are very encouraging. As mentioned previously, GSK agreed to acquire [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=467.32s)]
*  IDRX for up to $1.15 billion, aiming to strengthen its oncology pipeline. Eli Lilly purchased [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=474.44s)]
*  Scorpion Therapeutics that has an experimental cancer therapy for up to $2.5 billion. And Abvi's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  option to license a new blood cancer drug candidate from SimSir Pharmaceutical valued at up to $1.06 [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=489.8s)]
*  billion really underscored the industry's focus on expanding cancer treatment options. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=498.6s)]
*  These substantial deals reflect a broader trend of increased deal making within the healthcare sector, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=505.72s)]
*  driven by I think the anticipation of a potentially more lenient antitrust environment [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=512.36s)]
*  under the incoming administration. Okay, great. Thanks so much, Ivan. That's Ivan Dimov, the CEO [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=517.4s)]
*  and co-founder of OrcaBio. And now let's turn it over to Greg Miller. And we'll ask the same [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=527.16s)]
*  questions of him, starting with some background on the company and the reasons for attending JPM. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=534.44s)]
*  We'll start with parabolis because I think obviously it's relevant to just know [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  where the company is and how it fits into the JPM landscape. As you probably know, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=545.4s)]
*  it's about a nine-year-old company, formerly Fog Pharma. And really with that vision of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  using peptides in an alpha helical constrained structure to get into cells and target [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=555.32s)]
*  intracellular targets that previously had not been drugable. Greg Verdyne, as the founder many [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=561.6400000000001s)]
*  years back. And really I came into the company a little over a year ago. The company had just moved [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=567.1600000000001s)]
*  in to clinic with a beta-catenin inhibitor. And so a step back, beta-catenin is a target that has been, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  you probably have seen it throughout the landscape of undruggables and well defined as a driver of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=580.76s)]
*  colorectal cancer and many other solid tumors. And so the ability to target beta-catenin has long [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  been held as a holy grail. And so in coming in, already there was exciting in vivo validation data [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  and a great package going into the clinic. And so that program is now in clinic and translating [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=601.64s)]
*  well. Matai presented at JPN for the second time this year. Matai Mamman, obviously, he joined as [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=607.96s)]
*  CEO about a year and a half ago when really that program was on the cusp of entering into the clinic. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=612.6s)]
*  And so he presented some validating translational data in patients from the phase one trial that's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=618.84s)]
*  ongoing, which shows that we have PRs in tumors that are, I'd say, in the simpler side of tumors, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=625.4000000000001s)]
*  desmoid tumors, cranial fringeoma patient. And we have some really compelling data that's unrolling [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=633.24s)]
*  in colorectal cancer. And we'll continue to unroll that as it grows over this year. So the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=639.08s)]
*  Helicon platform has now been validated in clinic. And probably equally important is that we now have [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=644.76s)]
*  a second program that has in vivo validation, which is targeting ERG, another intracellular [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=650.28s)]
*  protein that has previously not been able to be achieved with small molecules and obviously with [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=656.2s)]
*  antibodies. And it's a key driver of prostate cancer. And so we have in vivo validation of [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=661.56s)]
*  that now. And we're actually approaching that using the Helicon peptide in addition to a ligase for [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  degradation. It's a fantastic time to be part of a platform company that has this level of validation. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=673.4s)]
*  And frankly, peptides are at a really unique moment in time right now where they're not as [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=680.04s)]
*  commoditized as antibodies and small molecules. They're a little bit more complex to make, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=685.64s)]
*  but they are widely accepted as therapeutics, for example, GOP1s, of course. So it's really in that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=691.16s)]
*  sweet spot of both innovation, but de-risking that allows a company like ours to really build on that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=697.88s)]
*  and really tackle hard biologically validated targets. We went to JP Morgan, really, we have a [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=704.8399999999999s)]
*  lot of interest in collaboration around our lead program, 5.001, the beta-catenin inhibitor. We use [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=711.24s)]
*  this as a bit of an update for where that program is with potential partners. And we do intend to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=717.0s)]
*  establish a partnership that would still allow Parabolus to grow as a company and participate, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=722.44s)]
*  but also to globalize and really maximize the program as quickly as possible. But we use this [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=729.56s)]
*  more as an update as we think about later in the year how we want to proceed with that partnership. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=735.56s)]
*  Also to highlight the platform capabilities now that it's been twice validated and really to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=741.08s)]
*  start to think about both how can we enable partners with targets both in oncology and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=746.76s)]
*  outside of oncology through collaboration, but also how can we expand our capabilities through [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=753.0s)]
*  collaboration? What were your impressions and highlights for this year and maybe compared to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=757.0s)]
*  previous versions? It felt a little more tame, but that's not a bad thing. It feels like it was more [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=763.8s)]
*  kind of regression to the mean in some ways. There've been a lot of years where it feels like the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=769.96s)]
*  event invites a type of distraction that it's not unhealthy, but it doesn't necessarily, it's not [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=775.4s)]
*  mission oriented. And it felt this year that there's an awareness of the fact that there isn't time for [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=782.52s)]
*  lack of focus, that we need to be able to very clearly enunciate what is our value proposition, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=791.4s)]
*  how it would enable progression in discovery and ultimately how it fits into the disease state. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=798.5200000000001s)]
*  The saying steak versus sizzle, it felt like everyone is looking for steak right now. There [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=806.6s)]
*  isn't the feeling that there is going to be an introduction of a new concept that will solve both [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  pipeline holes and loss of exclusivity at the same time as all of our health problems. So [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=818.9200000000001s)]
*  understanding your technology, understanding where it can best address health and putting the [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=826.12s)]
*  thought into it and not expecting the thought to be done by the potential partner. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=833.16s)]
*  Were there any kind of major deals or announcements or topics that you thought were [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=838.04s)]
*  particularly significant this year? Well, certainly, I mean, everyone's, everyone's [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=845.0s)]
*  focused right now on assets coming out of China. That's evident. That does cause a strain on [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=849.0s)]
*  funding in high risk innovation because these are incremental, important, but incremental changes, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=857.56s)]
*  but having assets that have the opportunity to really be considered de-risked and to reach the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=865.24s)]
*  market, that's important to pharma. So there's less of a reward for companies that are really [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=870.92s)]
*  coming with a completely novel concept. The most significant deals that happened, I would say, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=878.12s)]
*  probably Intracellular and Scorpion caught my eye. Scorpion in the fact that that was an [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=884.04s)]
*  acquisition with a spin out, that's intriguing for a company that has created meaningful value [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=889.4s)]
*  with a lead asset, but thinking through what is the right way to capitalize the company, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=895.08s)]
*  bring a return to investors. I thought that was a really interesting deal. And the other one, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=901.8s)]
*  of course, is Intracellular. Intracellular being kind of the converse of that, which is how do you [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=906.12s)]
*  take the time to build out a pipeline on your own and really persevere and create meaningful [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=910.92s)]
*  value to investors, but not necessarily be as on the radar as a number of other companies. I think [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=916.92s)]
*  those are two really contrasting deals, but really intriguing in ways in which companies have found [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=923.72s)]
*  a meaningful exit for their investors. We have a new administration in the US and lots of [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=930.68s)]
*  questions still about what is the new administration going to do with pharma, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=938.5999999999999s)]
*  relationships with other countries? Was that a cloud hanging over the event or was it just [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=944.3599999999999s)]
*  kind of side discussions? I'm a bit of a contrarian about this. So in my own opinion, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=951.4s)]
*  they cloud my thoughts here. But I do think that if we're learning anything from, for example, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=956.76s)]
*  how TikTok is being treated, I think there's support for whatever maximizes value. And I [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=963.16s)]
*  think that there's a lot of positioning, but I think ultimately driven by economic interests, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=971.48s)]
*  there's likely to be solutions. I worry less about the geopolitical climate as long as there's a [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=978.92s)]
*  commonality of economic interests. There's creative ways to solve for it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=987.8000000000001s)]
*  Were there any sectors or disease areas that were more center stage than others? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=993.48s)]
*  Immunology as a whole has definitely taken center stage. I would say oncology, where we tend to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=999.64s)]
*  focus our attention, people recognize it's a very challenging path as an independent company. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1006.44s)]
*  And it's well worth pursuing. But I think as we continue to think about just risk mitigation [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  in this current climate, parties are looking for less competitive or less crowded landscapes, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  although it becomes self-fulfilling because then everyone is glomming onto the same space. So it's [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1024.76s)]
*  cyclical in nature, but there was a lot of expertise that was built in the immunology space [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1030.52s)]
*  surrounding around immunology. So it kind of makes sense to build off of that expertise [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1036.12s)]
*  into other therapeutic areas. Say the jury is out still on rare diseases, there seems to be [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1041.4799999999998s)]
*  some interesting green shoots of reinvigoration of certain disease areas that fall under [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1047.7199999999998s)]
*  rare diseases. But it's a bit of a rethink as well. Certainly with the IRA as an overhang, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1055.2399999999998s)]
*  it still forces one to think differently about pipelines within a product if it pertains to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1060.28s)]
*  a rare disease. But I think outside of that, there are still some excellent opportunities [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1066.44s)]
*  within rare diseases. Was it an optimistic feel that in terms of people optimistic about [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1071.3999999999999s)]
*  the biotech and biopharma industries in 2025 and financing and all those things, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1078.68s)]
*  or is there still a bit of fear? I think the fear remains, but I think we're at a transitional state [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1084.36s)]
*  I think we need to see this post-election cycle really bear out, see what happens. Of course, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1090.44s)]
*  it always comes back to the rates for a number of factors. See how the ripple effect looks there. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1097.48s)]
*  And of course, it doesn't help that there's been a lot of turnover, a lot of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1104.68s)]
*  reductions in staff now. I mean, of course, people pay attention to that because that's usually done [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1108.44s)]
*  and unmasked while hiring is done on an individual basis. So it's kind of an over [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1113.24s)]
*  scrutinizing, but it's a cautious environment. But the things that need to get funded do get [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1119.0s)]
*  funded. It just takes longer. The scale of funding tends to be larger for those things that are [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1124.28s)]
*  de-risked or considered de-risked. So it's about what are the right opportunities. And I think that [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1131.0s)]
*  one could be optimistic if they fit into those descriptions. And then if you're thinking about [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1137.24s)]
*  starting a high-risk editing company right now may not be the exact right time. It's a balance, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1142.44s)]
*  but I do think that over the next six months or so, we'll have a lot more data points to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1148.76s)]
*  know whether that caution is founded or not. A really good overview of one of the most important [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1153.8799999999999s)]
*  biotech and biopharma events of the year, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Always an [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1160.04s)]
*  interesting start to the calendar year. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3V7Ygb1m8&t=1166.92s)]
