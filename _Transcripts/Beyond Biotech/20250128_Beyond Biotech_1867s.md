Video Description: There is a constant risk of severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reactions for individuals with peanut allergies, which leads to significant physical, social, and emotional burdens.


IgGenix, a clinical-stage immunology biotechnology company, recently announced the first patient dosed in its phase 1 trial evaluating IGNX001, a novel monoclonal antibody-based therapeutic, for peanut allergy. 


Designed to neutralize the most clinically important peanut allergens and epitopes, IGNX001 combats peanut allergies by blocking the allergic cascade and reducing risk of anaphylaxis.


Should IGNX001 prove successful, it will provide a promising solution for peanut allergies and pave the way for IgGenix's technology to be applied to other types of food allergies and allergic diseases.


Our guest on the podcast this week is Jessica Grossman, chief executive officer of IgGenix.

# Finding new treatments for peanut allergy
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 123. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=15.88s)]
*  I'm sure that everyone listening has or knows someone with an allergy of some kind. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=20.32s)]
*  For me it's blueberries and certain pollens. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=26.52s)]
*  The most common one is peanut allergy and even if you don't have the allergy I'm sure [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=29.64s)]
*  you've heard flight announcements about it or had notes from school to not send anything [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=35.36s)]
*  with peanuts for lunch. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=40.68s)]
*  IGenex is a clinical stage immunology biotech company that recently announced the first [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  patient had been dosed in its trial evaluating IGNX 001, a novel monoclonal antibody based [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  therapeutic for peanut allergy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=58.56s)]
*  To tell us about that trial, allergies in general and what can be done to treat them [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  our guest this week is IGenex CEO Jessica Grossman. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=67.48s)]
*  Alright, so welcome to the podcast and first off could you tell us a little bit about the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=72.92s)]
*  company? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=79.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=80.4s)]
*  So IGenex is now a clinical stage antibody discovery and development company focused [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=82.04s)]
*  on the intersection of IgE in health and disease, IgE antibodies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  The company was founded and started in 2019 out of Stanford University out of two prominent [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=97.92s)]
*  labs there, one lab of Dr. Stephen Quake and the other lab was Dr. Kari Nadeau who is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=104.92s)]
*  a prominent food allergy expert. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=114.44s)]
*  And the whole company is based on a discovery around the ability to isolate at a single [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=117.72s)]
*  cell level the very rare allergens that are found in the body. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=127.72s)]
*  B cells that produce IgE antibodies and IgE antibodies are the antibodies that are implicated [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=135.28s)]
*  in many different diseases but the most common one and well known are food allergies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=144.16s)]
*  And so the company started in 2019, it was spun out of Stanford, it was based around [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=150.44s)]
*  a seminal publication in the journal Science that was published in 2018 and then I joined [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=157.32s)]
*  the company as the first full time professional CEO in 2020. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=164.44s)]
*  Obviously we're talking mostly about peanut allergies but I wonder if you could give us [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=169.44s)]
*  some facts or background on peanut allergy itself, just how widespread it is and how [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=175.92s)]
*  it affects the body and whether it's something that's on the increase or whether it's a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=184.12s)]
*  stable number of people that suffer from this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=189.32s)]
*  Yeah absolutely and I think we are talking about peanut allergy because that is our first [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=192.88s)]
*  program that we're in the clinic with but even to kind of go a little bit further back [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=199.6s)]
*  than that as I mentioned, you know our body naturally produces antibodies that are a way [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=206.28s)]
*  to protect against pathogens, disease, toxin and IgE antibodies are the rarest class of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=213.28s)]
*  antibodies, they're almost kind of one in a million compared to the other antibodies. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=220.28s)]
*  And those are the antibodies that traditionally have protected us against pathogens that can [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=225.28s)]
*  oftentimes get in through the skin, so things like worms and stuff like that. And so food [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=230.28s)]
*  allergy in many ways is sort of an autoimmune disease when those IgE antibodies end up sort [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=237.28s)]
*  of attacking other antibodies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=243.28s)]
*  IgE antibodies end up sort of attacking known proteins and known substances that can come [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=246.28s)]
*  into the body like peanut. And just to give you kind of a little bit of a snapshot on [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=255.28s)]
*  peanut allergy, it's actually one of the most common and serious food allergies, especially [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=261.28s)]
*  in children, it affects about one or two percent of children in the United States. And that's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=268.28s)]
*  actually probably a global number as well. And then also it's common in adults in the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=274.28s)]
*  U.S. 4.6 million adults have peanut allergy and about 800,000 of those are diagnosed after [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=280.28s)]
*  the age of 18. So it's an IgE mediated allergic reaction where the immune system mistakenly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=289.28s)]
*  recognizes peanut proteins as harmful, but in any food allergy, let's call it wheat, shellfish, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=299.28s)]
*  milk, same thing. And then only about 20 percent of children actually outgrow their peanut [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=306.28s)]
*  allergies, so it's often a lifelong condition. And then, Jim, you asked about what about the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=313.28s)]
*  prevalence and is this increasing? And it is, in fact, increasing. The prevalence of peanut [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=320.28s)]
*  allergy has increased by 3.5 percent over the last kind of two decades from 1997 to 2008. And [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=327.28s)]
*  nobody really knows the exact reason why there is this increase in prevalence. There are many [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=337.28s)]
*  theories. One of the theories is environmental factors that we now have changes in the way that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=347.28s)]
*  we live. We have changes in our diet. There's the hygiene hypothesis that, you know, in fact, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=356.28s)]
*  we're actually too clean and we should be out there playing and, you know, working in the dirt. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=363.28s)]
*  So those are two hypotheses. There's also some thought that changes in the skin barrier and skin [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=370.28s)]
*  barrier dysfunction could lead to an increase in allergies. And then there's also the thought that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=377.28s)]
*  just increased awareness and diagnosis is one of the culprits. Are allergies in general on the rise? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=384.28s)]
*  I mean, there's obviously you mentioned dairy, seafood, wheat. Yes, allergies are on the on the rise [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=393.28s)]
*  across the world. So this is a global issue. And again, many people think that it's due to the way [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=401.28s)]
*  that we sort of changed the way that we live, increased urbanization, increased cleanliness, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=409.28s)]
*  increased detergents are all factors that instead of our IGE antibodies doing what they were [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=415.28s)]
*  evolutionarily programmed to do, fighting off worms and some different types of pathogens and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=423.28s)]
*  infections, they're now mistakenly recognizing what was before kind of a normal protein like a [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=429.28s)]
*  peanut protein or a shrimp protein. They're now recognizing those as harmful and really mounting an allergic [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=438.28s)]
*  response against those proteins. This may be a stupid question, but are the responses to allergies the same? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=447.28s)]
*  So, for example, would the response to a dairy allergy be exactly the same as the response to a peanut allergy? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=457.28s)]
*  Yes, that's actually I think a really good question. So the way that allergies, food allergies and environmental allergies [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=466.28s)]
*  play out is these IGE antibodies that I've been talking about. They are attached to some defense cells in our bodies [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=475.28s)]
*  known as mast cells and basophils. Those are kind of the culprit cells. And when a protein and whether it be a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=486.28s)]
*  peanut protein, a wheat protein, a milk protein, attaches to these IGE antibodies that are on mast cells and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=495.28s)]
*  basophils, it starts off the allergic cascade. And so the symptoms of the allergic cascade, whether it be hives, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=504.28s)]
*  swelling, vomiting, and in the worst case, anaphylaxis and low blood pressure and even death, the symptoms [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=514.28s)]
*  regardless of the allergen are the same. I guess everybody would know about EpiPens that are used in response to an allergic [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=522.28s)]
*  reaction. But what are the problems with treatments for allergies? Yeah, so really still to this day, the gold standard treatment [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=530.28s)]
*  is strict avoidance. And that can be quite difficult, especially with peanut because peanut protein turns out to be a great [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=541.28s)]
*  low cost source of protein. And peanut flour can find its way into a lot of things, including bread, pizza crust, etc. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=551.28s)]
*  So again, the kind of gold standard treatment is strict avoidance. EpiPens aren't really a treatment per se. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=561.28s)]
*  They're a first line rescue therapy. And I think that that's an important distinction. They are effective and very important, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=571.28s)]
*  but they're a rescue therapy in people that are having an allergic reaction. They're not a kind of a day to day treatment that people [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=580.28s)]
*  can utilize. And some of the challenges with EpiPens, they expire. They're not always available. What if you forget your EpiPen? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=590.28s)]
*  What if you're out and about, don't have it? Although they're a great first line rescue therapy for severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=600.28s)]
*  they're not really a treatment. Are there any treatments for any you mentioned avoidance? Are there any other treatments currently available for any allergies? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=610.28s)]
*  They are two FDA approved treatment. One is called Palforzia, which is essentially micro dosing, if you will, of peanut protein. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=622.28s)]
*  It's a daily treatment that's FDA approved where an individual, it's only approved in children, an individual would have to take a small dose of this peanut protein daily. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=635.28s)]
*  And it takes about six months to a year to start to work. And there are a lot of adverse events and side effects, as you can imagine, because you're taking that protein that you're allergic to. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=651.28s)]
*  The second FDA approved treatment is an antibody therapeutic, which we are aiming to provide as well. Our peanut program that's currently in the clinic is called IGNX 001. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=663.28s)]
*  And it is an antibody therapeutic delivered subcutaneously. So the FDA approved antibody therapeutic is known as Omalizumab or Zolair. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=676.28s)]
*  And it is an anti-IGE therapy. So what it does is it attacks or binds to those IGE antibodies that are circulating in the bloodstream. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=688.28s)]
*  It just got approved for food allergy this year. There was a big study that was in the New England Journal of Medicine. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=703.28s)]
*  And it's been on the market for other treatments for many years, so it has a great safety record. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=711.28s)]
*  However, it takes time to work. That's one of the challenges with it, because it needs to really soak up or deplete all of the circulating IGE in your body. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=719.28s)]
*  It can take about 12 to 18 weeks to work. And it is a pretty frequent injection in that study that I mentioned, that phase three clinical trial. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=731.28s)]
*  About over 50 percent of the patients had to be injected every two weeks with the antibody. And then it's not good for everybody. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=742.28s)]
*  It's not appropriate for individuals with high IGE levels. So we think that although this is a good step forward as an FDA approved treatment for food allergy, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=753.28s)]
*  and I should also say that since that approval, the drug is doing quite well. I believe the earnings call from Roche said that 30,000 new patients were on therapy for food allergy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=765.28s)]
*  So although it's a big step forward, we think that there are limitations in that treatment that Igenics' product, IGNX-001, that's still in development could potentially address. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=780.28s)]
*  Namely, the speed to onset of action. We're aiming to have really almost immediate onset of action with our antibody therapeutic, a matter of days versus 12 to 18 weeks. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=796.28s)]
*  Also, frequency of injection. As I said, over 50 percent of the patients needed to be injected every two weeks. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=811.28s)]
*  Although we're still in early days, we're aiming to have our antibody injected much less frequently. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=819.28s)]
*  And then last but not least, we believe that there should be no limitation on total IGE levels. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=825.28s)]
*  When it comes to developing drugs for or treatments for allergies, what are the challenges of doing that? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=832.28s)]
*  That's also a good question. Many of the treatments and therapies that have been developed to date are actually kind of based on older data, and they're all really based on food type therapy. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=842.28s)]
*  So like I said, palphorzia is small doses of peanut protein given orally every day. So that's called oral immunotherapy. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=861.28s)]
*  There's also something called epicutaneous immunotherapy, also using peanut protein on the skin. There's sublingual immunotherapy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=871.28s)]
*  And so all of those types of treatments are based on giving the allergen, giving the food in small doses on a daily basis. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=881.28s)]
*  And so they all have side effects. They all can cause allergic reactions and even in severe cases cause anaphylaxis. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=892.28s)]
*  And they can be quite difficult for patients to take. And so that's been a major limitation is this food based therapy and can be very challenging for patients to take, physicians to manage because of this high side effect rate. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=900.28s)]
*  They need to be taken on a daily basis. And so what we're developing is a new type of treatment, an antibody based therapeutic that's really cutting edge science based on reengineering those IgE antibodies that I've been talking about into therapeutic blockers. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=916.28s)]
*  So we're reengineering the IgE into an IgG blocking antibody. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=937.28s)]
*  And how do you overcome things like the placebo effect, which appears to be quite large in controlled clinical trials when it comes to allergen immunotherapy? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=944.28s)]
*  Some of the allergen immunotherapy trials that have been done over time can have quite a high placebo rate. And I'm not I can't speak to why that is. I'm not sure. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=956.28s)]
*  But some of the more recent ones like the Palisade trial for Palforcia, that FDA approved drug that I talked about earlier, that actually only had a 4% placebo rate of patients that were able to tolerate a dose of a food challenge, a 600 milligram food challenge. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=969.28s)]
*  And then the New England Journal of Medicine study that I was talking about with Zollair had about a 7% placebo rate. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=991.28s)]
*  So in recent FDA phase three trials, the placebo rate has been quite reasonable and lower. I can't speak to why that is versus some of those earlier trials. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1000.28s)]
*  You mentioned earlier how there are lots of people with a variety of different allergies. Is this an area that a lot of companies are working on? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1014.28s)]
*  I would say not nearly as many companies that are working on oncology or even things like atopic dermatitis. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1024.28s)]
*  There are a growing amount of companies that are working on food allergy with various attempts. We are the only ones that are in the clinic with a blocking antibody. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1033.28s)]
*  So with our mechanism of action. So that's super exciting because we're way out in front of many of other companies. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1046.28s)]
*  Most of the other companies are working on a food based solution, whether it be an oral type immunotherapy. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1056.28s)]
*  Some are working on kind of peanut vaccines, if you will, which are kind of giving peanut protein in kind of a vaccine type setting. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1066.28s)]
*  So there's a handful of companies working on and it's mostly peanut allergy because peanut allergy is quite prevalent. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1078.28s)]
*  Very few companies working on the other allergies. And I should say that shrimp allergy is our number two program that's next up in our pipeline. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1086.28s)]
*  Could you maybe go into a bit more detail about how you're tackling this and your platform? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1099.28s)]
*  Yeah, so our antibody discovery platform, which we call SeqSifter, it's a patented discovery platform. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1105.28s)]
*  It's based on the work that came out of that 2018 science paper and came out of Stanford University. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1114.28s)]
*  And what it is, it's a technology where we use single cell RNA sequencing to isolate out these single B cells, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1122.28s)]
*  which is a white blood cell that are producing these IgE antibodies. We take those cells and we essentially explode them, if you will, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1134.28s)]
*  burst them or lyse them and extract all of the messenger RNA from those cells. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1145.28s)]
*  And then we're able to analyze that messenger RNA and reconstruct the RNA that's making those IgE antibodies. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1151.28s)]
*  We're able to reconstruct, and we're the only ones who can do this, the full heavy and light chain sequences of those antibodies. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1161.28s)]
*  We then take those sequences of the antibodies that include the areas on the antibodies that bind to the peanut protein or, you know, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1171.28s)]
*  attract to the peanut protein, and we re-engineer them into IgG antibodies. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1183.28s)]
*  It's a complex process using cutting edge science and technology where we are able to re-engineer antibodies [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1189.28s)]
*  and change these kind of harmful IgE antibodies into helpful IgG antibodies. We do this over time. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1200.28s)]
*  We've done this with now hundreds of patients which have yielded thousands or tens of thousands of IgE sequences. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1209.28s)]
*  And what that data has done is it's been able to show us in individuals with peanut allergy and now we're working on shrimp allergy as well, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1219.28s)]
*  what are the most important proteins and epitopes across individuals that are causing the allergic reactions? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1228.28s)]
*  And so for peanut, we've developed what we believe to be a universal peanut blocker, and our antibodies are binding or sopping up, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1238.28s)]
*  if you will, the peanut protein and the most common areas of the protein that are immunodominant across individuals who have peanut allergy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1250.28s)]
*  It seems like Seek-Sifter is quite an impressive program. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1264.28s)]
*  Yes, in a nutshell, what Seek-Sifter does is it isolates out very rare IgE producing B cells, is able to extract all of the RNA sequences. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1267.28s)]
*  We convert those to DNA and we use those DNA sequences to construct or re-engineer blocking antibodies, functional blocking antibodies. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1280.28s)]
*  Is that specific to IgNx001? I mean, how does that work or is that what you just described? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1292.28s)]
*  Yeah, so IgNx001 is our peanut blocking antibody. It was derived from our Seek-Sifter platform. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1299.28s)]
*  Over hundreds of patients and thousands of IgE sequences, we were able to find the absolute best sequence, the best antibodies, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1306.28s)]
*  the ones that had the highest affinity, meaning the tightest binders are antibodies that are actually picomolar affinity, which is very high. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1319.28s)]
*  And what the drug does is it is able to act like a heat seeking missile to find and neutralize peanut protein. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1329.28s)]
*  IgNx001 is delivered via a subcutaneous injection. So that's an injection right underneath the skin. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1343.28s)]
*  And then it takes a day or two to get widely into the bloodstream. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1352.28s)]
*  And the way that we believe it acts in humans and the way that we know that it acts in our preclinical studies, we've studied this in both mice and monkey model, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1357.28s)]
*  is that in animals that have the antibody in their bloodstream, if you then expose those animals in preclinical studies to peanut, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1367.28s)]
*  IgNx001 is able to neutralize that peanut so that individuals don't have an allergic reaction. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1379.28s)]
*  So IgNx001 is able to get to the peanut before the peanut can get to those IgE antibodies that are sitting on mast cells and basophils and start the allergic cascade. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1388.28s)]
*  So we're really preventing the allergic cascade before it starts. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1401.28s)]
*  So the way that we like to think about it is individuals on IgNx001 will be protected from accidental exposure to peanut, because that's what people are most worried about. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1407.28s)]
*  As we talked about earlier, people with peanut allergy, they're avoiding peanuts, right? That's the gold standard. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1421.28s)]
*  And many people who have been allergic to peanuts their whole life, they have taste aversion, they don't want to eat peanuts. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1428.28s)]
*  They just want protection if they're accidentally exposed. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1435.28s)]
*  And this is exactly what IgNx001 will give them. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1441.28s)]
*  It will act on board to provide protection against those peanut allergies before, so to prevent the allergic reaction from even starting. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1445.28s)]
*  And how often does it have to be administered? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1459.28s)]
*  Well, we don't know yet because we're still in that phase one study. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1463.28s)]
*  But what I can tell you is that in our models from our preclinical studies, we believe it can be at least a month, at least monthly injection and maybe even every other month. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1468.28s)]
*  You're mentioning how that gold standard is avoidance and that you're trying to get to a stage where people aren't necessarily afraid of exposure. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1482.28s)]
*  Does it ultimately mean or could it ultimately lead to people with peanut allergy being able to actually eat peanuts again? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1492.28s)]
*  Well, again, it's early days, so we don't know. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1500.28s)]
*  I would say that many individuals that I've talked to who have peanut allergy really aren't interested in eating peanut. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1504.28s)]
*  They're really interested in protection. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1512.28s)]
*  I think the other challenge is with the FDA. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1514.28s)]
*  I think it's unlikely that the FDA will ever give approval to someone being able to freely eat peanuts. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1518.28s)]
*  I think that the gold standard of allergy avoidance will continue. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1526.28s)]
*  But it is possible that with this protective antibody, people could be able to tolerate much more peanut protein than they could with then with their allergy before treatment. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1531.28s)]
*  What's the clinical trial picture looking like? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1547.28s)]
*  We're in the clinic right now in our phase one study. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1550.28s)]
*  It's a single ascending dose study, and we've had several patients dosed, which is very exciting. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1554.28s)]
*  And we're in the process of our first cohort, and we're hoping to elevate to our second cohort. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1562.28s)]
*  The first cohort is with the lowest dose of the drug. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1572.28s)]
*  We're hoping to elevate to our second cohort in the new year. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1575.28s)]
*  You mentioned about working on shrimp. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1579.28s)]
*  Is this technology that could be adapted to other allergies, dairy, eggs, and maybe even things that aren't food allergens like pollen? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1582.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1593.28s)]
*  So the poor technology on isolating these bad, harmful antibodies, these IgE antibodies from allergic individuals, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1594.28s)]
*  we've actually isolated IgE antibodies to really essentially all of the allergens that people are allergic to. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1603.28s)]
*  Dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, even alpha-gal, which is a rare red meat allergy, but is on the rise. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1613.28s)]
*  Also, all sorts of pollens, molds, dust mites, bee venom, you know, you name it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1622.28s)]
*  If people have an IgE-mediated allergic reaction, we have antibodies for that. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1630.28s)]
*  And so, yes, eventually we could use this technology to develop therapeutics for all of those allergies. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1635.28s)]
*  And then I will also say we're just starting some new cutting edge research on other IgE-mediated diseases like atopic dermatitis. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1644.28s)]
*  So there's also a possibility that we could develop a therapeutic for some of those other diseases outside of allergies that are mediated by IgE antibodies. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1654.28s)]
*  Excellent news for people that are affected by that, for sure. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1665.28s)]
*  Do you develop all of these potential allergy treatments the same or do they have variations? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1668.28s)]
*  I would say that the core underlying seek-sifter technology is quite similar in the way that we discover the antibodies. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1675.28s)]
*  The preclinical roadmaps might be slightly different. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1686.28s)]
*  That's actually one of the areas that we're investigating right now with our shellfish, our shrimp antibodies. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1690.28s)]
*  For peanut, we went through a fairly systematic process of discovering the antibodies, doing a bunch of in vitro clinical testing, blocking ELISA's, basophil activation tests, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1698.28s)]
*  mast cell activation tests, which are both in vitro kind of food challenge in a test tube. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1711.28s)]
*  Then we moved on to animal studies, looking at a preclinical allergy model of peanut allergy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1717.28s)]
*  And we're just in that step with our shrimp antibodies as well. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1724.28s)]
*  So still early days. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1729.28s)]
*  We don't know if it's going to be exactly the same development pathway, but should be similar. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1731.28s)]
*  What else do you have in your pipeline? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1735.28s)]
*  You were mentioning treating things other than allergies. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1738.28s)]
*  So, yeah, we're in early days on the research side, but we're working on atopic dermatitis as well. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1742.28s)]
*  Atopic dermatitis is another very common disease that affects millions of individuals where their lives are disrupted by this chronic itch. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1749.28s)]
*  And we're hopeful that we might be able to find a therapy that could be effective for patients with very high IGE levels or with patients where other therapies don't work. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1761.28s)]
*  What do you see the future as for allergy sufferers? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1775.28s)]
*  We're quite hopeful. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1779.28s)]
*  And, you know, really our mission is to provide individuals and families affected by allergies the potential to live without the fear and anxiety of having a life threatening allergic reaction. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1781.28s)]
*  And I think that's what people really care about is being able to go out into the world, you know, have normal activities of daily living and not live with the constant threat of a potential allergic reaction that could have really terrible consequences. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1801.28s)]
*  Great news potentially for peanut allergy sufferers and hopefully all allergy sufferers in the long run. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1822.28s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1835.28s)]
*  And I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1842.28s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E38xpOCuaZw&t=1846.28s)]
