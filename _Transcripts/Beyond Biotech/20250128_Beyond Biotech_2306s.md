Video Description: Artificial intelligence (AI) is certainly in the news constantly; however, it’s been used in drug discovery for some time.


A new collaboration between artificial intelligence drug discovery company Insilico Medicine and University of Toronto biochemist and molecular geneticist Igor Stagljar will test AI-designed molecules against "undruggable" cancer targets. 



The research will test 15 to 20 undruggable targets - but are they undruggable? And how does AI work in the drug discovery process?



This week, we have a conversation with Kyle Tretina, Alliance Manager of AI Platforms at Insilico Medicine, on a wide range of subjects including drug discovery, undruggable targets, the collaboration with the University of Toronto, and more.

# How does AI assist drug discovery?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 83. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech and this week we have a very interesting look, or a guest [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=16.28s)]
*  listen, at the world of artificial intelligence and its use in drug discovery. The company [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=22.2s)]
*  Insilico Medicine is collaborating with the University of Toronto to test AI designed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=28.48s)]
*  molecules against undruggable cancer targets. And I appreciate if you're from there you don't [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=34.32s)]
*  call it Toronto, having lived there for many years. To tell us all about artificial intelligence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=40.32s)]
*  in drug discovery is Kyle Tratina, Alliance Manager of AI Platforms at Insilico Medicine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=45.8s)]
*  And I'll let him do the introductions to both himself and the company. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=53.6s)]
*  I'm Kyle Tratina, Alliance Manager here at Insilico Medicine. That basically means that I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=57.88s)]
*  manage our projects with big pharma, biotech and academics. My background, my PhD was in infectious [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=62.64s)]
*  disease and using multi-omex technology to answer questions in that area. I've been with the company [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=68.52s)]
*  for about a year, Boston based, but the company goes back actually really far compared to sort of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=74.2s)]
*  the age of this field where there's been a recent insurgence of AI and drug discovery and development. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=79.56s)]
*  We really clocked back to 2014 where we started really as an academic group. So our founder Alex [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=85.56s)]
*  Shevronkov started his lab at Johns Hopkins in 2014. Funny enough, I was actually getting my PhD [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=92.44s)]
*  at the same time just on the other side of Baltimore. We might have passed each other in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=98.92s)]
*  the hallway at some point and I didn't realize at the time. And at that time him and his lab were [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=102.2s)]
*  really focused on developing algorithms that could make drug discovery faster and more successful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=107.48s)]
*  So this group wrote some really, really, really clever sort of breakthrough stuff, especially in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=116.28s)]
*  generative adversarial networks along those lines and founded the company in 2014. So early on, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=122.28s)]
*  we were a services like service-based company. So essentially starting collaborations with big [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=128.84s)]
*  pharma and some biotechs in the area and then more regionally as well for drug development [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=135.32s)]
*  projects. So things like identifying new targets for drugs, designing new drugs, were kind of really [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=140.84s)]
*  a lot of our common use cases. And then as an academic group, they really needed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=147.88s)]
*  academic government funding for a lot of the early work, but not transitioning to really focus on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  the company in the few years sort of following up to that. Now around that time, sort of mid 2010, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=159.48s)]
*  was a really interesting time in the field because we saw a lot of these new deep learning systems [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  that were outperforming humans and some things that traditionally humans have been the only ones [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=171.48s)]
*  that have been able to do it, like image recognition, voice recognition, text recognition, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=176.44s)]
*  other jobs as well. So through 2016 and through 2019, there was this huge rush because of these [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  more basic mathematical developments. There was this giant rush of competitors. There were maybe [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=187.72s)]
*  a thousand competitors from around the world at that time. It seemed like any professor with a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=192.28s)]
*  paper in the field wanted to start a company. And then it was in 2019 when Ensilico launched their [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=197.64s)]
*  own platform, including a SaaS product. They also work in the service spaces as well. As well as in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  2019, they started their own therapeutic programs. Now this was really, really important for the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=210.04s)]
*  company because especially at that time, some companies were focused mostly on being AI software [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=214.92s)]
*  company. Other companies were really focused on building out their pipeline, but Ensilico Medicine [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  is always really focused on both. It turned out to be a competitive advantage because you can use the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  pipeline to validate your software. You're not relying on anyone else to do that. But then from [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  2019 through 2023, there's been this really huge explosion in Ensilico in terms of ongoing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  commercialization and for the development of our generative AI algorithms. But the niche as a whole [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=240.92s)]
*  has actually seen consolidation. So a lot of these companies that focus only on the pipeline or only [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=246.44s)]
*  on the platform have been frankly struggling. Some have gone away. And now at the time, there's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  actually very few companies in the niche that have reached the level of sustained clinical development. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=257.32s)]
*  And I think we really are leaders now in this area. So we now have this really robust and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=263.56s)]
*  growing pipeline, 31 programs against 29 targets all developed internally with their own AI [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=268.36s)]
*  platform, full platforms. And we consistently publish peer-reviewed papers. So a few times a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=274.04s)]
*  month usually, which is good even for an academic lab. And we've raised really a substantial amount [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=279.48s)]
*  of venture capital as well. I think over $400 million of venture capital to date, a privately [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=284.68s)]
*  held company at the moment as well. And we've also been awarded some really huge accolades. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=290.04s)]
*  So that's our story in a nutshell. I joined about a year ago. I was an academic for a long time in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=293.72s)]
*  this space and I was watching the story from afar and wanted to jump into biotech to be more on the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=299.48s)]
*  commercial side of things. So to be at the cutting edge. And so I'm really excited to be here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=306.12s)]
*  It's an area that, as you've been talking about the history of the company, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=311.16s)]
*  it's not been around for six months. Why is it? Do you think that AI has been news for the last six [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  months and yet it's been around for a lot longer than that? Yeah, that's a really good question. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=322.76s)]
*  I think there's quite a lot of reasons for it. The recent spurts of AI, especially in the last [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  year, there've been quite a few things that have just become a bit more apparent to the public eye. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=336.52s)]
*  Things like expanded use of large language models, especially for chat GPT, vision learning, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=342.52s)]
*  especially in self-driving cars has really expanded as well as VR, not just for the gaming [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=347.96s)]
*  industry, but it also has pretty huge applications in the military as well in drones and other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=353.32s)]
*  similar applications. So I think there've been like really specific applications that have kind [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  of captured people's imagination. And that's been really picked up by the media. Obviously there's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  a lot of money in it as well. I think a lot of it as well is everybody seems to be concentrating on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  understandably to some extent, maybe jobs and the negative ways in which AI might impact people's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=374.6s)]
*  lives in the future. Yet there doesn't seem to be as much concentrating on the kind of thing that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=382.04s)]
*  you're doing where you're helping people through AI. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I tend to be pretty [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=388.12s)]
*  optimistic when it comes to that simply because I know myself and I know a lot of people and when [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  people are more productive, they usually don't lay people off. They hire more so that they can [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=401.24s)]
*  make even more money in areas that aren't yet like automatable. We'll see how it actually pans out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=407.08s)]
*  I mean, we have to just like keep living and being at the forefront, pushing these things along. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=411.88s)]
*  But in terms of really hard problems like drug discovery and development where there's a ton [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=416.04s)]
*  of data, this is not something that humans are very good at. Most drugs fail. Something like 90% [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  fail. If you look at the percentage of things that even make it into clinical trials, it's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=427.0s)]
*  even worse than that. And so there's a ton of data. We have to be able to see patterns that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=431.24s)]
*  humans just can't see clearly. They just can't see. And also there's a lot of sort of repetitious [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=436.36s)]
*  aspect to certain parts of drug discovery and development in terms of data analysis, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=443.08s)]
*  aggregation and building systems that AI can help with as well in terms of efficiency. So [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=447.56s)]
*  it makes sense. AI is kind of built for this. It's just a matter of shaping it in the right [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=452.6s)]
*  way to actually make it effective. You mentioned before some of the platforms [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=457.56s)]
*  and some of the drug discovery that you've been doing. Could you maybe run through some of those? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=462.36s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. I can talk about it really at a high level. So on the software side, and as a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=468.2s)]
*  side note, 80% of what we do resource wise is actually pretty hardcore research and development [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=473.88s)]
*  in labs. We have a fully automated lab, fully robotic lab. And so you showed that is like [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=478.92s)]
*  really cool and everyone should check out on LinkedIn and YouTube. Our CEO loves posting [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=484.44s)]
*  videos of him like dancing to different music with robots. So it's a lot of fun. And the lab [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=488.84s)]
*  itself looks pretty futuristic. But I'm talking about the software side, which is where I personally [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=493.08s)]
*  work. And we have what's called the Pharma AI Suite. And this suite of software is comprised [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=497.64s)]
*  of three different platforms. So we have biology 42, which really focuses on identifying the targets [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=503.48s)]
*  that we're going to develop drugs against and answering biological questions about things like [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=510.92s)]
*  what is the relevance and impact of targeting different parts of biology and different diseases, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=515.08s)]
*  maybe different pathways or specific genes, or the impact of certain drugs on that biology. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=519.96s)]
*  We also have chemistry 42. It's the second component. And this is really focused on making [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=526.12s)]
*  small molecules that are going to be effective in the clinic. So we're thinking about specific [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  properties of those molecules like novelty, potency, metabolic stability, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=537.72s)]
*  drippability and safety. And then we imagine them from scratch. And then we have medicine 42, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  which is really focused on clinical trial design and prediction. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=546.6s)]
*  Is that all about partnerships with industry or do you do the whole process from drug discovery [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=549.88s)]
*  through to the trials? Yeah, great question. So we use this whole platform internally for all of our [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  programs. So we pick our own targets, we design our own drugs. And then when it gets to the point [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=563.56s)]
*  when they're ready to go into the clinic, we usually will partner with people who are actually [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=569.4s)]
*  really, really good at clinical trial design to get them into the clinic and through the next stage. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=574.1199999999999s)]
*  And we've been pretty good at that so far. We have our lead candidate is in phase two. Can't see the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=579.2399999999999s)]
*  data, but things seem to be going well. And we've actually out licensed quite a few of our programs [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=585.9599999999999s)]
*  now. So our first candidate was QPCTL, is in co-development in China with Austin Pharma. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=591.8s)]
*  We have another USP1 that's now licensed by Nanodyslix. And another very recent one was [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=599.0s)]
*  out licensed the Menorini group with the Cat6 target small molecule. And all these are pretty [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  enormous deals. We're talking tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. So it's really great progress. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=609.8s)]
*  Right at the very beginning, how does that work? Is it a company that will come to you and say, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=615.8s)]
*  we're looking to treat disease, whatever, or is it just you looking at the potential for different [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=621.08s)]
*  small molecules and then trying to match that up with companies and diseases? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=627.96s)]
*  Yeah, great question. It is a little bit of both. The map making, it's kind of a magical [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=633.64s)]
*  process that usually happens from both ends. So we have like our public pipeline that we show on [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=638.2s)]
*  our webpage. Anyone can go to that webpage, click on the different molecules that are sort of ready [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=643.48s)]
*  to be discussed with other groups where we have this whole like data room and really extensive [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=649.24s)]
*  lab validation of biological relevance and different properties that we want these small molecules to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=655.32s)]
*  have. And yeah, sometimes other groups that are really great in this clinical trial will come to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=660.92s)]
*  us. That certainly happens a lot, especially for the more popular targets and drugs. And sometimes [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=665.88s)]
*  we go to them. So we'll go out to conferences and networking events and really just look for companies [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=670.92s)]
*  where maybe their mission aligns with what we're trying to do, or maybe they're looking at a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=675.96s)]
*  specific indication that the struggle would be a really great fit for a beta based on the data that [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=679.96s)]
*  we have. And the conversations go from there. So we have whole BD teams kind of spread all throughout [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=683.64s)]
*  the world to do this type of work and they're doing really good work. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=688.6s)]
*  Right at that very beginning in the process, how do you come up with drugs and targets and kind of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=691.96s)]
*  narrow it down? I mean, can you kind of talk me through that process of the beginning to coming [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=700.0400000000001s)]
*  up with something that looks promising? Yeah, absolutely. So picking a drug target is [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=704.76s)]
*  probably the most important part. It's also kind of the first understanding biological relevance, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=710.28s)]
*  understanding what's druggable in a practical sense. These are all like really difficult, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  complicated questions. Otherwise, you know, we'd be a lot better at it. And so early on, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=721.4s)]
*  we have what's called the Panaomics app, which is a part of the biology 42 platform. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=726.68s)]
*  And our general approach at a really high level is to incorporate huge amounts of what are called [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=731.96s)]
*  multiomics data and text data. So by multiomics data, I'm talking about data derived human [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=737.0s)]
*  patients with or without the disease. And the data types would be, for example, microarray, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=743.72s)]
*  RNAC, proteomics, methylomics data, there's a ton of others that we can incorporate into the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=751.08s)]
*  platform as well. And really what we're looking at are at the molecular level, what are all the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=757.4s)]
*  different changes that happen during disease states in the relevant tissues? So you have [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=761.8s)]
*  to leukemia or melanoma or leukemia skin. And we feed all of these into these algorithmic models [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=767.64s)]
*  that we've already trained on huge amounts of data from many different biological disease states. And [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=775.0s)]
*  we've also looked at text data as well, which we think is actually really, really important, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=780.6s)]
*  kind of undervalued by people who maybe aren't as familiar with drug discovery development. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  So the Olmix data gives us really great biological insights. So what is relevant or extremely [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=790.12s)]
*  dysregulated during the disease at the molecular level. But the text data can also be incredibly [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=796.44s)]
*  useful as well. And if you're looking for something, for example, it's really well validated by many [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  different labs and have been published very extensively, then you might want to get something [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=806.84s)]
*  with a really strong text signal. So text data as a signal of novelty or anti-novelty is extremely [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=812.04s)]
*  useful. Very often people will also want to look at the competitive landscape of a given target or [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=818.76s)]
*  indication when they're trying to decide if they want to invest in further. And so that type of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=824.36s)]
*  data is also very, very useful. And therefore we have a bunch of different modules and tools [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=828.1999999999999s)]
*  to explore text data in the context of drug discovery within our software as well. Because [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=832.8399999999999s)]
*  developing a drug, there's sort of the biology of research, but there's also the business side of [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=837.88s)]
*  things. Companies want to make sure that if they pick that target, it's going to fit into [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=842.36s)]
*  their portfolio, that it fits according to their expertise, that it fits into their mission. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=847.4s)]
*  Sometimes there's a variety of other considerations as well. And so we try to incorporate all those [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=851.72s)]
*  factors and make them configurable in the software. And the output is this sort of heat map where [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=855.24s)]
*  every row is a different gene and every column is one of our AI or statistical models that will [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=861.24s)]
*  provide an actual value to rank and sort all of those genes. And in our hands at the top of that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=869.0s)]
*  list, we see somewhere between 5X and 35X enrichment of the best targets at the top of that list. And [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=875.16s)]
*  so then what they can do and what we do is we go through all the genes at the top of that list and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=880.76s)]
*  we do a deep dive into the biology and judge with actual human experts, what is the quality of the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=885.24s)]
*  evidence underlying these scores? And then is this something that we want to move forward with for [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=890.6s)]
*  validation and further development? So usually at that point, there's some kind of validation in a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  lab model just to either validate what's already out there or if it's a really novel target to [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=900.84s)]
*  validate it for the first time. That could be an Invitra model, ex vivo, could be a mouse model, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  really whatever we sort of have at hand. And then once we're really confident, hey, this is the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=910.84s)]
*  target that we want to hit for this particular indication. And actually at Ensilico Medicine, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=915.48s)]
*  we try to find things that will hit multiple indications and specifically that are relevant [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=921.8000000000001s)]
*  to aging as well. But then we take that target and we hand it off to their chemistry 42 team. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=927.16s)]
*  And so they then look at the actual properties of the structure and the actual structure of those. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=932.9200000000001s)]
*  We look at mostly protein targets here at Ensilico and they try to design small molecules that are [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=939.0s)]
*  going to bind to that target in a very specific, selective and strong way to change the biology. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=944.76s)]
*  And there's sort of a lot going on there, kind of behind the scenes, a lot of different modeling, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=952.4399999999999s)]
*  mapping, there's different really generative approaches. So traditionally what people have [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=957.4s)]
*  done at this point is if you have a target, you want to design a drug against it. What a lot of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=962.84s)]
*  people will do is they'll take, it's called like a docking approach. So we have these libraries, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=967.48s)]
*  either previously made molecules or perhaps molecules that could be easily synthesized [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=972.2s)]
*  or in their slight variance. And then on a computer, they'll simulate those molecules binding [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=978.2800000000001s)]
*  to the correct part of the protein. Now this works and has worked in some cases, but when it [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=983.08s)]
*  comes to identifying real novelty, if everyone's fishing in the same tiny pond, they're all going [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  to catch the same fish. And so the power of generative AI is that it can look at the problem [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=993.24s)]
*  and imagine new solutions. So I know in some cases people think about chat GPT and these [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=998.68s)]
*  hallucinations being a problem, but this sort of imaginative ability of AI in this particular space [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1005.0s)]
*  can be extremely useful because it's sort of thinking of things that either haven't been [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1010.28s)]
*  imagined before or that a human wouldn't otherwise come to the conclusion of even trying that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1014.8399999999999s)]
*  and sort of bringing up new ideas that makes things a bit more easily patentable. So that's [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1019.8s)]
*  really important is you want something that you can actually defend from a commercial perspective. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1026.12s)]
*  You want something that is maybe even more effective than what humans would have previously [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1031.56s)]
*  come up with. And so the input to the software at that point, or to our chemistry 42 platform [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1035.7199999999998s)]
*  with the target and then the profile of the molecule that we want to design. So for example, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1041.9599999999998s)]
*  how novel do we want it to be? How potent do we want it to be? How metabolically stable and [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1048.6799999999998s)]
*  drugable? It can also bias for certain safety measures as well. And then it imagines molecules [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1054.6s)]
*  from scratch pretty much indefinitely. So you can run these cycles of imagination as many times as [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  you want and each cycle will generate some number of molecules based on how you configure it. And [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1064.9199999999998s)]
*  then you go into the lab and actually test and validate them. And one of the huge sort of powerful [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1069.56s)]
*  aspects here is that in our hands when we published examples of this, we don't have to screen as many [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  molecules. We don't have to screen these huge libraries and testing thousands to tens of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1079.56s)]
*  thousands. Some other groups have tested even more molecules. And we have one recent example, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1084.36s)]
*  cycle-dependent kinase, I think we see 20, where we only had to screen like a couple dozen molecules [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1089.72s)]
*  to get an animal or a hit. It's just like extremely powerfully binding molecule, which in the long run, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  in terms of the full program, you have to spend less time searching for a good drug. And then the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1101.6399999999999s)]
*  overall cost of the program is a lot less because you're getting to the right answer faster or a [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1107.56s)]
*  really good answer fast. And then at that point, it's really a matter of optimization. So making [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  small changes to the molecule, testing it and validating it in different lab settings, so maybe [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1117.24s)]
*  new mouse models, new in vitro models, ex vivo models, new safety models, whatever the case might [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1123.0s)]
*  be. We also have other modeling software and then we can really start to see, all right, well, how [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1128.04s)]
*  well is this going to perform in the clinic? And that's when we pass it to our clinical team and we [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1133.08s)]
*  start looking for organizations that we can outlicense with. Now, obviously the higher level [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1136.84s)]
*  of validation for a given molecule, the more likely it is a group, an outlicensing group is going to [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  feel confident enough to outlicense that molecule. But on the other hand, the earlier they get in, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1149.0s)]
*  the better deal that they can get, right? So if they wait too long, then everyone's in line and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1153.32s)]
*  that's going to drive the price up. Usually if you wait until phase one trials for safety or phase [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1158.6799999999998s)]
*  two trial for efficacy, if you wait that long, you're probably too late and you're not going to [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1163.4s)]
*  get the best price. But these are the balances that people try to weigh and it really just depends on [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1168.1200000000001s)]
*  the organization you're working with. We hear a lot about targets being undruggable. Is AI helping [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1172.76s)]
*  to alleviate that, but kind of associated with that, are there targets that are still going to [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1179.8000000000002s)]
*  be undruggable regardless? That's a great question. To some extent, this is a little bit philosophical, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1185.72s)]
*  but I'm going to give my opinion here. Undruggable and that the reason for that is [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1193.16s)]
*  undruggable simply means we can't drug it at the moment or seemingly can't drug it at the moment. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1196.68s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that someone has tried or that it can't potentially be [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1202.28s)]
*  drugged if someone did try. But historically, there's specific types of molecules that have [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1207.8000000000002s)]
*  been drugged more often or that have been drugged at all. And so there are different ways to define [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1214.68s)]
*  drugability. I think that sort of blue space is the one that I would propose. There's a lot of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1218.92s)]
*  different things that can make a target quote unquote undruggable. And AI can really help with [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1224.68s)]
*  quite a few of them actually. So first would be sort of structural unavailability. So when a protein [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1230.52s)]
*  is acting in a signaling pathway that is related to the development of a disease, there's usually [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1236.92s)]
*  certain parts of the protein that are involved in that process more than other parts. So if it's an [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1242.68s)]
*  enzyme, there's certain maybe a little pocket that is involved in changing other molecules and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1249.88s)]
*  enabling signaling, for example. So it might be actually the case that the drug target may be [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1256.1200000000001s)]
*  structurally unsuitable for drug binding within that pocket where you want the small molecule to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1262.52s)]
*  bind for chemical reasons. Now, this is really where I think AI has been extremely powerful [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1267.32s)]
*  because of that imaginative ability where previously, the chemists would sit down, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1273.1599999999999s)]
*  they'd look at some structures that people tried before, they'd look at the structure itself, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1277.72s)]
*  they'd try to imagine some things, and they go through and they iterate. They synthesize and [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1281.24s)]
*  test and design and synthesize and test. With AI, you can usually get to an answer much faster. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1285.08s)]
*  Some targets are also a bit more complex in how they're involved in various biological processes [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  where targeting something, it might effectively treat the disease, but it might also, targeting [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1299.24s)]
*  that particular target with a drug may also cause toxicity just by the nature of the fact [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1305.8s)]
*  that that one protein is involved in some really important biological process. And so if you disrupt [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1311.4s)]
*  that biological process, it causes toxicity, but it's also involved in the disease. So proteins can [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1317.32s)]
*  do different things in different contexts. So the problem of safety is something that hasn't quite [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1323.48s)]
*  been cracked yet, but there's quite a few groups working on that. We have a paper in submission on [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1328.6799999999998s)]
*  some new AI-based models where we can predict how much a target is involved in these types of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1333.1599999999999s)]
*  pathways that might cause toxicity if you target them. So that's certainly a question that we can [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1339.56s)]
*  get to, but there's a ton of work that needs to be done there. Another issue is selectivity. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1344.92s)]
*  The drug target may not be unique to the disease-causing cells if it is a certain [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1351.16s)]
*  cell that's causing the disease, so disrupting that target may also affect other healthy cells. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1356.76s)]
*  Even within a certain cell, there may also be other targets that look very similar to the one [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1361.64s)]
*  that you're trying to target. And so coming up with this idea of finding something that's really [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1368.68s)]
*  going to only target what you want to target is really difficult. There's also physical considerations [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1373.0s)]
*  like where inside the cell is the target. Believe it or not, targeting different parts of the inside [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1378.12s)]
*  of a cell can be more or less difficult. Imagine different barriers and walls as you move from the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1384.68s)]
*  outside of the cell into the nucleus. You might have to go through a few different membranes and [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1390.92s)]
*  maybe some different ion channels in order to get to where you want to go to actually have the effect [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1397.72s)]
*  that you want to have. There's a lot of other factors to consider like functional redundancy. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1402.52s)]
*  Sometimes targeting one thing, nature has a way possibly of compensating with another way of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1407.8s)]
*  coming in and causing disease along the same pathway, just not using the target that you're [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1413.8s)]
*  trying to block with your drug. And then there's also drug resistance, where like for example, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1419.1599999999999s)]
*  in cancer. Cancer is a genetic disease and in many different cancers, there's a lot of different [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1426.76s)]
*  sort of heterogeneity that happens there. And so by maybe treating certain groups of cancer cells, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1431.72s)]
*  there's others that can grow and that are only selecting for a subset of those. And in general, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1437.48s)]
*  heterogeneity of diseases is a problem. So just, you know, disease is often classified by how it [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1442.76s)]
*  looks at the patient level and maybe at the molecular level. There are some really major [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1448.84s)]
*  differences between patients that sort of present the same types of problems, but if you treat a [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1453.8s)]
*  group of patients with a drug, maybe only some of those patients will actually respond to that drug [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1459.72s)]
*  because of what's actually causing it at the molecular level. That, you know, isn't really [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1464.9199999999998s)]
*  very clear at the clinical level. So those are a few examples. No, because I was going to say that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1468.9199999999998s)]
*  just because you can find something that will bind to a target doesn't mean, okay, we're done. There's [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1474.68s)]
*  so much more involved. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Biology is extremely complicated. The chemistry [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1481.24s)]
*  is complicated. You know, there's sort of this epidemiology aspect to it as well that can be [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1486.52s)]
*  really tough to overcome. And that's not even mentioning a commercial aspect. Once you have [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1492.2s)]
*  something, even if it's effective, it works in all patients. It's super safe. You know, is it actually [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1497.4s)]
*  going to make money, which is how you actually get it into patients. And I know that we hear a lot [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1501.64s)]
*  about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and also quantum computing. Is quantum computing [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1506.6s)]
*  involved in this and how does that fit in? That's a good question. I think the era of quantum [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  computing, in my personal opinion, hasn't quite reached us yet, but a lot of people are sort of [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1519.7199999999998s)]
*  looking at really what could be the next type of math that could really revolutionize this space. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1525.7199999999998s)]
*  I think some people would even argue that drug discovery and development, AI hasn't really fully [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1532.6s)]
*  had its day yet. If you look at this sort of our niche and Silicon Medicine's niche, most of the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1537.6399999999999s)]
*  AI driven companies are really, really young. And I'm talking about like early 2010s, the mid 2010s, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1544.4399999999998s)]
*  most of them are kind of founded around that time. So if you think about the amount of time it takes [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1554.36s)]
*  to develop a drug and then to get it through more importantly, clinical trials, we haven't really [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1559.24s)]
*  gotten there yet. I think most experts would say that there hasn't really been a drug that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1564.44s)]
*  is fully informed from end to end with AI that has made it fully through clinical trials and [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1570.36s)]
*  it's actually given to patients at this point. I think in Silicon Medicine's in the lead with our [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1576.04s)]
*  lead candidate, but you know, we'll see the race is still on. I think every time our CEO posts [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1580.28s)]
*  anything on LinkedIn, he's actually shown me his analytics before tens of thousands of big pharma, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1587.16s)]
*  I know really important people out there are watching to see what kind of updates he has. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1593.16s)]
*  Is it going to work? Is it not going to work? What are going to be the phase two readouts? Is it [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1598.28s)]
*  effective? Is it safe? And there's other AI driven companies that have their own molecules in the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1602.3600000000001s)]
*  clinic as well at this time. So I think we're all just really waiting to see if that's effective. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1608.28s)]
*  And these early cases could change the minds of investors, of scientists, as far as what is the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1612.6s)]
*  final verdict? Is AI really ready to have the impact that we sort of imagined it would have [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1619.0s)]
*  just a few years ago? In terms of quantum computing, I think this is certainly an area where we are [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1624.44s)]
*  investigating as well. We're an AI driven company because of our expertise, but we certainly have [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1630.12s)]
*  quite a lot of diverse expertise in house. We're trying to think how we take different approaches [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1634.52s)]
*  to answering some of these really basic problems in especially drug design, imagining new molecules, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1639.48s)]
*  simulating binding of drugs to targets, designing new drugs. There's really a lot of really hard [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1646.68s)]
*  problems. And just because we started in one place, we have a certain type of expertise. We [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  don't want to be the guy with the hammer looking for a nail. And so we're really just trying to [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1659.0s)]
*  explore all the different options. I would say that's about as far as I can go with it for now. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1663.64s)]
*  But yeah, I'm excited to see what actually happens if AI will rule the day, if quantum computing will [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1668.2s)]
*  take over next or not. I think it's yet to be seen. Is AI evolving incredibly quickly in terms of [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1673.48s)]
*  what you're doing with drug discovery and what kind of scales of improvement is that making in [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1681.8s)]
*  terms of cost and time? Yeah, that's a great question. So in terms of pre-clinical drug [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1688.04s)]
*  discovery, AI has developed extremely fast and made huge, huge, huge strides. This is all work [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1696.36s)]
*  before the clinic in terms of picking a target, designing especially small molecules, proteins that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1703.1599999999999s)]
*  are like large molecules, other modalities. I think that is still in flux where there's a lot of groups [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1708.76s)]
*  and we're also in this space too doing really great work. But in terms of small molecules, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1714.12s)]
*  traditionally this time period would be five, six, seven years. And that's not even counting [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1719.64s)]
*  possibly decades of work on the target in academia where people have been looking to the biology of [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1726.76s)]
*  different diseases for a very long time and just maybe haven't tried to commercialize it. But if [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1732.0400000000002s)]
*  you're starting from scratch, you want to get ready to have a molecule that's ready to be tested in [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1736.8400000000001s)]
*  the clinic. Some estimates have been around the five, six year mark, ballpark. Whereas with our [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1741.8000000000002s)]
*  lead candidate program, we've been able to go from nothing to something ready to go into the clinic [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1747.24s)]
*  in only 30 months. So that's a pretty huge time savings. And if you look at the cost savings as [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1751.56s)]
*  well, we're talking about like a whole factor of maybe 10 in terms of cost savings. But really, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1757.24s)]
*  most importantly, it's more about getting effective safe drugs to patients faster. So at the end of [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1764.76s)]
*  the day, the ultimate shareholders, right? And there's a lot of barriers in the clinic. And [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1770.44s)]
*  after that, that AI hasn't really made as huge strides on. But in terms of preclinical work, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1776.12s)]
*  it's been absolutely huge. There's papers being published really on a weekly basis in this space. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1782.28s)]
*  As I mentioned, also, most of the participants are still new companies in the grand scheme of things. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1787.9599999999998s)]
*  And so the whole space is really, I would say, still young, up for grabs sort of in the early [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  development cycles. I would argue none of them are really mature yet. And then depending on [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1799.56s)]
*  your modality, like what type of therapy you're developing, it could be entirely new. You might be [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1804.6s)]
*  cutting new grass like every day. Looking at your website, there's an awful lot coming out of your [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1809.32s)]
*  company. And one of the most recent things, I guess, is a partnership with the University [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1817.1599999999999s)]
*  of Toronto. And if you could tell me a little bit about that? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. So we absolutely [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1821.32s)]
*  love working with academics. As an alliance manager, one of the things that I do is sort [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1826.84s)]
*  of manage our collaborations with different academics around the world. We apply for grants [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1832.2s)]
*  with them. We love to co-apply for grants with academics. We do pretty often. And then work on [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1836.6000000000001s)]
*  the project with them when we get the grant. I think they like to work with us because we have [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1841.72s)]
*  the brand, we have the expertise in the space, and we've delivered on so many projects successfully [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1846.04s)]
*  and on time. So we also like to be connected to what is cutting edge in the field and also [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1851.96s)]
*  validating with publications what our models, our algorithms can actually do in real world [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1857.48s)]
*  scenarios, at least like research-based scenarios. So the University of Toronto, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1865.0s)]
*  they do a lot of good work. There's a particular researcher, Igor Stagdar. So he's a molecular [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1870.2s)]
*  geneticist and professor there. We're sort of partnering with him to test the ability [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1875.56s)]
*  of our platform to design molecules against these quote unquote, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1880.9199999999998s)]
*  undruggable targets. So basically just targets that have been out of the reach of these more [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  conventional therapeutics. This lab has developed really fascinating assays to test somewhere around [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1890.4399999999998s)]
*  like 15 to 20 of these undruggable targets as a part of the collaboration. We'll use the platform, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1896.84s)]
*  identify them, and then to design the molecules as well, focusing really in on cancer and specific [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1903.48s)]
*  types of cancer genes and then focusing on those cancer gene products, the proteins that have [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1909.88s)]
*  specific types of protein-protein interactions. So the idea here is that we pick the targets with [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1916.68s)]
*  our platform, we design molecules with our platform, and then we validate them using this [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1921.4s)]
*  technology that this lab has developed for confirming disruption of certain types of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1925.8000000000002s)]
*  protein interactions inside of a cell as opposed to more artificial systems. It makes a lot of [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1931.0s)]
*  sense. It's like a perfect, I think, marriage and a good example of how we can work with [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1937.56s)]
*  academic labs to really develop hypotheses and validate them very quickly for publications, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1942.6799999999998s)]
*  for grants, and really ultimately for real world impact of something that could hopefully treat [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1948.44s)]
*  patients. Obviously everyone's different, but what kind of timescales do you look at from being able [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1954.84s)]
*  to turn this into, I guess, a phase three trial that eventually works with patients? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1961.32s)]
*  Great question. I mentioned the pre-clinical timescale. It's really more on one to two year [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1967.96s)]
*  timescale at this point. I think there's even room for it to get much less than that. My lead [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1973.32s)]
*  candidate, like I said, was 30 months. Once it gets into the labs, there's a whole new set of [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1978.52s)]
*  barriers there that, you know, in silico medicine hasn't really started to tackle at this time. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1983.32s)]
*  As an academic lab, I think a lot of our expertise has been early in the drug discovery process where [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1989.6399999999999s)]
*  we believe the biggest impact in terms of chance of success can come through because when you look [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=1994.76s)]
*  at why do clinical trials fail, focusing in especially on small molecules, there's really [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2000.28s)]
*  two overwhelming reasons. They're not effective and they're not safe. We think that in both of [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2005.8s)]
*  those cases, a lot of these drugs are not effective and or not safe because they're picking [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2013.48s)]
*  the wrong target. They could be picking the wrong target. I mean, they could also design a molecule [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2019.72s)]
*  as either ineffective or unsafe for other reasons as well. So we really wanted to focus on where we [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2025.0s)]
*  can make the biggest impact and where our expertise was as well. Once it gets into the clinic, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2030.28s)]
*  honestly, those timelines have not really changed much from sort of the traditional approaches. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2034.68s)]
*  So we tend to partner with other organizations that have shown the ability to quickly push [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2040.68s)]
*  good molecules through the clinic rigorously in clinical trials. A lot of the inefficiency [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2047.96s)]
*  there has to do with identifying the right patients, sort of organizing the trial, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2052.84s)]
*  getting buy-in from the different organizations that will actually run the trial, things like [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2057.56s)]
*  training all the staff, the doctors that are going to be involved in recording the data and sort of [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2062.52s)]
*  keeping track of the progress of the trials and different randomized and other types of legal and [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2067.88s)]
*  scientific reporting that's required. It's a pretty massive undertaking. And I think the more [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2073.7200000000003s)]
*  you involve people in the process, the more things get mocked down, especially when you have people [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2079.4s)]
*  who, doctors that are really busy, other medical professionals that have a lot on their plate, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2086.84s)]
*  patients that are sick, a lot of really hard problems that I think are more human problems [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  are going to take a little bit longer to address. But getting drugs through phase three, it'll [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2097.3999999999996s)]
*  depend on the indication, right? So some types of diseases are very acute, they happen quickly, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2101.56s)]
*  and you'll be able to tell very quickly does the drug work or not, whether that is a deadly disease [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2107.72s)]
*  or not, it can be acute. It can also be very chronic where some of these diseases take decades. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2112.04s)]
*  Maybe it's a very slow growing tumor or it's a long-term infection or autoimmune disease where [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2118.2s)]
*  the treatment itself may take a couple of years to properly measure is this drug being [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2126.2s)]
*  effective or not and we expect it to take that long. And so a lot of the details do matter of [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2132.6s)]
*  the trial, where it's being held, who's actually running the trial, what type of disease is it, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2137.72s)]
*  what are you actually targeting to really give you an idea how long that's going to take. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2142.8399999999997s)]
*  We're still talking several years here. We're talking four to 10 years. So it's really, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2146.12s)]
*  really hard to say, but we specialize in finding partners that do it quickly because that's [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2150.68s)]
*  it's one of our moniker. And I think down the road, that's really the area where AI could have [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2155.72s)]
*  the biggest impact on delivering drugs faster to patients. Because as of right now, like the [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2161.08s)]
*  last few years, the number of approved drugs isn't increasing because it can only test drugs so fast. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2165.3999999999996s)]
*  There's actually a whole law about this, the E-wounds law. It's like the opposite of [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2173.16s)]
*  Moore's law where over time, approving drugs becomes slower and more expensive over time. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2177.3999999999996s)]
*  You mentioned the work with the University of Toronto is with cancer. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2184.28s)]
*  Are there other indications that you're working on? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2187.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's quite a few. We have a number of collaborations with different academic partners, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2191.32s)]
*  really all around the world at this point. And we have a number of grants that are in submission [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2196.92s)]
*  at the moment, actually. I'm not going to mention ones that are sort of in progress, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2202.52s)]
*  just confidentiality reasons. But if you look at our publication record, you can see we've made [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2206.36s)]
*  pretty huge contributions and done really cool work in ALS and NASH and really a variety of other [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2210.28s)]
*  diseases. And all of our publications are on the website, in silica.com, for those publications, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2216.44s)]
*  and all really sortable by the category. And you can kind of look at those. That's one of the most [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  enjoyable parts of my job is the ability to sort of interact with these researchers, see the latest [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2227.2400000000002s)]
*  cutting-edge work and see how our technology can immediately impact their research programs and [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2232.6000000000004s)]
*  outcomes for eventually for patients. So it's really, really, really fun working with these [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2236.92s)]
*  people. I was an academic myself for about a decade and I've recovered, but still a lot of [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2241.32s)]
*  fun to just get to work with them now from a different perspective. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2245.88s)]
*  I appreciate at the beginning of the podcast, I mentioned the name of Canada's biggest city [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2254.52s)]
*  without saying how it is pronounced there. And most people do call it Toronto. But if you're [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2259.16s)]
*  from there, you're a Torontonian. Anyway, it's not the only place in the world that [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2263.88s)]
*  isn't pronounced the way it looks. Probably an entire podcast episode on that. Anyway, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2269.0s)]
*  AI is here to stay and its impact in biotech is only going to grow. Don't forget to check [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2274.84s)]
*  out the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu. And I hope wherever in the world you are, you have [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2280.76s)]
*  a great week ahead. Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us next time for another Beyond [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7Z7v1OoHk&t=2287.48s)]
