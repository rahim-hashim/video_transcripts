# Making waves in cardiovascular disease treatment
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 94. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. Cytokinetics is a late stage, specialty cardiovascular-biopharmaceutical [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=15.68s)]
*  company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=23.92s)]
*  and next-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  cardiac muscle performance is compromised. This week we have a conversation with the CEO of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=37.6s)]
*  Cytokinetics, Robert Blum, about the company's Afficamton following a phase three clinical trial [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=43.6s)]
*  in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I wanted to get things started if you could tell [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=50.64s)]
*  me a little bit about the origin of the company. Cytokinetics is a company that I started in 1998, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=57.04s)]
*  so over 25 years ago, with an ambition to mine a new area of biology that our founding scientists [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=65.44s)]
*  pioneered in their academic laboratories, and our objective has been to industrialize that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=76.4s)]
*  for potential new medicines. That area of biology is called the cytoskeleton, and it has implication [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=84.4s)]
*  to the mechanical activities of cell behavior, and Cytokinetics has been engaged for these many [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=93.2s)]
*  years in discovery and development of potential new medicines that are modulators of proteins [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=102.08s)]
*  specifically focused to the mechanics of muscle contractility, as could give rise to new medicines [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=110.56s)]
*  that address diseases of muscle weakness and muscle dysfunction. In particular, amongst those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=120.32s)]
*  are potential medicines that we're advancing now in late stage development that address [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=129.84s)]
*  cardiovascular conditions associated with either hyper or hypo contractility of cardiac muscle [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=137.28s)]
*  for diseases of severe cardiovascular weakness. In that particular field, what are the current [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  treatments? So interestingly, despite there being many new advances in cardiovascular medicine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=155.44s)]
*  over recent decades, there are very few of those innovations that tie to cardiac muscle directly. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=162.64s)]
*  Most of the drugs that we use to treat cardiovascular conditions are ones that act [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=171.92s)]
*  secondarily on the heart and more address consequences and symptoms associated with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=178.32s)]
*  cardiovascular disease etiology. So cytokinetics medicines, as we are developing them, are designed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=186.32s)]
*  specifically to modulate the proteins involved in the biomachinery of cardiac muscle, and that would [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=196.32s)]
*  represent a major new advancement for innovation in cardiac disease. We've made good progress [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=205.28s)]
*  in cardiovascular diseases by addressing hypertension, high blood pressure, by addressing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=213.44s)]
*  the formation of blood clots that can be complicating to cardiovascular patients, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=222.4s)]
*  by addressing things like cholesterol that can give rise to risk factors associated with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=228.56s)]
*  cardiac illness. But unfortunately, those have come without accompanying innovations [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=234.64s)]
*  in medicines associated with cardiac muscle itself, and that's where hopefully cytokinetics [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=241.76s)]
*  can make a meaningful impact. Do you have any information or stats on the prevalence of heart [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=248.48s)]
*  disease and what your work will hopefully mean for people with some of these conditions? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  Certainly. So cardiovascular disease still represents, despite those innovations, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  the number one killer, the number one disease for highly prevalent populations that is associated [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=269.36s)]
*  with mortality. It's also the number one reason why people are hospitalized, especially those [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=277.76s)]
*  over the age of 65 in the United States and also outside the United States. Heart failure [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=285.04s)]
*  is the number one reason why patients are hospitalized, and those patients are often [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  hospitalized, discharged, readmitted again, again, and again, and that makes heart failure [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  the leading cause of not only hospitalization, but is also associated with the leading economic [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  burden societally for those patients. So it represents a major opportunity where new [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=315.36s)]
*  cardiovascular medicines could be welcomed, not just simply for the benefit of clinical evidence [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=323.44s)]
*  to support better quality of life and functional life, but also as could be for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=330.56s)]
*  the costs associated with healthcare, a major opportunity for economic savings. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=337.84s)]
*  I wonder if we could kind of turn to your current pipeline now, starting with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=344.56s)]
*  Afficampton. What is it and how does it work? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=349.52s)]
*  Afficampton is a small molecule, synthetic organic compound discovered by our scientists [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  that binds directly to cardiac myosin. That's the enzyme or engine of cardiac muscle contractility, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  and it has been associated with the inhibition of cardiac myosin, preventing it from driving [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=373.68s)]
*  cardiac contractility and as is especially important for those patients who have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=383.92s)]
*  hypercontractal cardiac muscle, meaning that their cardiac muscle is excessively contracted, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=392.08s)]
*  and by inhibiting cardiac myosin, the therapeutic hypothesis is to suppress the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=401.2s)]
*  hypercontractility, relax the cardiac muscle, and in that way address the symptoms and the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  potential downstream clinical burden of that disease. These patients have what is called [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=417.84s)]
*  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So Afficampton is being studied for the treatment of both [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=426.32s)]
*  obstructive and non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and it's been the subject of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=433.68s)]
*  a positive phase three clinical trial called Sequoia HCM that we top lined by press release [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=441.44s)]
*  in December 2023, and we're very excited. Next week, Monday, May 13, we're going to be [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=449.84s)]
*  presenting the data from that study at the European Heart Failure Meetings in Lisbon. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  That'll be the first opportunity for the scientific and medical community to see the data from Sequoia, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  and Sequoia will be the subject of three late-breaking clinical trial presentations [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=472.64s)]
*  on that day. We also expect many more presentations and publications from the ongoing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=479.44s)]
*  clinical trials of Afficampton this year, with focus both to obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=486.88s)]
*  and further advancement and expansion of our development program this year. In fact, this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=495.2s)]
*  morning, we announced the start of another clinical trial of Afficampton in patients who [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=501.6s)]
*  are pediatric with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and we also have two other [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=509.04s)]
*  ongoing phase three studies, another one in obstructive HCM and one in non-obstructive HCM. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=515.36s)]
*  So this is for us a broad development program for what we believe Afficampton can be next in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  class and potential best in class treatment physician choice for patients with hypertrophic [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=531.36s)]
*  cardiomyopathy. How is it administered and how often does it need to be administered? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=537.84s)]
*  So that's one of the wonderful things. As it is a synthetic organic compound, it can be administered [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=543.92s)]
*  orally once a day. That's excellent. Where are you at currently with the pathway towards this becoming [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=549.76s)]
*  commercially available? So we are engaging now with regulatory authorities with emphasis to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=558.32s)]
*  the FDA in the United States and EMA in Europe. Our plan is to be submitting an NDA with the FDA [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=566.48s)]
*  in the United States in Q3 of this year and an MAA to EMA in Europe in Q4 this year. So the goal [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=577.84s)]
*  is to have these regulatory submissions in place this year in the second half of this year 2024 [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=588.16s)]
*  as could be enabling of potential approvals and making these medicines available to patients [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=595.76s)]
*  next year 2025. What will that mean for patients? Is this something that they would have to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=602.16s)]
*  take for the rest of their life or is there any benefit for early intervention with your treatment? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=608.88s)]
*  Very good question. So the patients who currently have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have few [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=614.88s)]
*  treatment options and they live with a heavy symptom burden as well as a lot of anxiety [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=620.08s)]
*  associated with their disease. The symptom burden manifests itself primarily in terms of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=627.84s)]
*  breathlessness and inability to exercise and a compromised quality of life and functional life. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=634.32s)]
*  So we hope if approved, Afficampton could be available to these patients to address those [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=642.48s)]
*  matters and in particular in the clinical trial, Sequoia HCM, Afficampton was associated with a [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=649.44s)]
*  clinically meaningful improvement in exercise capacity and stamina as well as improvements in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=656.96s)]
*  measures of quality and functional life. So a medicine like this could become a good [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  alternative to the existing treatments that include surgery as well as other approved [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=670.08s)]
*  medicines that really haven't been demonstrated to have evidence of support in this indication. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=677.6s)]
*  It would be expected that these patients would start on Afficampton and continue on Afficampton [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  indefinitely and one of the things we're studying in longer term extension studies is that the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=691.44s)]
*  longer term extension studies of Afficampton is the potential of remodeling in this disease, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=698.16s)]
*  remodeling of the anatomy as demonstrated echocardiographically and that could speak [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  if demonstrated in these longer term studies to a reversal of the pathophysiology that contributes [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  to this disease and that could be very, very exciting as well. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=722.24s)]
*  The presentations that you're giving in Portugal next week, are you able to tell us anything about [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=725.12s)]
*  those? Just that they will elaborate on the data as already press released and we believe that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  they will be reinforcing and reassuring of what we believe to be a next in class profile [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=740.56s)]
*  for cardiac myosin inhibition in this disease and we are hopeful that they will be embraced [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=747.92s)]
*  and welcomed by the medical community as could become a new standard of care in this disease. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=755.04s)]
*  Are there any other areas where Afficampton could potentially make a positive impact? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I mentioned we're studying it not just in obstructive HCM but now also non-obstructive HCM [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=769.28s)]
*  and we expect to have two other studies reading out one in 2025, one in 2026 [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=776.96s)]
*  in obstructive and non-obstructive HCM respectively and those could be enabling [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  of Afficampton to reach a broader array of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=791.76s)]
*  Just this morning we announced also that a compound that is similar to Afficampton but with a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=798.88s)]
*  distinct mechanism of action, a compound called CK586 is advancing from phase one to phase two. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=807.92s)]
*  CK586 like Afficampton is a cardiac myosin inhibitor but it binds to a different site in myosin [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  has different properties and may lend itself differently pharmacologically. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=827.52s)]
*  It's being studied in an adjacent indication to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that indication [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=834.0s)]
*  is called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and heart failure represents as I [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=840.88s)]
*  mentioned earlier a much larger prevalent population in the United States over five [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=848.16s)]
*  million patients with heart failure in comparison to a few hundred thousand with hypertrophic [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=855.28s)]
*  cardiomyopathy and we're looking at heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=862.72s)]
*  which represents about half of that prevalent population of heart failure and a subset of those [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=868.64s)]
*  patients have hypercontractility that resembles in profile similar to non-obstructive [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=875.76s)]
*  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So we're going to be advancing into phase two later this year [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=884.4s)]
*  CK586 as a potential treatment for those patients with heart failure and preserved [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=891.36s)]
*  ejection fraction who similar to patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=898.16s)]
*  have high ejection fractions hypercontractility and where they too could benefit from symptom relief [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=905.76s)]
*  and addressing of their underlying cardiac myosin disorder. So we do believe that with this [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=914.96s)]
*  announcement this morning we're further expanding our pipeline and reach of this biology this [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  innovative new pharmacology to a new patient population and that speaks to our corporate [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=930.24s)]
*  strategy as is rooted in this biology and expanding to more of these diseases of severe [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  cardiovascular dysfunction but for where we believe from a business standpoint there are [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=946.0s)]
*  good synergies economic efficiencies and that should be enabling of us to build [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=953.52s)]
*  a more valuable sustainable cardiovascular specialty franchise business. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=959.76s)]
*  You'd mentioned CK586 I wonder if you could tell me something about CK136? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=966.56s)]
*  CK136 is an activator of cardiac troponin. Troponin is a regulator of cardiac myosin [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=973.68s)]
*  and CK136 looks to have promise as could be enabling of augmenting cardiac function in [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  patients where that's compromised. That's in phase one evaluation now for potential [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=993.28s)]
*  progression to phase two. We haven't yet analyzed those data to make any determination about the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1000.0s)]
*  advancement of CK136. If you could tell me something about Omicamtev McCarbel? Yes Omicamtev McCarbel [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1007.36s)]
*  is a cardiac myosin activator. Think of it as the flip side of the cardiac myosin inhibitor [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1016.4s)]
*  and we studied it in over 30 clinical trials to assess its potential to treat heart failure [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1024.56s)]
*  with reduced ejection fraction where the biomachinery of cardiac muscle is compromised [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1032.56s)]
*  and the therapeutic hypothesis is to activate cardiac myosin to increase cardiac performance [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1040.4s)]
*  for those patients. It was the subject of a positive phase three study called Galactic [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  and that study was the subject of a regulatory application for potential approval but for which [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  the FDA indicated that while positive they would like to see a confirmatory study. We are still in [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1064.48s)]
*  the process of assessing what would be potential next steps with Omicamtev McCarbel. We've not made [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1072.0s)]
*  any commitments to this point. Still plenty to do then other than FECampton. There's still lots on [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1079.6s)]
*  your plate. Yeah we believe that we have architected and are executing on a plan [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1086.24s)]
*  for an uncommon specialty cardiovascular company. I say that because there are companies in the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1094.24s)]
*  biopharmaceutical space that have been focused to cardiology but not a specialty model and by a [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1101.84s)]
*  specialty model I mean for which we believe we've got several advancing programs in development [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1109.04s)]
*  that would be all directed to the same concentrated customer segment enabling of us a rapidity of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  potential product approvals and potential medicines directed to the same opportunities [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1126.48s)]
*  in a way that would enable a high return on R&D investment, a high return on sales and marketing [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1133.84s)]
*  investment and therefore a high return on shareholder equity and we believe this is the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1142.0s)]
*  path to building a sustainable enduring company as could be rewarding to shareholders and at the same [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1148.4s)]
*  time deliver on the promise of our science for potential benefit to more and more cardiovascular [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1155.84s)]
*  patients. As we're embarking on this strategy we believe that we're in an advantage position to go [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1163.1999999999998s)]
*  to market ourselves in North America and also Europe but to do so in a gated prudent way. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  Ours is a company that has been a good student of those companies that have preceded us and [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1179.1999999999998s)]
*  those that have built specialty care franchise models. We think we can do that in the cardiovascular [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1185.52s)]
*  space but we also recognize limitations and we will seek partners in certain geographies. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  We're diversifying our access to capital to ensure that we deploy capital in the most efficient way [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1200.72s)]
*  and I think our R&D strategies, our corporate and business development strategies have enabled us [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1208.4s)]
*  to build a very valuable company, valuable to patients as well as shareholders and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1215.36s)]
*  we look forward to further advancements along those dimensions. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1221.6s)]
*  Lots of great progress there from cytokinetics in treating heart disease. Don't forget to check out [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E77xmiGAFSs&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
