Video Description: Pentixapharm is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical development company targeting a range of diseases. 


While it is currently owned by the Eckert & Ziegler Group, it will soon be spun off as a separate company. Pentixapharm’s clinical pipeline includes PENTIXATHER, am Yttrium-90 based therapeutic against CNS lymphoma, and PENTIXAFOR, a Gallium-68 based companion diagnostic. Additionally, PENTIXAFOR is being developed as a diagnostic tool for primary aldosteronism (PA), a significant cause of hypertension.


Recently, the company announced the acquisition of the target discovery business of Glycotope.


The deal includes a portfolio of preclinical antibodies against multiple oncology targets that can be developed into radiopharmaceuticals. It also includes Glycotope’s laboratories, cell banks, tumor target data base, and the equipment needed to exploit the discovery platform, along with a range of patents, licenses, and other tangible assets. 


This week, we had a conversation with Andreas Eckert, founder and chairman of the supervisory board at Pentixapharm.

# New German biotech spins out to develop radiotherapeutics
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 107. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=16.2s)]
*  This week we're talking to the company Pentixxer Farm, which is about to be spun off from the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Eckert and Siegler Group, and we'll be talking about its pipeline and its recent acquisition [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=25.7s)]
*  of the Target Discovery business of Glycotope. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=31.5s)]
*  Pentixxer Farm is a clinical stage biotech company discovering and developing novel targeted [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=35.62s)]
*  radiopharmaceuticals against a range of diseases. To tell us about the company and its work [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=41.7s)]
*  is Andreas Eckert, founder and chairman of the supervisory board at Pentixxer Farm. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=48.74s)]
*  Okay, so I guess if we could get started with a bit of information on the upcoming spinout [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=55.38s)]
*  of Pentixxer Farm. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=64.1s)]
*  Yeah, Pentixxer Farm is currently a subsidiary of Eckert and Siegler and Eckert and Siegler [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=65.7s)]
*  is a company which provides other pharmaceutical companies with radioisotopes. It always held [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=70.86s)]
*  subsidiaries, startups, has always funded and supported startups because Eckert and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  Siegler sees most of these things earlier than Novartis or Bayer because the academicians [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=82.02s)]
*  or the inventors come to us when they need a lab and they need to play around with the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=88.38s)]
*  mice and that led to Eckert and Siegler always funding these guys. Pentixxer Farm in a way [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=93.02s)]
*  has the same background, but Pentixxer Farm is a company where success was more than anticipated. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  Pentixxer Farm works on the CXCF4 receptor and that receptor has been thoroughly researched, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=105.74s)]
*  you could say, by a lot of academicians and not just researched, but it had been also tested. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=112.82s)]
*  There were more when we got hands on the asset there, more than a thousand patients had already [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=117.14s)]
*  been treated under compassionate use programs or similar things like that. And the management [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=122.72s)]
*  just said, well, let's tabulate all these kinds of things, put them together and go [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=129.1s)]
*  to the registrator and ask them, do we really need to start with the mice and then with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=133.18s)]
*  the volunteers and all that thing? Can we not right away jump in a phase three? And [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=137.82s)]
*  the EMIA said yes. And that leads to the spin-off because Eckert and Siegler as a provider of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=142.38s)]
*  radiopharmaceuticals does not want to compete with its customers. It is a strategic dilemma [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=147.14s)]
*  you have if you want to sell radioisotopes to the industry, be it Actinium or be it other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=152.66s)]
*  things, you don't want to have a little portfolio on the side where you have pretty much target [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=157.82s)]
*  similar things as the pharma customers that you have. So that led to the decision about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  a year ago to separate, to do a spin-off. And I'm the founder, longtime chairman, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=168.16s)]
*  longtime CEO and chairman of Eckert and Siegler. And I was entrusted together with Hakeem, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=175.72s)]
*  my CEO there to lead this transition or the spin-off. And that's where we are currently. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=180.2s)]
*  So what would be in Pentixafarm's existing pipeline before we get to talking about the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=187.48s)]
*  glycotope transaction? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the Pentixafarm pipeline is focused around the CXC4 receptor. It has a global [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=197.32s)]
*  right to use this receptor as a target for radiopharmaceuticals. And that leads itself [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=203.88s)]
*  to two types, therapeutics and diagnostics. And on the diagnostic side, Pentixafarm, to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=208.84s)]
*  some extent, by surprise, is in a situation whereby it has the green light and actually [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=215.28s)]
*  an open phase three trial in Europe with the EMA. And we had a type C meeting with the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=219.88s)]
*  FDA recently, and they gave us green light to do the same compound, go with that in the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=225.12s)]
*  United States in a different indication. So we have two phase three assets there as an [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=231.44s)]
*  advanced clinical asset. And we're going to go, of course, with these assets, because, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=238.84s)]
*  as you know, pharmaceutical development is the Iron Man of product development, takes [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=243.6s)]
*  years and costs money. But if you have a phase three asset, you can pretty much calculate [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=248.2s)]
*  that within two or three years, you should be able to reach the promised land of market [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  access or market entry. And in the diagnostics, it's even more favorable because nuclear [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=258.04s)]
*  diagnostics, you've seen the pictures, you've seen them in phase two, phase one. And so [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=264.04s)]
*  it's unlikely the mode of action is understood. It's unlikely that you will fail. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=267.64s)]
*  So Pentixa has these two assets in a really interesting indication. It also has a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=272.88s)]
*  therapeutics, the same ligand to seek CR4. And it turns out that is an excellent target for a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  whole range of hematoconcological indications. And Pentixa Pharmacy is developing that. It [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=286.24s)]
*  has started and initiated and is open now a phase one to a trial where we do a dose [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=291.96s)]
*  finding and we will go the usual path with that, use the diagnostic as a companion diagnostic [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=298.04s)]
*  for the therapeutic. And they're pretty optimistic that this is also a very attractive [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  compound because there isn't much really in radiopharmaceuticals or in general for people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=310.6s)]
*  who suffer from leukemias or myelomas. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=315.56s)]
*  Could you explain a little bit about the CXCR4 ligand approach? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=319.04s)]
*  Yeah, the ligand appears on a broad range of malignancies. It's highly specific and in the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=324.44s)]
*  hematoconcological or hematopoietic system, it is over expressed on the blood cells. It's an ideal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  target. Because when you go there with a radioisotope, you pretty much wipe out almost [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  all of your tumor cells. And in the context of hematoconcological indications, you would also [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=345.56s)]
*  in any case have a replacement of your bone marrow. It works double that it does the carving [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=352.28s)]
*  out at the same step as it does the killing of the cancer cells. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=357.32s)]
*  And could you tell me a bit about the development plans for your lead compound in primary [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=362.2s)]
*  aldosteronism? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=367.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. I love it because it's the exciting little thing. You know, what excited us [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  about the CXCR4 is that we're taking a completely new territory. We're going after hypertension. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, the story is a little complex. Hypertension needs a few explanations, but it basically [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=379.84s)]
*  goes like that. One major cause of hypertension is the malfunctioning of the adrenal glands. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=384.64s)]
*  They oversecrete aldosterone. And that gives you all the problem, blood pressure raises, and then [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=391.44s)]
*  the follow on diseases, which you know, it's just heart attacks and all these by factor two or three, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=396.64s)]
*  these people suffer from that. Now, if your glands, your adrenal glands malfunction, you can belong to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=402.32s)]
*  two groups, the lucky one and the unlucky one. The lucky one, it's just one gland malfunctioning. The [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=410.56s)]
*  other one is completely normal. And in this case, the surgeon could with a small operation take out [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=416.16s)]
*  one gland or ablate it, the little knots which secrete the aldosterone. And the other one or [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=421.44s)]
*  the remaining one would pretty much take over and you would go back to complete biomedical [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=426.88s)]
*  normalization. This is not really used at the moment, although you could use it on a large [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=431.36s)]
*  number of hypertension patients because it's very difficult not to see whether you have a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=437.28s)]
*  higher level of aldosterone, but whether you have a unilateral or bilateral case of primary [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  hyper aldosteronism. Unilateral, just one. Bilateral, both glands are affected. And the only way, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=448.88s)]
*  the gold standard to find out whether one or two glands are affected today is the biopsy, which is [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=455.44s)]
*  called adrenal vein sample. They have to take a catheter, you go on the kidney, you go around the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  curve, you have to take a little sample here, take the whole thing out, go in the other kidney [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=465.36s)]
*  around the curve into the other gland, take another sample and measure the gradient. If one is eight [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=469.68s)]
*  and one is two, then you have a unilateral case. If one is two and one is two, then you may have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=475.12s)]
*  a bilateral one. It could be eight and eight. The fact is you need the guy or the girl with the golden [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=480.64s)]
*  hands to do these kind of biopsy. And that's a real bottleneck. So endocrinologists don't have a way [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=486.8s)]
*  to do as many of these diagnostics as they want. They are a long waiting list. And basically, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=492.8s)]
*  our new compound promises to substitute that by a simple PET scan. So that's what makes it exciting. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=498.48s)]
*  Exciting is that you have a real high dark field in this area. If you look at the statistics on [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=504.88s)]
*  hypertension and how much is it related to PA, it's not so much. If you talk to people who [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=510.8s)]
*  are at special treatment centers who treat therapy resistant hypertension patients, they say truck [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=516.32s)]
*  loads of patients and the estimates run as high between three and 15 million scans would be [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=522.24s)]
*  advisable in the US and Europe. Is it quick and cheap? Yes, you're getting at the point. Quick and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=529.04s)]
*  cheap. Quick definitely. It's an injection. The patient comes there. You get injected. You wait [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=535.36s)]
*  for half an hour until the thing distributes in your body. And then you get into the normal PET [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=539.6s)]
*  scanner. And they go out. And then you have the picture and you can say, is it unilateral? Does [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=544.32s)]
*  it warrant an operation or are you the unlucky one and you have to continue to take all kind [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=550.4s)]
*  of medication your lifelong, which has still serious side effects. So there is no easy medication. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  Cheap. Yes, that's a good and a bad thing. It's a good thing if you talk about providers and payers. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  Of course, if you talk about investors and you talk pharmacy, the current image of a diagnostic [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=567.6s)]
*  is something it's kind of money. It's stuff with whom you can't make money. But that is not true. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=573.36s)]
*  If you look at the lengthiest, for example, here in the last two or three years, they've built [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=580.24s)]
*  from scratch from eight million in Q3 2021, Pilarify into something which has now in the US [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=584.88s)]
*  just revenues and more than a billion dollar. And that is without even taking into account [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=592.16s)]
*  Telex and all the other ones who are also providing for that and European sales on that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=597.36s)]
*  And then we see a clear trend to use nuclear diagnostics to widen them out. And in a way, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=602.32s)]
*  it works for us if you have a large indication like hypertension, where you can provide an [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=608.64s)]
*  essential benefit to the patient. There will be a willingness of payers also to support it. And we [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=613.28s)]
*  are fine if these things are not hundred thousand euros dollars a treatment cost per year. The volume [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  will make the thing attractive. Right. And I guess any time that you start to talk about economics, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=625.52s)]
*  it's a little bit difficult because there are so many factors involved. There's insurance and how [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=632.0s)]
*  many people that you can help and savings with future treatment and that kind of thing. So it's [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=637.92s)]
*  a much bigger picture than it at first could seem. Absolutely. Absolutely. But it makes it exciting [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=644.0s)]
*  because it also one can always think pessimistic. It's very small. It's this kind of a niche [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=650.4799999999999s)]
*  diagnostics nobody wants. It won't be like that. If you look at the economics, it's much cheaper [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=657.12s)]
*  to do a scan. Now you have an operation with the operating suit and an evasive procedure and you [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=664.56s)]
*  have all kinds of patients go off medication, all these kind of things to do that. In terms of costs, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=669.92s)]
*  it definitely beats the biopsy. In terms of OSHA rules, actually it's true because radiologists [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=675.52s)]
*  who have to do the procedure, they have to do it in a CT. So you save exposure there. It's an [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=681.84s)]
*  interesting case in so far if you talk US environment that hypertension is de facto much [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=687.76s)]
*  more prevalent in minorities. Although we don't seem to think of it, hypertension is a disease [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=694.64s)]
*  which affects these subgroups much more. And if you add all of that, it actually makes a very [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=700.48s)]
*  interesting case. Could you tell me a little bit about glycotopes operations and pipeline and [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=705.84s)]
*  glyco targets? Well, glycotope, I'm the founder. I'm one of the co-founders of glycotope. In 2004, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=711.28s)]
*  we founded it. And then when in Germany, the capital market crashed after the Neumarkt, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=719.12s)]
*  we had to look for different finances and went to Thomas Strunemann and the Arthos Group, which [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=725.28s)]
*  is the financing behind, among others, Biontech. And we developed together a glycotope there on [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=730.4s)]
*  the idea that the glycosylation of proteins has a pharmacokinetic effect. It turned out that the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=736.4s)]
*  effect is not as large as we hoped, but we only found out after we burned almost 200 million dollars. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=741.68s)]
*  And since then, glycotope has changed its business model into developing antibody, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=747.28s)]
*  very specific antibodies, and licensing out to pharma companies who would then link to that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=751.76s)]
*  toxin or use it for monological concepts. The naked antibody is never the thing itself. They [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=757.36s)]
*  would add something. So we have a deal with Daichiya, which is working on antibodies there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=764.56s)]
*  The problem with glycotope has been that the business of licensing out naked antibodies [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=769.92s)]
*  is a hard one. You have to license out, they have to work on it a couple of years, and that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=774.7199999999999s)]
*  the feedback isn't any more there. So the decision was on the glycotope partners to change [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=779.04s)]
*  the business model. And that opened an opportunity for Pentixa, who now does not want to sell anybody [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=786.0s)]
*  a license for an antibody, but they would also for its own pipeline of radiotherapeutics. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=792.08s)]
*  That's a group of people who know a lot about selecting targets with a high sensitivity, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  with low cross reactivities, with highly specific and all these things. And we just took the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  opportunity to take the team in there and, if you say from a standalone profit center, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=808.48s)]
*  which it was in glycotope, it becomes a cost center in the development department. And it will help [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=816.72s)]
*  us to go beyond CXC4 into the next generation. The beauty of it is that the know-how which we [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=821.92s)]
*  have up here is not limited to the oncological target, but to a whole range of other ones. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  We like the idea that to extend radiopharmaceuticals to other indications, there's a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=833.76s)]
*  lot of precedents where it works, for example, very nicely in rheumatoid arthritis and these [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=839.04s)]
*  kind of things. There's a long tradition of treating that. So the people which came from [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=844.24s)]
*  glycotope are now helping us to fill, if you want, the pipeline. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=847.52s)]
*  How synergistic were those two businesses? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=852.48s)]
*  As synergistic as we have, the CXC4 is a small molecule peptide. If you want antibody as animals [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=855.52s)]
*  in itself, you have to do all this run. So on the technical side, currently there are not many [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=862.88s)]
*  synergies, but the Pentixav team has all the know-how of chelating the vehicles which you do [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=869.76s)]
*  it has a lot of experience with radioisotopes and radioisotope supply chains and the labs and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=877.28s)]
*  the synergy comes there. I'm not sure how much detail you can go into on the acquisition itself, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=882.88s)]
*  but was that the entire company or just a portion of the company? It's a good part of the technical [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  people and we also were lucky that the change of the business model there led to that we have a [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=896.16s)]
*  administrative core which due to the fact that glycotope was a large company, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=902.0s)]
*  included an SAP system and for a smaller startup like Pentixavarm that's perfect because if we go [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  for and become a public company, the requirements which you have up there are much larger than the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  requirements that you have if you're private. It's a win-win for both companies and they're [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=919.44s)]
*  close in proximity. We can make facilities, they're all on the same campus here in Berlin. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=925.2s)]
*  Couldn't have been worked better. Will out licensing still be a major feature given glycotopes [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=930.64s)]
*  previous work or do you plan on doing your own clinical trials? We do our own clinical trials. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=936.56s)]
*  The key for Pentixavarm is the clinical team in radiopharmaceutical. I also think that in terms of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=942.16s)]
*  the enormous amount of money which has been pouring into the radiopharmaceutical space in the last [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=948.16s)]
*  years and it's in VC money and you've seen the deals when large corporations stepped in, Novartis [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=953.28s)]
*  has bought, Elilili has bought, everybody is in there and it's billion dollar deals that will lead [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=960.16s)]
*  somewhere down the road it will consolidate the industry and then they all will look for pipeline. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=965.12s)]
*  They will all look for content. So we're going to focus Pentixavarm on that. I'm not going to, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=969.68s)]
*  we'd be very unlikely to have 50 sales guys out there in Scotland or anywhere. It's a research [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=974.8s)]
*  focus. It's clinical team and research that will be the focus. So how do you see the future for [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=982.0s)]
*  Pentixavarm and your new increased portfolio? I see the future is bright like always. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=989.68s)]
*  We will look at the spin out, organize it. We have to go through all kinds of commotions, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=997.76s)]
*  the regulations, the la la la, the German SEC, the tra la la here and there and then [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1003.84s)]
*  what we do, we have as the last milestone, we had the approval of the spin off by the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1009.6s)]
*  shareholder meeting of Ekadent Siegler. We go and we will push it in there and actually [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1015.04s)]
*  we are the masters of our destiny because the spin off is different than a full-fledged IPO. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1020.48s)]
*  Any shareholder of Ekadent Siegler one morning should wake up and have a second [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1026.08s)]
*  share of a different company in the portfolio. We'll put that push ahead and then Pentixavarm [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1030.16s)]
*  will have to show the phase three things that will take two or three years but every the capital [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1036.88s)]
*  markets will watch. Can they deliver? I'm optimistic they will deliver. By then we have the phase [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1040.8000000000002s)]
*  two data from the therapeutic and we'll hopefully be able to commence phase two B that would give [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1046.0800000000002s)]
*  us the pivotal data on does it really as a therapeutic have meaningful clinical endpoint? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1052.5600000000002s)]
*  Does it increase survival or other things like that? And if you have these data, that's more [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1057.5200000000002s)]
*  most likely the injunction point where we would look for deals and by then I also hope that the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1063.92s)]
*  pipeline of these antibodies and the glycotopes have a whole firework of interesting targets. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1068.64s)]
*  Definitely an interesting company doing some very exciting work in the radio pharmaceuticals field. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-8mLIQJ5E&t=1079.28s)]
