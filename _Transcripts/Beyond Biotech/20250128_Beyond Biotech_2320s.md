Video Description: While our podcast takes a brief break, Labiotech invites you to enjoy some of our favorite episodes. We will return with a brand-new episode on August 16, 2024! Have an awesome summer!

Artificial intelligence (AI) is certainly in the news constantly; however, it’s been used in drug discovery for some time.


A new collaboration between artificial intelligence drug discovery company Insilico Medicine and University of Toronto biochemist and molecular geneticist Igor Stagljar will test AI-designed molecules against "undruggable" cancer targets. 


The research will test 15 to 20 undruggable targets - but are they undruggable? And how does AI work in the drug discovery process?


This week, we have a conversation with Kyle Tretina, Alliance Manager of AI Platforms at Insilico Medicine, on a wide range of subjects including drug discovery, undruggable targets, the collaboration with the University of Toronto, and more.


00:58-05:11: About Insilico Medicine
05:11-06:09: Why is AI in the news?
06:09-07:39: Helping people through AI
07:39-09:10: What is Insilico Medicine doing with AI?
09:10-10:15: Does Insilico Medicine take drugs from idea to trials?
10:15-11:32: How do your partnerships come about?
11:32-19:34: How does drug development start with AI?
19:34-24:43: Can AI address undruggable targets?

# [Rebroadcast] How does AI assist drug discovery?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI)
*  Hello, while our podcast takes a well-earned brief summer break, LaBioTech invites you to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=0.0s)]
*  enjoy some of our favourite episodes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=18.04s)]
*  We'll return with a brand new episode on August 16th. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=20.68s)]
*  In the meantime, have an awesome summer, and we hope you enjoy these favourite episodes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=26.12s)]
*  This week we have a very interesting look, or a guest listen, at the world of artificial [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=33.44s)]
*  intelligence and its use in drug discovery. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=39.08s)]
*  The company in Silicomedicine is collaborating with the University of Toronto to test AI-designed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=42.56s)]
*  molecules against undruggable cancer targets. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=48.92s)]
*  And I appreciate if you're from there you don't call it Toronto, having lived there [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=52.92s)]
*  for many years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=56.6s)]
*  To tell us all about artificial intelligence and drug discovery is Kyle Tratina, Alliance [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=58.0s)]
*  Manager of AI Platforms at Ensilico Medicine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  And I'll let him do the introductions to both himself and the company. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=68.62s)]
*  I'm Kyle Tratina, Alliance Manager here at Ensilico Medicine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=73.12s)]
*  That basically means that I manage our projects with Big Pharma, Biotech and Academics. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=76.44s)]
*  My background, my PhD was in infectious disease and using multi-omex technology to answer [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=81.56s)]
*  questions in that area. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=86.36s)]
*  I've been with the company for about a year, Boston-based, but the company goes back actually [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=88.4s)]
*  really far compared to sort of the age of this field where there's been a recent insurgence [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=92.92s)]
*  of AI and drug discovery and development. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=97.48s)]
*  We really clocked back to 2014, where we started really as an academic group. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=100.64s)]
*  So our founder, Alex Shevrinkov, started his lab at Johns Hopkins in 2014. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=106.96s)]
*  Funny enough, I was actually getting my PhD at the same time just on the other side of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=111.04s)]
*  Baltimore. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=115.36s)]
*  We might've passed each other in a hallway at some point and I didn't realize at the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=116.36s)]
*  time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=119.12s)]
*  And at that time, him and his lab were really focused on developing algorithms that could [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=120.36s)]
*  make drug discovery faster and more successful. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  So him and his group wrote some really, really, really clever breakthrough stuff, especially [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=132.04s)]
*  in generative adversarial networks along those lines and founded the company in 2014. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=136.8s)]
*  So early on, we were a service-based company. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=142.76s)]
*  So essentially starting collaborations with Big Pharma and some biotechs in the area and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=146.96s)]
*  then more regionally as well for drug development projects. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=152.8s)]
*  So things like identifying targets for drugs, designing new drugs were really a lot of our [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=156.48s)]
*  common use cases. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And then as an academic group, they needed academic government funding for a lot of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=165.16s)]
*  early work, but transitioning to really focus on the company in the few years following [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=171.2s)]
*  up to that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=176.92s)]
*  Now around that time, mid-2010s was a really interesting time in the field because we saw [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=178.0s)]
*  a lot of these new deep learning systems that were outperforming humans and some things [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=184.8s)]
*  that traditionally humans have been the only ones that have been able to do it, like image [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=188.76s)]
*  recognition, voice recognition, text recognition, other jobs as well. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=193.0s)]
*  So through 2016 and through 2019, there was this huge rush because of these more basic [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=197.92s)]
*  mathematical developments, there was this giant rush of competitors. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=203.72s)]
*  There were maybe a thousand competitors from around the world at that time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=206.6s)]
*  It seemed like any professor with a paper in the field wanted to start a company. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=210.12s)]
*  And then it was in 2019 when Ensilico launched their own platform, including a SaaS product. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=215.0s)]
*  They also work in the service spaces as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  As well as in 2019, they started their own therapeutic programs. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=224.32s)]
*  Now this was really, really important for the company because especially at that time, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  some companies were focused, most of them being AI software company, other companies [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=232.28s)]
*  really focused on building out the pipeline. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=236.96s)]
*  But Ensilico Medicine is always really focused on both. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  It turned out to be a competitive advantage because you can use the pipeline to validate [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=242.4s)]
*  your software. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=246.84s)]
*  You're not relying on anyone else to do that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=247.84s)]
*  But then from 2019 through 2023, there's been this really huge explosion in Ensilico in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=249.96s)]
*  terms of ongoing commercialization and further development of our generative AI algorithms. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=255.0s)]
*  But the niche as a whole has actually seen consolidation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=260.2s)]
*  So a lot of these companies that focus only on the pipeline or only on the platform have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=263.24s)]
*  been frankly struggling. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Some have gone away. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=269.5s)]
*  And now at the time, there's actually very few companies in the niche that have reached [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=271.12s)]
*  the level of sustained clinical development. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=274.62s)]
*  And I think we really are leaders now in this area. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=278.72s)]
*  So we now have this really robust and growing pipeline, 31 programs against 29 targets, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=281.44s)]
*  all developed internally with their own AI platform, full platforms. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=287.24s)]
*  And we consistently publish peer-reviewed papers, so a few times a month usually, which [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=291.24s)]
*  is good even for an academic lab. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=295.64s)]
*  And we've raised really a substantial amount of venture capital as well, I think over $400 [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=297.16s)]
*  million of venture capital to date, a privately held company at the moment as well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=302.44s)]
*  And we've also been awarded some really huge accolades. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=306.82s)]
*  So that's sort of our story in a nutshell. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  I joined about a year ago. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=311.64s)]
*  I was an academic for a long time in this space and I was kind of watching the story [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=312.64s)]
*  to jump into biotech to be more on the commercial side of things, learn to be at the cutting [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=318.44s)]
*  edge. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=323.44s)]
*  And so I'm really excited to be here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=324.44s)]
*  It's an area that as you've been talking about the history of the company, it's not been [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=326.36s)]
*  around for six months. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=330.74s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=333.2s)]
*  Do you think that AI has been news for the last six months and yet it's been around for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=334.2s)]
*  a lot longer than that? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=339.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good question. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=341.2s)]
*  I think there's quite a lot of reasons for it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=343.06s)]
*  The sort of recent spurts of AI, especially in the last year, there have been quite a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=346.76s)]
*  few things that have just become a bit more apparent to the public eye. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  Things like expanded use of large language models, especially for chat GPT, vision learning, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  especially in self-driving cars has really expanded, as well as VR, not just for the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  gaming industry, but it also has pretty huge applications in the military as well in drones [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=367.96s)]
*  and other similar applications. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=372.88s)]
*  So I think there have been really specific applications that have captured people's imagination [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=374.72s)]
*  and that's been really picked up by the media. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  Obviously there's a lot of money in it as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of it as well is everybody seems to be concentrating on, understandably to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  some extent, maybe jobs and the negative ways in which AI might impact people's lives in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  the future. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=397.48s)]
*  Yet there doesn't seem to be as much concentrating on the kind of thing that you're doing where [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=398.48s)]
*  you're helping people through AI. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=403.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I agree. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=405.56s)]
*  I tend to be pretty optimistic when it comes to that simply because I know myself and I [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=407.4s)]
*  know a lot of people and when people are more productive, they usually don't lay people [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=414.0s)]
*  off, they hire more so that they can make even more money in areas that aren't yet [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  like automatables. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=424.32s)]
*  We'll see how it actually pans out. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=425.32s)]
*  I mean, we have to just like keep living and being at the forefront, pushing these things [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  along. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  We also have really hard problems like drug discovery and development where there's a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=431.8s)]
*  ton of data. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=436.2s)]
*  This is not something that humans are very good at. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=437.2s)]
*  Most drugs fail. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm telling you 90% fail. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  If you look at the percentage of things that even make it in the clinical trials, it's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  even worse than that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  And so there's a ton of data and we have to be able to see patterns that humans just can't [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  see clearly. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=452.16s)]
*  They just can't see. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=453.16s)]
*  And also there's a lot of sort of repetitious aspect to certain parts of drug discovery [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=455.12s)]
*  and development, data analysis, aggregation, building systems that AI can help with as [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=461.04s)]
*  well in terms of efficiency. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=465.4s)]
*  So it makes sense. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=467.08s)]
*  AI is kind of built for this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=468.08s)]
*  It's just a matter of shaping it in the right way to actually make it effective. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=470.52s)]
*  You mentioned before some of the platforms and some of the drug discovery that you've [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=474.6s)]
*  been doing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=479.28s)]
*  Could you maybe run through some of those? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=480.28s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=482.76s)]
*  I can talk about it really at a high level. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=483.92s)]
*  So on the software side, and as a side note, 80% of what we do resource wise is actually [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=485.84s)]
*  pretty hardcore research and development in labs. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  We have a fully automated lab, fully robotic lab. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=494.4s)]
*  And so we showed that it's really cool and everyone should check out on LinkedIn and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=497.44s)]
*  YouTube. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  Our CEO loves posting videos of him dancing to different music with robots. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  So it's a lot of fun. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=506.64s)]
*  And the lab itself looks pretty futuristic. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=507.64s)]
*  But I'm talking about the software side, which is where I personally work. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=510.08s)]
*  And we have what's called the Pharma AI Suite. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  And this suite of software is comprised of three different platforms. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=516.16s)]
*  So we have biology 42, which really focuses on identifying the targets that we're going [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=520.62s)]
*  to develop drugs against and answering biological questions about things like what is the relevance [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  and impact of targeting different parts of biology and different diseases, maybe different [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  pathways or specific genes or the impact of certain drugs on that biology. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=535.48s)]
*  We also have chemistry 42. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=541.22s)]
*  It's the second component. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  And this is really focused on making small molecules that are going to be effective in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=544.28s)]
*  the clinic. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  So we're thinking about specific properties of those molecules like novelty, potency, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  metabolic stability, drugability and safety. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=556.2s)]
*  And we imagine them from scratch. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=558.4s)]
*  And then we have medicine 42, which is really focused on clinical trial design and prediction. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=560.12s)]
*  Is that all about partnerships with industry or do you do the whole process from drug discovery [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  through to the trials? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=572.42s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=574.02s)]
*  So we use this whole platform internally for all of our programs. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=575.74s)]
*  So we pick our own targets, we design our own drugs. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=579.0999999999999s)]
*  And then when it gets to the point when they're ready to go into the clinic, we usually will [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=583.06s)]
*  partner with people who are actually really, really good at clinical trial design to get [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=587.04s)]
*  them into the clinic and through the next stage. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=591.5s)]
*  And we've been pretty good at that so far. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=594.5s)]
*  We have our lead candidate is in phase two. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  Can't see the data, but things seem to be going well. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=600.66s)]
*  And we've actually out licensed quite a few of our programs now. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  So our first candidate was QPCTL, is in co-development in China with Austin Pharma. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=607.54s)]
*  We have another USP1 that's been out licensed by Exelixis. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=613.46s)]
*  And another very recent one was out licensed the Menorini group. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=617.86s)]
*  It's a cat 6 target small molecule. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=621.26s)]
*  And all these are pretty enormous deals. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=623.74s)]
*  We're talking tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=625.54s)]
*  It's really great progress. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=628.74s)]
*  Right at the very beginning, how does that work? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=630.66s)]
*  Is it a company that will come to you and say, we're looking to treat disease, whatever, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=633.42s)]
*  or is it just you looking at the potential for different small molecules and then trying [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=639.3s)]
*  to match that up with companies and diseases? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=645.16s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=648.26s)]
*  It is a little bit of both. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=649.78s)]
*  The map making, it's kind of a magical process that usually happens from both ends. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=651.1s)]
*  So we have our public pipeline that we show on our web page. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=655.98s)]
*  Anyone can go to that web page, click on the different molecules that are ready to be discussed [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=659.86s)]
*  with other groups, where we have this whole data room and really extensive lab validation [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=665.62s)]
*  of biological relevance and different properties that we want these small molecules to have. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=672.0600000000001s)]
*  And yeah, sometimes other groups that are really great in this clinical trial will come [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=676.78s)]
*  to us. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=681.1s)]
*  That certainly happens a lot, especially for the more popular targets and drugs. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=682.1s)]
*  And sometimes we go to them. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=685.54s)]
*  So we'll go out to conferences and networking events and really just look for companies [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=686.54s)]
*  where maybe their mission aligns with what we're trying to do, or maybe they're looking [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=691.06s)]
*  at a specific indication that the drug would be a really great fit for based on the data [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=694.8199999999999s)]
*  that we have. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=698.5s)]
*  And the conversations go from there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=699.5s)]
*  So we have whole BD teams kind of spread all throughout the world to do this type of work [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=701.2199999999999s)]
*  and they're doing really good work. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=704.8199999999999s)]
*  Right at that very beginning in the process, how do you come up with drugs and targets [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=707.14s)]
*  and kind of narrow it down? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=714.5s)]
*  Can you kind of talk me through that process of the beginning to coming up with something [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=716.38s)]
*  that looks promising? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=720.42s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=721.42s)]
*  So picking a drug target is probably the most important part. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=723.02s)]
*  It's also kind of the first. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=727.74s)]
*  Understanding biological relevance, understanding what's drugable in a practical sense. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=729.98s)]
*  These are all like really difficult, complicated questions. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=735.38s)]
*  Otherwise, you know, we'd be a lot better at it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=737.5799999999999s)]
*  And so early on, we have what's called the Panaomics app, which is a part of the Biology [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=740.7s)]
*  42 platform. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=744.94s)]
*  And our general approach at really high levels to incorporate huge amounts of what are called [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  multi-omics data and text data. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=751.98s)]
*  So by multi-omics data, I'm talking about data derived human patients with or without [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=754.74s)]
*  the disease. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=760.26s)]
*  And the data types would be, for example, microarray, RNA-seq, proteomics, methylomics [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=761.98s)]
*  data. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=768.9399999999999s)]
*  There's a ton of others that we can incorporate into the platform as well. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=769.9399999999999s)]
*  And really what we're looking at are at the molecular level, what are all the different [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=774.02s)]
*  changes that happen during disease states in the relevant tissues? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=777.06s)]
*  So you know, for example, leukemia, or melanoma, or opium, or skin. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=781.98s)]
*  And we feed all of these into these algorithmic models that we've already trained on huge [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=785.8199999999999s)]
*  amounts of data from many different biological disease states. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=791.5s)]
*  We've also looked at text data as well, which we think is actually really, really important, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=795.78s)]
*  kind of undervalued by people who maybe aren't as familiar with drug discovery and development. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=800.46s)]
*  So the omics data gives us really great biological insights. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=805.18s)]
*  So what is relevant or extremely dysregulated during the disease at the molecular level. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=808.46s)]
*  But the text data can also be incredibly useful as well. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=814.9s)]
*  And if you're looking for something, for example, it's really well validated by many different [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=817.66s)]
*  labs and have been published very extensively, then you might want to get something with [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=822.14s)]
*  a really strong text signal. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=827.14s)]
*  So text data as a signal of novelty or anti novelty is extremely useful. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=828.74s)]
*  Very often people will also want to look at the competitive landscape of a given target [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=834.58s)]
*  or indication when they're trying to decide if they want to invest in further. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=839.26s)]
*  And so that type of data is also very, very useful. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=842.22s)]
*  And therefore we have a bunch of different modules and tools to explore text data in [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=845.1s)]
*  the context of drug discovery within our software as well. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=849.3s)]
*  Because in developing a drug, there's sort of the biology of research, but there's also [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=852.66s)]
*  the business side of things. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=856.66s)]
*  Companies want to make sure that if they pick that target, it's going to fit into their [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=858.54s)]
*  portfolio that it fits according to their expertise, that it fits into their mission. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=862.54s)]
*  Sometimes there's a variety of other considerations as well. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=867.06s)]
*  And so we try to incorporate all those factors and make them configurable in the software. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=868.9799999999999s)]
*  And the output is this sort of heat map where every row is a different gene and every column [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=873.18s)]
*  is one of our AI or statistical models that will provide an actual value to rank and sort [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=879.34s)]
*  all of those genes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=886.66s)]
*  And in our hands at the top of that list, we see somewhere between 5X and 35X enrichment [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=888.34s)]
*  of the best targets at the top of that list. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=893.5s)]
*  And so then what they can do and what we do is we go through all the genes at the top [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=895.66s)]
*  of that list and we do a deep dive into the biology and judge with actual human experts, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=899.74s)]
*  what is the quality of the evidence underlying these scores? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=904.54s)]
*  And then is this something that we want to move forward with for validation and further [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=908.22s)]
*  development? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=912.1800000000001s)]
*  So usually at that point, there's some kind of validation in a lab model just to either [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=913.1800000000001s)]
*  validate what's already out there or if it's a really novel target to validate it for the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=917.7s)]
*  first time. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=921.1s)]
*  That could be an in vitro model, ex vivo, could be a mouse model, really whatever we [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=922.1s)]
*  sort of have at hand. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=926.6600000000001s)]
*  And then once we're really confident, hey, this is the target that we want to hit for [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=928.5400000000001s)]
*  this particular indication. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=933.02s)]
*  And actually at Encilico medicine, we try to find things that will hit multiple indications [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=934.82s)]
*  and specifically that are relevant to aging as well. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=940.22s)]
*  But then we take that target and we hand it off to their chemistry 42 team. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=943.82s)]
*  And so they then look at the actual properties of the structure and the actual structure [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=948.0600000000001s)]
*  of those. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=952.98s)]
*  We look at mostly protein targets here at Encilico and they try to design small molecules [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=954.12s)]
*  bind to that target in a very specific, selective and strong way to change the biology. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=960.3s)]
*  And there's sort of a lot going on there kind of behind the scenes, a lot of different modeling [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=967.62s)]
*  mapping, there's different really generative approaches. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=972.54s)]
*  So traditionally what people have done at this point is if you have a target, you want [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=976.14s)]
*  to design a drug against it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  What a lot of people will do is they'll take it's called a docking approach. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=981.62s)]
*  So we have these libraries either previously made molecules or perhaps molecules that could [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=985.7s)]
*  be easily synthesized and there's slight variance. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=991.5s)]
*  And then on a computer, they'll simulate those molecules binding to the correct part of the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=994.74s)]
*  protein. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=999.26s)]
*  Now this works and has worked in some cases, but when it comes to identifying real novelty, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1000.46s)]
*  if everyone's fishing in the same tiny pond, they're all going to catch the same fish. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1005.5400000000001s)]
*  And so the power of generative AI is that it can look at the problem and imagine new [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1009.78s)]
*  solutions. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1015.9s)]
*  So I know in some cases people think about chat GPT and these hallucinations being a [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1017.1s)]
*  problem, but this sort of imaginative ability of AI in this particular space can be extremely [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1021.02s)]
*  useful because it's sort of thinking of things that either haven't been imagined before or [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1025.94s)]
*  that a human wouldn't otherwise come to the conclusion of even trying that and sort of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1031.1399999999999s)]
*  ideas that makes things a bit more easily patentable. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1036.22s)]
*  So that's really important is you want something that you can actually defend from a commercial [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1040.54s)]
*  perspective. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1045.46s)]
*  You want something that is maybe even more effective than what humans would have previously [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1046.7s)]
*  come up with. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1050.7s)]
*  And so the input to the software at that point or to our chemistry 42 platform with the target [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1051.7s)]
*  and then the profile of the molecule that we want to design. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  So for example, how novel do we want it to be? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1062.38s)]
*  How potent do we want it to be? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1065.5400000000002s)]
*  How metabolically stable and how druggable? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1067.42s)]
*  It can also bias for certain safety measures as well. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1070.0200000000002s)]
*  And then it imagines molecules from scratch pretty much indefinitely. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1073.5s)]
*  So you can run these cycles of imagination as many times as you want. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1076.7s)]
*  And each cycle will generate some number of molecules based on how you configure it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1080.98s)]
*  And then you go into the lab and actually test and validate them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1084.5800000000002s)]
*  And one of the huge sort of powerful aspects here is that in our hands when we published [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1087.5s)]
*  examples of this, we don't have to screen as many molecules. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1091.74s)]
*  We don't have to screen these huge libraries and testing thousands and tens of thousands. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1095.18s)]
*  Some other groups have tested even more molecules. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1099.7s)]
*  And we have one recent example, second dependent kinase, I think we see 20, where we only had [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1103.02s)]
*  to screen like a couple dozen molecules to get a nanomolar hit. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1108.02s)]
*  It's just like extremely powerfully binding molecule, which in the long run, in terms [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1112.02s)]
*  of the full program, you have to spend less time searching for a good [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1117.02s)]
*  drug. And then the overall cost of the program is a lot less because you're getting to the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1121.5s)]
*  right answer faster or a really good answer fast. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1125.06s)]
*  And then at that point, it's really a matter of optimization. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1128.14s)]
*  So making small changes to the molecule, testing it and validating it in different lab [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1131.62s)]
*  settings. So maybe new mouse models, new in vitro models, ex vivo models, new safety [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1136.46s)]
*  models, whatever the case might be. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1141.86s)]
*  We also have other modeling software and then we can really start to see, all right, well, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1143.78s)]
*  how well is this going to perform in the clinic? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1148.02s)]
*  And that's when you pass to our clinical team and we start looking for organizations that we [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1149.5s)]
*  can outlicense with. Now, obviously, the higher level of validation for a given molecule, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1153.98s)]
*  the more likely it is a group, outlicensing group is going to feel confident enough to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1160.3s)]
*  outlicense that molecule. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1165.18s)]
*  But on the other hand, the earlier they get in, the better deal that they can get. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1166.58s)]
*  Right. So if they wait too long, then everyone's in line and that's going to drive the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1169.7s)]
*  price up. Usually, if you wait until phase one trials for safety or phase two trial for [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1174.42s)]
*  efficacy, if you wait that long, you're probably too late and not going to get the best [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1179.54s)]
*  price. But these are the balances that people try to weigh and it really just depends on the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1183.5s)]
*  organization you're working with. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1187.7s)]
*  We hear a lot about targets being undruggable. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1189.3s)]
*  Is AI helping to alleviate that? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1192.94s)]
*  But kind of associated with that, are there targets that are still going to be undruggable [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1196.3400000000001s)]
*  regardless? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1201.3400000000001s)]
*  That's a great question. To some extent, this is a little bit philosophical, but I'm going to [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1202.74s)]
*  give my opinion here. Undruggable and that the reason for that is undruggable simply means [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1208.46s)]
*  we can't drug it at the moment or seemingly can't drug it at the moment. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1212.7s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that someone has tried or that it can't potentially be [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1217.18s)]
*  drugged if someone did try. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1222.58s)]
*  But historically, there's specific types of molecules that have been drugged more often [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1224.3s)]
*  or that have been drugged at all. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1230.66s)]
*  And so there are different ways to define drug ability. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1232.22s)]
*  I think that sort of loose way is the one that I would propose. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1235.42s)]
*  There's a lot of different things that can make a target quote unquote undruggable. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1238.98s)]
*  And AI can really help with quite a few of them actually. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1242.58s)]
*  So first would be sort of structural unavailability. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1246.74s)]
*  So when a protein is acting in a signaling pathway that is related to the development of a [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1250.42s)]
*  disease, there's usually certain parts of the protein that are involved in that process more [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1256.42s)]
*  than other parts. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1262.82s)]
*  So if it's an enzyme, there's certain maybe a little pocket that is involved in changing other [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1263.82s)]
*  molecules and enabling signaling, for example. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1269.5s)]
*  So it might be actually the case that the drug target may be structurally unsuitable for drug [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1272.62s)]
*  binding within that pocket where you want the small molecule to bind for chemical reasons. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1278.86s)]
*  Now, this is really where I think AI has been extremely powerful because of that imaginative [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1283.9399999999998s)]
*  ability where previously, you know, the chemists would sit down, they'd look at some [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1289.22s)]
*  structures that people tried before, they look at the structure itself, they try to imagine [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1293.22s)]
*  some things and they go through and they iterate, they synthesize and test and design, synthesize [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1296.9s)]
*  and test, you know, with AI that you can usually get to an answer much faster. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1301.54s)]
*  Some targets are also a bit more complex in how they're involved in various biological [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1306.18s)]
*  processes where, you know, targeting something, it might effectively treat the disease, but it [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1312.82s)]
*  might also, targeting that particular target with a drug may also cause toxicity just by the nature [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1319.3799999999999s)]
*  of the fact that that one protein is involved in some really important biological process. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1325.54s)]
*  And so if you disrupt that biological process, it causes toxicity, but it's also involved in [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1331.3799999999999s)]
*  the disease. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1336.5s)]
*  So proteins can do different things in different contexts. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1337.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, so the problem of safety is something that hasn't quite been cracked yet, but there's [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1340.5s)]
*  quite a few groups working on that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1344.5s)]
*  We have a paper in submission on some new AI-based models where we can sort of predict how [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1346.74s)]
*  much a target is involved in these types of pathways that might cause toxicity if you target [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1351.46s)]
*  them. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1357.86s)]
*  So that's certainly a question that we can get to, but there's a ton of work that needs to be done [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1358.18s)]
*  there. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1362.1s)]
*  Another issue is selectivity. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1362.8999999999999s)]
*  The drug target may not be unique to the disease-causing cells if it is a certain cell that's [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1366.02s)]
*  causing the disease. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1372.02s)]
*  So disrupting that target may also affect other healthy cells. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1372.9s)]
*  Even within a certain cell, there may also be other targets that look very similar to the one [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1376.58s)]
*  that you're trying to target. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1383.62s)]
*  And so coming up with this idea of finding something that's really going to only target what [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1385.06s)]
*  you want to target is really difficult. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1388.9s)]
*  There's also physical considerations, like where inside the cell is the target. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1391.1399999999999s)]
*  Believe it or not, like targeting different parts of the inside of a cell can be more or less [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1396.66s)]
*  difficult. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1401.38s)]
*  Imagine different barriers and walls as you move from the outside of the cell into the nucleus. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1402.3400000000001s)]
*  You might have to go through a few different membranes and maybe some different ion channels [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1408.8200000000002s)]
*  in order to get to where you want to go to actually have the effect that you want to have. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1414.0200000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of other factors to consider, like functional redundancy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1418.5800000000002s)]
*  Sometimes targeting one thing, you know, nature has a way possibly of compensating with another [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1422.66s)]
*  way of coming in and causing disease along the same pathway, just not using the target [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1427.94s)]
*  that you're trying to block with your drug. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1433.6200000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, there's also drug resistance, where like, for example, in cancer, cancer is a [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1437.46s)]
*  genetic disease and in many different cancers, there's a lot of different sort of heterogeneity [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1442.98s)]
*  that happens there. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1448.18s)]
*  And so by maybe treating certain groups of cancer cells, there's others that can grow and that are [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1449.38s)]
*  only selecting for a subset of those. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1455.22s)]
*  And in general, heterogeneity of diseases is a problem. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1456.98s)]
*  So just, you know, disease is often classified by how it looks at the patient level and maybe at [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1460.34s)]
*  the molecular level, there are some really major differences between patients that sort of present [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1466.5s)]
*  the same types of problems. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1470.98s)]
*  But if you treat a group of patients with a drug, maybe only some of those patients will actually [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1473.22s)]
*  respond to that drug because of what's actually causing it at the molecular level. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1478.42s)]
*  That, you know, isn't really very clear at the clinical level. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1482.5s)]
*  So those are a few examples. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1485.54s)]
*  No, because I was going to say that just because you can find something that will bind to a target [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1488.02s)]
*  doesn't mean, okay, we're done. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1493.3799999999999s)]
*  There's so much more involved. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1495.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1497.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1498.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1498.98s)]
*  But biology is extremely complicated. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1499.22s)]
*  The chemistry is complicated. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1500.82s)]
*  You know, there's sort of this epidemiology aspect to it as well. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1502.5s)]
*  That can be really tough to overcome. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1505.86s)]
*  And that's not even mentioning a commercial aspect. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1508.98s)]
*  Or once you have something, even if it's effective, it works in all patients. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1511.62s)]
*  It's super safe. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1514.58s)]
*  You know, is it actually going to make money, which is how you actually get it into the patients? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1515.6999999999998s)]
*  And I know that we hear a lot about machine learning, artificial intelligence, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1520.1799999999998s)]
*  and also quantum computing. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1524.8999999999999s)]
*  Is quantum computing involved in this? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1527.1399999999999s)]
*  And how does that fit in? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1529.3799999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1531.86s)]
*  I think the era of quantum computing, in my personal opinion, hasn't quite reached us yet. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1532.82s)]
*  But a lot of people are sort of looking at really what could be the next [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1539.3s)]
*  type of math that could really revolutionize this space. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1544.34s)]
*  I think some people would even argue that drug discovery and development, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1547.54s)]
*  AI hasn't really fully had its day yet. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1551.1399999999999s)]
*  If you look at this sort of our niche, the Silicon Medicine's niche, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1553.7s)]
*  most of the AI-driven companies are really, really young. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1558.74s)]
*  And I'm talking about like early 2010s, the mid 2010s, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1562.82s)]
*  most of them were kind of founded around that time. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1569.3000000000002s)]
*  So if you think about the amount of time it takes to develop a drug [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1571.38s)]
*  and then to get it through, more importantly, clinical trials, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1575.22s)]
*  we haven't really gotten there yet. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1578.5800000000002s)]
*  I think most experts would say that there hasn't really been a drug that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1580.26s)]
*  is fully informed from end to end with AI [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1585.3000000000002s)]
*  that has made it fully through clinical trials and is actually given to patients at this point. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1588.18s)]
*  I think in Silicon Medicine's in the lead with our lead candidate, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1593.14s)]
*  but we'll see the race is still on. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1596.02s)]
*  I think every time our CEO posts anything on LinkedIn, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1599.62s)]
*  he's actually shown me his analytics before, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  tens of thousands of big pharma, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1606.1s)]
*  really important people out there are watching to see what kind of updates he has. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1608.5s)]
*  Is it going to work? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1613.1399999999999s)]
*  Is it not going to work? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1613.78s)]
*  What are going to be the phase two readouts? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1614.66s)]
*  Is it effective? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1617.06s)]
*  Is it safe? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1617.86s)]
*  And there's other AI-driven companies that have their own molecules in the clinic as well at this time. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1618.82s)]
*  I think we're all just really waiting to see if that's effective. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1625.3s)]
*  And these early cases could change the minds of investors, of scientists, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1627.46s)]
*  as far as what is the final verdict? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1632.74s)]
*  Is AI really ready to have the impact that we sort of imagined it would have just a few years ago? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1635.1399999999999s)]
*  In terms of quantum computing, I think this is certainly an area where we are [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1640.74s)]
*  investigating as well. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1645.06s)]
*  We're an AI-driven company because of our expertise, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1646.4199999999998s)]
*  but we certainly have quite a lot of diverse expertise in-house. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1648.34s)]
*  We're trying to think how we take different approaches to answering some of these really [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1651.78s)]
*  basic problems in especially drug design. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1656.66s)]
*  Imagining new molecules, simulating, finding of drugs to targets, designing new drugs. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1660.34s)]
*  There's really a lot of really hard problems. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1666.74s)]
*  And just because we started in one place, we have a certain type of expertise. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1669.78s)]
*  We don't want to be the guy with the hammer looking for a nail. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1673.78s)]
*  And so we're really just trying to explore all the different options. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1676.8999999999999s)]
*  I would say that's about as far as I can go with it for now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1679.78s)]
*  But yeah, I'm excited to see what actually happens. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1683.06s)]
*  If AI will rule the day, if quantum computing will take over next or not. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1685.62s)]
*  I think it's yet to be seen. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1690.02s)]
*  Is AI evolving incredibly quickly in terms of what you're doing with drug discovery? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1691.54s)]
*  And what kind of scales of improvement is that making in terms of cost and time? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1698.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1706.18s)]
*  In terms of pre-clinical drug discovery, AI has developed extremely fast and made [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1708.4199999999998s)]
*  huge, huge, huge strides. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1715.2199999999998s)]
*  This is all work before the clinic in terms of picking a target, designing, especially [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1717.06s)]
*  small molecules, proteins that are like large molecules, other modalities. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1721.62s)]
*  I think that is still in flux where there's a lot of groups. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1725.78s)]
*  And we're also in this space too, doing really great work. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1729.06s)]
*  But in terms of small molecules, traditionally this time period would be [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1732.6599999999999s)]
*  five, six, seven years. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1736.98s)]
*  And that's not even counting possibly decades of work on the target in academia, where people [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1739.38s)]
*  have been looking to the biology of different diseases for a very long time and just maybe [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1745.8600000000001s)]
*  haven't tried to commercialize it. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1749.7s)]
*  But if you're starting from scratch, you want to get ready to have a molecule that's ready [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1751.38s)]
*  to be tested in the clinic. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1756.1s)]
*  Some estimates have been around the five, six year mark fall apart. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1757.7s)]
*  Whereas with our lead candidate program, we've been able to go from nothing to something [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1761.46s)]
*  ready to go into the clinic in only 30 months. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1765.46s)]
*  So that's a pretty huge time savings. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1767.6200000000001s)]
*  And if you look at the cost savings as well, we're talking about like a whole factor of [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1770.18s)]
*  maybe 10 in terms of cost savings. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1775.06s)]
*  But really most importantly, it's more about getting effective safe drugs to patients faster. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1779.22s)]
*  So at the end of the day, the ultimate shareholders, right? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1784.1000000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of barriers in the clinic. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1788.66s)]
*  And after that, that AI hasn't really made as huge strides on. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1790.74s)]
*  But in terms of preclinical work, it's been absolutely huge. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1794.8200000000002s)]
*  There's papers being published really on a weekly basis in this space. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1798.26s)]
*  As I mentioned, also, most of the participants are still new companies in the grand scheme [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1802.9s)]
*  of things. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1808.1000000000001s)]
*  And so the whole space is really, I would say, still young, up for grabs sort of in the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1808.5800000000002s)]
*  early development cycles. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1813.8600000000001s)]
*  I would argue none of them are really mature yet. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1816.02s)]
*  And then depending on your modality, like what type of therapy you're developing, it [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1818.74s)]
*  could be entirely new. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1822.42s)]
*  You might be cutting new grass like every day. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1823.86s)]
*  Looking at your website, there's an awful lot coming out of your company. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1828.1s)]
*  And one of the most recent things, I guess, is a partnership with the University of Toronto. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1832.66s)]
*  And if you could tell me a little bit about that? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1836.74s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1839.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1840.26s)]
*  So we absolutely love working with academics. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1840.74s)]
*  As an alliance manager, one of the things that I do is sort of manage our collaborations [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1843.94s)]
*  with different academics around the world. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1848.34s)]
*  We apply for grants with them. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1850.58s)]
*  We love to co-apply for grants with academics. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1851.9399999999998s)]
*  We do pretty often. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1854.74s)]
*  And then work on the project with them when we get the grant. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1855.9399999999998s)]
*  I think they like to work with us because we have the brand, we have the expertise in [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1858.8999999999999s)]
*  the space, and we've delivered on so many projects successfully and on time. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1863.06s)]
*  So we also like to be connected to what is cutting edge in the field and also validating [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1867.54s)]
*  with publications what our models, our algorithms can actually do in real world scenarios, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1873.06s)]
*  and at least research-based scenarios. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1880.5s)]
*  So the University of Toronto, they do a lot of good work. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1882.4199999999998s)]
*  There's a particular researcher, Ivar Stagdar. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1886.5s)]
*  So he's a molecular geneticist and professor there. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1889.54s)]
*  We're sort of partnering with him to test the ability of our platform to design molecules [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1892.98s)]
*  against these quote unquote, undruggable targets. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1899.22s)]
*  So basically just targets that have been out of the reach of these more conventional [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1902.02s)]
*  therapeutics. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1906.02s)]
*  This lab has developed really fascinating assays to test somewhere around like 15 to 20 [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1907.06s)]
*  of these undruggable targets as a part of the collaboration. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1913.22s)]
*  We'll use the platform to identify them and to design the molecules as well, focusing [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1916.74s)]
*  really in on cancer and specific types of cancer genes, and then focusing on those cancer [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1922.42s)]
*  gene products, the proteins that have specific types of protein-protein interactions. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1929.46s)]
*  So the idea here is that we pick the targets with our platform, we design molecules with [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1933.6200000000001s)]
*  our platform, and then we validate them using this technology that this lab has developed [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1938.0200000000002s)]
*  for confirming disruption of certain types of protein interactions inside of a cell, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1942.8200000000002s)]
*  as opposed to more artificial systems. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1949.22s)]
*  It makes a lot of sense. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1951.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like a perfect, I think, marriage and a good example of how we can work with [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1952.8200000000002s)]
*  academic labs to really develop hypotheses and validate them very quickly for publications, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1957.62s)]
*  for grants, and really ultimately for real world impact of something that could hopefully [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1963.3s)]
*  treat patients. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1969.1399999999999s)]
*  Obviously everyone's different, but what kind of timescales do you look at from being [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1970.8999999999999s)]
*  able to turn this into, I guess, a phase three trial that eventually works with patients? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1976.02s)]
*  Great question. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1982.8999999999999s)]
*  I mentioned sort of the preclinical timescale. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1983.62s)]
*  It's really more on one to two-year timescale at this point. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1986.34s)]
*  I think there's even room for it to get much less than that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1989.3s)]
*  Our lead candidate, like I said, was 30 months. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1993.06s)]
*  Once it gets into the labs, there's a whole new set of barriers there that, you know, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=1995.3s)]
*  in silico medicine hasn't really started to tackle at this time. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2000.1799999999998s)]
*  As an academic lab, I think a lot of our expertise has been early in the drug discovery [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2004.58s)]
*  process where we believe the biggest impact in terms of chance of success can come through, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2008.1799999999998s)]
*  because when you look at why do clinical trials fail, focusing especially on small molecules, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2014.26s)]
*  there's really two overwhelming reasons. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2019.86s)]
*  They're not effective and they're not safe. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2023.06s)]
*  We think that in both of those cases, a lot of these drugs are not effective and or not [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2026.98s)]
*  safe because they're picking the wrong target. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2032.9s)]
*  They could be picking the wrong target. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2035.78s)]
*  I mean, they could also design a molecule that is either ineffective or unsafe for other [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2036.98s)]
*  reasons as well. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2041.7s)]
*  So we really wanted to focus on where we could make the biggest impact and where our expertise [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2042.82s)]
*  was as well. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2047.6200000000001s)]
*  Once it gets into the clinic, honestly, those timelines have not really changed much from [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2048.5s)]
*  sort of the traditional approaches. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2053.06s)]
*  And so we tend to partner with other organizations that have shown the ability to quickly push [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2055.22s)]
*  good molecules through the clinic rigorously in clinical trials. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2062.82s)]
*  A lot of the inefficiency there has to do with identifying patients, sort of organizing the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2066.66s)]
*  trial, getting buy-in from the different organizations that will actually run the trial, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2072.1s)]
*  things like training all the staff and doctors that are going to be involved in recording [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2076.9s)]
*  the data and sort of keeping track of the progress of the trials and different randomized and [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2081.7799999999997s)]
*  other types of legal and scientific reporting that's required. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2086.9s)]
*  It's a pretty massive undertaking. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2090.66s)]
*  And I think the more you involve people in the process, the more things get mocked down, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2093.38s)]
*  especially when you have people who, doctors that are really busy, other medical professionals [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2097.7s)]
*  that have a lot on their plate, patients that are sick, a lot of really hard problems that I think [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2104.98s)]
*  are more human problems are going to take a little bit longer to address. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2110.1s)]
*  But getting drugs through phase three, it'll depend on the indication. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2113.7799999999997s)]
*  So some types of diseases are very acute. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2117.86s)]
*  They happen quickly and you'll be able to tell very quickly does the drug work or not, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2121.62s)]
*  whether that is a deadly disease or not, it can be acute. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2125.46s)]
*  It can also be very chronic where some of these diseases take decades. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2127.94s)]
*  Maybe it's a very slow growing tumor or it's a long-term infection or autoimmune disease [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2133.14s)]
*  where the treatment itself may take a couple of years to properly measure [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2140.58s)]
*  is this drug being effective or not and we expect it to take that long. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2146.26s)]
*  And so a lot of the details do matter of the trial, where it's being held, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2150.66s)]
*  who's actually running the trial, what type of disease is it, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2154.5s)]
*  what are you actually targeting to really give you an idea how long that's going to take. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2157.7s)]
*  We're still talking several years here. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2161.06s)]
*  We're talking four to 10 years. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2162.66s)]
*  So it's really, really hard to say, but we specialize in finding partners that do it quickly [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2164.58s)]
*  because that's sort of our moniker. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2170.1s)]
*  And I think down the road, that's really the area where AI could have the biggest impact [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2172.26s)]
*  in delivering drugs faster to patients because as of right now, like the last few years, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2177.14s)]
*  the number of approved drugs isn't increasing because it can only test drugs so fast. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2181.54s)]
*  There's actually a whole law about this, the e-womb law. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2188.1s)]
*  It's like the opposite of Moore's law. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2191.46s)]
*  For over time, approving drugs becomes slower and more expensive over time. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2193.06s)]
*  You mentioned the work with the University of Toronto is with cancer. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2199.22s)]
*  Are there other indications that you're working on? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2202.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, there's quite a few. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2206.18s)]
*  We have a number of collaborations with different academic partners, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2207.94s)]
*  really all around the world at this point. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2211.78s)]
*  And we have a number of grants that are in submission at the moment, actually. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2214.58s)]
*  I'm not going to mention ones that are sort of in progress, just confidentiality reasons, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2219.3s)]
*  but if you look at our publication record, you can see we've made pretty huge contributions [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2222.58s)]
*  and done really cool work in ALS, in NASH, and really a variety of other diseases. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2226.98s)]
*  All of our publications are on the website, it's alupa.com, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2232.34s)]
*  for those publications, and all really sortable by the category. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2235.3s)]
*  And you can kind of look at those. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2239.1400000000003s)]
*  That's one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the ability to sort of interact with [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2241.0600000000004s)]
*  these researchers, see the latest cutting-edge work, and see how our technology can immediately [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2246.26s)]
*  impact their research programs and outcomes for eventually the patients. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2250.02s)]
*  So it's really, really, really fun working with these people. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2253.7000000000003s)]
*  I was an academic myself for about a decade, and I've recovered, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2256.5s)]
*  but still a lot of fun to just get to work with them now from a different perspective. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2259.86s)]
*  I appreciate at the beginning of the podcast I mentioned the name of Canada's biggest city [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2265.3s)]
*  without saying how it is pronounced there, and most people do call it Toronto. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2272.1800000000003s)]
*  But if you're from there, you're a Torontonian. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2276.26s)]
*  Anyway, it's not the only place in the world that isn't pronounced the way it looks. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2279.38s)]
*  Probably an entire podcast episode on that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2284.26s)]
*  Anyway, AI is here to stay, and its impact in biotech is only going to grow. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2287.38s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2292.74s)]
*  and I hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2298.18s)]
*  Thanks for listening, and I hope you'll join us next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi3Im1nYoI&t=2301.7799999999997s)]
