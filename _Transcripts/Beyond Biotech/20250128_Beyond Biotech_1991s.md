# Is Tome writing the final chapter in genomic medicine?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 85. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. There are often big claims made in every walk of life [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  and this week we have an interview with a company in the US that says it is writing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=24.12s)]
*  the final chapter in genomic medicines. That company is Tome Biosciences and it definitely [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=28.94s)]
*  has a case as you will hear in this conversation with the company's president and CEO Raoul Kakar. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=37.1s)]
*  So I guess the first question then is if you could tell me a bit about Tome from the initial ideas to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=44.1s)]
*  the recent exiting of stealth mode. Yeah happy to do so. Tome was founded in 2021, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  really initially off foundational science from a lab run by Jonathan Gutenberg and Omar Ahmediah [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=57.5s)]
*  at MIT and they devised a way of using a conglomerate of enzymes to put very large pieces of DNA into the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=63.86s)]
*  genome in a site-specific manner what they call programmability. And I remember in the summer of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=74.3s)]
*  2021 after my prior company had been acquired reading the paper sometime before it was published, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=80.06s)]
*  pre-print and being even not having a history or experience in the field of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=87.02s)]
*  and genome editing being struck by the profound quantum leap that this science represented. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=96.26s)]
*  Because to date when we think about the field of genetic or genomic medicines, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=104.9s)]
*  so medicines that are derived from manipulating DNA specifically, we've been very limited in terms [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  of how we can manipulate DNA. We can randomly place pieces of DNA into the genome. We can place [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=118.3s)]
*  pieces of DNA with very little control through what's called blunt-end insertion. We can cut [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=126.62s)]
*  DNA and break it through CRISPR-Cas9 and in some cases we can put pieces of DNA in places that are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=131.78s)]
*  natively recognized by the enzyme, what we call safe harbors. But to really have true user control, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=140.66s)]
*  to empower a drug developer with the capability of editing the DNA as if it were computer code [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=148.66s)]
*  with true flexibility has eluded us as an industry within the discipline of nucleic acid sciences. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=157.46s)]
*  It really has been a holy grail that has eluded scientists until our founders devised this method [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=165.82s)]
*  of again using not one enzyme but multiple enzymes in a specific configuration to be able to again [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=172.22s)]
*  programmably or site specifically put very very large pieces of DNA into the genome. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=179.82s)]
*  And once you can do that, not only was there sort of obvious applications as a combination of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  obvious applications as a company, but at least in my estimation as I read the paper, it ushers in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=193.86s)]
*  what I would consider the final maturation of genomic sciences for therapeutic purposes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  I would say that of the technology that have come previously, and although I do believe there will [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=207.86s)]
*  be a few very important medicines that will do great good for patients that come out of the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=214.5s)]
*  companies that have come before us, many of those technologies, I think history, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=219.78s)]
*  as best as I can surmise, I think history will judge those as to be important advances along the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=224.82s)]
*  way towards this idea of programmably and flexibly editing the DNA. And so everything we've done here [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=229.86s)]
*  from that initial technology and industrializing it and scaling it to be a drug development platform [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=237.46s)]
*  to most recently the acquisition of replace therapeutics, which we can talk about in the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=244.02s)]
*  course of this conversation, really has been about Tome as a company wedded to this idea [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=247.86s)]
*  of DNA is the code of life and to really bring genomic medicines to their maturity, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  we need to build a stable of tools, not just one tool, but a stable of tools that allows us to edit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=263.22s)]
*  the DNA in that light. You mentioned it being a quantum leap earlier. Does that mean that things [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=268.98s)]
*  like CRISPR Cas9 are going to be redundant or do they still have a role? They very much still have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=275.86s)]
*  a role. So all of the technologies that we have, and there are two that we are actively developing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=281.94s)]
*  in a third that we're evaluating, they all use CRISPR Cas9 at their core. I think one way to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=288.1s)]
*  think about it is CRISPR Cas9 as the CPU of a computer. And in order to make a computer, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=293.7s)]
*  a desktop with certain capabilities versus a tablet versus a laptop versus a watch versus an [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=302.42s)]
*  iPhone, you augment the core brain with other functionality. And that is what our technologies [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=308.18s)]
*  look like. CRISPR Cas9, we can certainly do with other castes, but we really haven't found one that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=316.02s)]
*  is superior to Cas9 at this time as the core element of our technologies. And then we augment [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=321.38s)]
*  its capabilities with other enzymes, which greatly expand and transform its capabilities. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=329.62s)]
*  Because of that quantum leap, you've raised a lot of money for the company where other companies [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=337.06s)]
*  have struggled for funding, or at least some have. Is that the reason behind the success? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=342.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think when you are developing a novel drug development platform, in the truest sense [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=348.18s)]
*  of the word, and a new way of devising medicines that come from being able to manipulate DNA, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=355.54s)]
*  if you take a step back, what you're really doing is creating a company whose pipeline [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  is going to spread from the final evolution of what we traditionally have thought of as gene [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=365.94s)]
*  therapies, all the way through to cellular therapies. Because when you can really recode [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=373.62s)]
*  DNA to do whatever you want it to do, you bring a whole new level of design power to cell therapies. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=379.62s)]
*  And a company that spreads from rare disease, integrative gene therapies, as we call them, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=389.06s)]
*  through common disease cell therapies, with a novel DNA editing technology, is going to have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=397.06s)]
*  several complexities. It's going to be a relatively large organization, a lot of different [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=404.5s)]
*  skill sets, a lot of expertise, even before you even get to the clinic. It's going to require [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=408.66s)]
*  some breakthroughs in process development, manufacturing, etc. And so that becomes an [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  expensive company to run. And so we have been able to raise a larger quantum of capital within the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  spectrum of, to what you alluded to, the amount of capital that companies have been able to raise in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  the last couple of years, particularly in a very difficult time for our industry. But I think, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=432.5s)]
*  one, that is what the technology requires. And fortunately, there are investment firms [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=437.3s)]
*  and individuals who have the financial horsepower and the vision to see the potential of the company [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=444.98s)]
*  and the technology and to back the company with the amount of capital that's required [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=452.42s)]
*  to move what is effectively a new regime of drug development forward. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=457.06s)]
*  In terms of the process and how you actually work, you can insert DNA sequences into the genome or [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=461.86s)]
*  PGI, programmable genomic integration. What's the benefit of doing that? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=469.22s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So in the past, scientists and drug development experts have been limited [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=475.38s)]
*  in how they design and develop therapies based on DNA by the DNA editing and manipulating tools [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=483.46s)]
*  that they had. When you can now insert DNA, whether it's 10 base pairs, 100 base pairs, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=496.34s)]
*  1000 base pairs, or 10,000 base pairs plus, which our various technologies allow us to do [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  anything from 10 to 10s of thousands of base pairs in a manner that is flexible in terms of size, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=513.54s)]
*  flexible in terms of efficiency, which is how many alleles are you editing when you target a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=521.86s)]
*  given organ, and flexible in terms of location, where it's not location that is restricted by the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=527.78s)]
*  tools, but restricted only by the imagination of the drug developer, you can do several things. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=536.1s)]
*  When there is a genetic disease, in other words, a child or an adult suffering from a disease where [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=542.58s)]
*  nature has broken a gene, inadvertently, we can fix the gene in situ, which means we can repair [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  the DNA in a manner that the cell will function as if it never had a broken gene to begin with. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  It's not patching. It's not a workaround for genetic defect, as could be argued is the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=561.14s)]
*  reality for current methods of gene therapy. Again, to use computer parlance, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=568.5s)]
*  it's not running a subroutine, or it's not having to move from Microsoft Word to Google Docs because [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=573.62s)]
*  Microsoft Word is broken. It's repairing the primary problem. That allows the cell to grow [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=578.74s)]
*  and develop and to regulate its own processes in a completely natural way. Over 90% of the human [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=585.62s)]
*  genome is regulatory. It doesn't code for the proteins that do the business. Regulation of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=591.7s)]
*  genes is incredibly important, more so in some cells than others, but in general regulation of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=597.62s)]
*  genes is incredibly important. Our ability to manipulate DNA in situ or in its place allows [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=601.62s)]
*  those natural regulatory elements to do what nature designed them to do. On the other side of the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=609.14s)]
*  business on the cell therapy side, cell therapies have provided incredible, absolutely revolutionary [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=613.86s)]
*  efficacy for patients with rare liquid tumors or hematologic malignancies, but they've had a very [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=621.14s)]
*  difficult time moving beyond that niche. We believe that the reason for that is we haven't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=626.26s)]
*  been able to actually completely hijack the source code of a cell to have it do what we wanted to do [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=633.86s)]
*  from a therapeutic standpoint rather than what limited abilities we can give it when you can [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=640.98s)]
*  only do limited things with the DNA. And so this ability to really be size agnostic, high efficiency [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  and completely site specific really allows us to repair genes in their place for genetic defects [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=652.4200000000001s)]
*  and to start to think about bringing cell therapies out of the corners of medicine more into the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=660.98s)]
*  mainstream. Those are not capabilities that are possible with technologies coming before Tome, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=666.98s)]
*  which are much more limited before PGI. When it comes to those genetic conditions or diseases, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=672.74s)]
*  how do you first find the issue in the genetic code and then go about changing it? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=680.02s)]
*  So when you talk about Tome really having three verticals, one vertical is platform engineering [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=686.74s)]
*  where we do a lot of the fundamental, like I said, industrialization, engineering of the base [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=693.06s)]
*  technologies. And then we have two product development arms. One is for what we call [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=699.14s)]
*  integrative gene therapies, which is sort of where your question kind of aligns. And then we have [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=703.6999999999999s)]
*  cell therapies. For integrative gene therapies, we target diseases that are well recognized by [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=708.5799999999999s)]
*  medicine today. Many of them are either identified early in childhood when a child is born and has a [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=714.5799999999999s)]
*  certain constellation of signs and symptoms. Some of them are picked up even earlier than initial [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=721.7s)]
*  signs and symptoms through newborn screening because they are prevalent enough. But these [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=726.74s)]
*  are generally diseases that are well known within medicine and understanding whether a child or an [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  adult has that disease is a matter of sequencing the genome, which is used in academic centers and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=738.1s)]
*  hospitals today. So we are taking those diseases, which are recognized by medical institutions today [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=743.7s)]
*  in childhood and an adult using standard diagnostic techniques that are also used today, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=750.82s)]
*  but bringing potentially truly curative solutions to those children and adults who are given a [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=756.34s)]
*  diagnosis and in many cases have to either live with the disease or wrestle with suboptimal [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=763.7800000000001s)]
*  chronic therapies, which only partially control their disease. You explained a bit about integrase [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=770.74s)]
*  mediated PGI and ligase mediated PGI and the differences between them. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=776.58s)]
*  By all means. So this is what we were talking about before as augmenting the core of CRISPR-Cas9 [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=781.86s)]
*  with other enzymes, other proteins, which do the business. And one of those kind of workhorse [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=787.94s)]
*  enzymes that we marry to CRISPR-Cas9 is an integrase. Integrases are naturally occurring [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=796.58s)]
*  enzymes which integrate very large pieces of DNA into the genome. This is their function in nature. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=802.9s)]
*  What our founders have done and what we've improved upon is combining the seek and find capability of [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=810.02s)]
*  CRISPR-Cas9 with the integrating capability of the integrase to bring that functionality [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=817.9399999999999s)]
*  of putting very large pieces of DNA, thousands to tens of thousands of base pairs into the genome [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=824.26s)]
*  in the site that is specified by the programming of CRISPR-Cas9. When it comes to ligase mediated [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=830.42s)]
*  programmable genomic integration or LPGI, ligase mediated PGI, rather than using an integrase, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=838.02s)]
*  we use a ligase. And the reason we use one versus the other is that integrases are very, very good [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=843.3s)]
*  at handling very large pieces of DNA. Again, thousands to tens of thousands. But they are, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=850.3399999999999s)]
*  for their complexity, they are a bit of overkill when you want to integrate tens to hundreds of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=857.22s)]
*  base pairs. And so a much simpler system would be to use a ligase, another naturally occurring enzyme [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=863.78s)]
*  which ligates into the genome smaller segments of DNA. And so that was the technology we acquired [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=871.14s)]
*  from Replace Therapeutics. We saw it as very complementary to our first technology, integrase [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=877.46s)]
*  mediated PGI, but much more of a simpler system, fewer components, easier to deliver, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=882.66s)]
*  and much better suited to those smaller edits. So we think about ligase mediated PGI for those [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=888.8199999999999s)]
*  instances where we want to edit portions of a gene or portions of the regulatory elements of a gene, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=894.26s)]
*  but integrase mediated PGI really when we want to replace a gene wholesale. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=900.3399999999999s)]
*  Are there any dangers or challenges involved with these kind of techniques? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=904.5799999999999s)]
*  Always, always, always. When you're addressing, you know, manipulating the code of life, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=910.34s)]
*  there are always going to be dangers. And I would say the biggest danger is what we call off target [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=914.66s)]
*  where your edit or your insert is not where you want it to be. We are lucky to have a scientific [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=919.22s)]
*  team who have been thinking about designing methods and presenting those methods to regulators, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=927.22s)]
*  methods which deal with the risk of off targets. And so our genomics team who handles that, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=936.26s)]
*  professionals who have a history of thinking about and addressing issues of off targets, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=942.26s)]
*  work very closely with our platform development team. That's the team, as I mentioned before, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=948.66s)]
*  who does the engineering of the enzymes to increase their efficiency and increase their [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=953.3s)]
*  specificity. And so combining our platform development team with our genomics team, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=958.42s)]
*  we have spent the last couple of years not just industrializing the platform and determining which [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=964.1s)]
*  diseases we think are most amenable to PGI, but also designing the methods and assays, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=970.58s)]
*  some of which are completely bespoke, given the newness of the technology, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=978.1800000000001s)]
*  to reduce the risk of and to evaluate off target effects. So we have a very strong focus on the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=981.94s)]
*  safety of what we're doing at Tome. We put a lot of resources and dedicated teams to making sure [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=988.58s)]
*  what we do to the genome is precise and minimizes the risk of untoward edits that we wouldn't want [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=994.02s)]
*  within the genome. Is this something that is reversible? I mean, if there was a mistake, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1000.18s)]
*  could you go in and fix it? We have done some work to show that it can be reversible if programmed, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1006.9s)]
*  if designed the right way. Our first programs will likely not include those elements. It adds [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1013.62s)]
*  a layer of technical complexity, but we certainly see in the future that we may be able to layer on [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1019.06s)]
*  a level of engineering which allows reversibility. To put it quite frankly, integrases can integrate, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1026.74s)]
*  but they can also excise. And so adding another layer of programming where the first layer [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1033.54s)]
*  inserts the DNA, the corrective DNA, where the reprogramming DNA that we like, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1039.1399999999999s)]
*  eventually we could layer on another layer of engineering which allows us to then excise that [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1045.3s)]
*  if there's an issue. What conditions and diseases will you be applying this to initially? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1048.82s)]
*  We haven't publicly disclosed our pipeline, which we will be doing later this year. But what I can [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1054.5s)]
*  say is, because it is a very new technology, and any new technology in its first instance, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1060.34s)]
*  and this is more a tenant of startup company building, we want to make sure that we minimize [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1068.02s)]
*  the risks that we take, not just to the patient, but also to the company itself. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1075.06s)]
*  And so we've decided initially to focus the two programmatic pillars in areas where we felt there [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1080.74s)]
*  was manageable risk and a high degree of probability of success to help the patients that we'd like to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1087.7s)]
*  address first. And so on the integrative gene therapy side, we'll be focusing on diseases of [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1095.1399999999999s)]
*  the liver, primarily because delivery of these components is most well understood when it comes [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1101.3s)]
*  to the liver. Delivery to other organs like muscle, brain tissue, kidney, they are more [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1108.8999999999999s)]
*  experimental in the industry right now, but the liver is more routine. And fortunately, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1116.02s)]
*  we were able to scour the landscape of genetic defects of the liver and determine four or five [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1121.46s)]
*  diseases which are not similar to where most CRISPR Cas9 companies are going. And we felt we're [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1129.22s)]
*  truly conditions of unmet need where we could really do a service to those patients. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1137.7s)]
*  And I think great technology is fine, but it is really only truly great if it can create [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1142.98s)]
*  great medicines, a great technology that just creates a medicine that doesn't add value to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1150.74s)]
*  the current regime of care for a patient is an academic pursuit. It's not an industrial pursuit. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1157.38s)]
*  As we spent the last year and a half or so thinking through and doing our homework, our diligence [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1163.5400000000002s)]
*  on genetic conditions of the liver, we were quite excited to find several diseases that we thought [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1169.46s)]
*  were truly underserved by current standards of care and were uniquely, potentially uniquely [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1175.7800000000002s)]
*  addressed by integrase or ligase-medium PGI. On the cell therapy side, same thing. We said, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1182.02s)]
*  look, if we can truly flexibly manipulate cells, reprogram them to be therapeutics, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1188.1s)]
*  and we know one else can, that'll only ever be academic unless we can create a truly [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1193.54s)]
*  differentiated medicine. And so we were excited to design our first cellular therapy, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1197.54s)]
*  which is now in production, and believe that it has the potential to be a best in class [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1203.78s)]
*  for patients with autoimmune disease specifically. In that regard, what would represent success for [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1208.5s)]
*  you? Is that completely curing? Is it managing? Yeah, I think in an ideal world, these are [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1214.9s)]
*  curative therapies. It's interesting. When I started in the industry in 2011, when I finished [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1220.74s)]
*  my clinical training here in Boston, we never used the word cure unless it was for an antiviral or an [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1226.02s)]
*  antibiotic, a vaccine or an antibiotic. And we are now on the cusp of considering cure for numerous [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1231.78s)]
*  diseases. And so I think that evolution of biopharma in the last 10 to 12, 13 years is staggering, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1240.1s)]
*  that we can actually contemplate curing certain diseases. And so when we set out into evaluating [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1248.02s)]
*  disease, we ask several questions. One is, is a disease that is well served by current modalities, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1254.9s)]
*  either pills, injectables, or silencing RNA technologies, or even prior instances of genome [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1262.18s)]
*  editing technologies? If they're well suited, then we don't want to go after them. The second [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1271.14s)]
*  question we ask is, can we truly cure this disease by fixing the DNA or reprogramming the DNA? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1275.0600000000002s)]
*  And if we can't answer both of those questions in a supportive manner, then we don't go after [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1283.14s)]
*  that disease. So everything we try to do at Tome really is with this intent to cure, or at least [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1287.7s)]
*  provide multi-year, very long lasting, durable disease control. When it comes to a lot of cell [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1292.66s)]
*  and gene therapies, cost and scalability are both issues. Have you addressed or looking to address [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1300.1000000000001s)]
*  that? We will need to because we are still in preclinical scale up development. Costs are still [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1306.66s)]
*  very, very high. It's part of why we have to raise quite a bit of capital, much of which goes to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1313.78s)]
*  external vendors who help us with animal testing or manufacturing, etc. But as we scale towards [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1319.14s)]
*  clinical testing, and particularly the later phases of clinical testing, phase two and phase three, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1327.38s)]
*  we are already beginning to think about how we bring down the cost of materials to therefore [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1332.5s)]
*  contain the cost of the drugs themselves. I think curative or durable clinical effect from [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1336.58s)]
*  genomic therapies will always command a premium price simply because they are a one and done. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1343.6999999999998s)]
*  And they should be compared not to the cost of an individual pill or an individual injectable, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1349.54s)]
*  but what is the cost of that pill or the injectable over the multi-years, if not the lifespan, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1356.8999999999999s)]
*  that an individual would be paying for a drug that ordinarily would control, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1362.5s)]
*  but in this case is a one and done. And so the initial sticker price will always be higher. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1367.06s)]
*  But I am, again, as a practicing physician, I believe in value-based care. And I believe on [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1371.7s)]
*  balance amortized, the cost of the drug should be within the bounds of the value to the patient and [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1376.82s)]
*  to society over the years by which the drug is efficacious, whether you're taking that drug [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1385.3s)]
*  every day or it's a one and done, but with always the endeavor to control the cost as much as [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1390.18s)]
*  possible. And a lot of that goes into the cost of manufacturing. These are some of the most, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1395.14s)]
*  if not the most complex drug products ever envisioned, multi-component, very expensive [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1401.54s)]
*  components like pieces of DNA, pieces of lipid, pieces of virus. They are highly complex to [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1409.3s)]
*  manufacture. So cost is something where even though we're very far away from commercialization, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1416.26s)]
*  we're already beginning to think about how we scale our manufacturing to minimize cost to the [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1422.66s)]
*  patient. I think quite often there's a sort of a linear approach to cost in so far as it's how [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1426.66s)]
*  much does this treatment cost? And that just becomes the, I guess, the overall discussion. But [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1434.74s)]
*  as you said, you have to consider when families have to give up jobs to look after people or [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1440.98s)]
*  the cost of hospital stays. And there are so many other economic issues that impact upon the cost [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1447.3000000000002s)]
*  that it's very difficult to quantify. I completely agree with you. There are [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1454.9s)]
*  professional organizations like NICE in Europe and ICER here in the U.S. who do that work. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1459.8600000000001s)]
*  And there are many academics as well at the Chan School of Public Health within the Harvard [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1466.42s)]
*  ecosystem where I work who do that work and do that work the best that they can. I think [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1471.46s)]
*  the public discourse often focuses on the top line sticker price. And I certainly think the disparities [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1476.34s)]
*  of cost between different countries is of concern. But I also do think there's a rational argument [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1482.26s)]
*  for curative therapies to have a higher sticker price because of the value they deliver to a [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1488.5s)]
*  patient, their family to your point and to society. So I think, you know, cooler heads prevail. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1493.38s)]
*  I think these are medicines that society can afford. But I also think we have to be careful [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1498.2600000000002s)]
*  to try to contain those costs and have those value based discussions with multiple territories and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1504.2600000000002s)]
*  multiple countries and not just rely on any one territory or country to float the cost for the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1510.3400000000001s)]
*  rest of the world. I know that in looking through some of the literature on your website, it [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1515.14s)]
*  mentions this as being the final chapter in genomic medicine. I wonder if you could explain [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1521.46s)]
*  that and maybe also what the implication is of that for other companies that might be entering [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1526.82s)]
*  this area and might look at that and think, what are we doing then? Well, I think we usually get a [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1532.3400000000001s)]
*  snicker saying, yeah, is that a little bit of a hubris? And, you know, we thought long and hard [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1539.38s)]
*  before we decided to use that phraseology. And I will quote from our chief science officer who said, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1543.78s)]
*  well, what tool are we missing after PGI? If you can now put any size piece of DNA into the genome, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1552.8999999999999s)]
*  exactly where you want it to go, it could be a portion of a gene, a gene, it could be a gene [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1561.78s)]
*  circuit, could be multiple genetic elements. What are we missing at that point? And I would argue [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1566.02s)]
*  we're not. At that point, it's really hard to imagine what further capability a genomic drug [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1572.18s)]
*  developer could need. Now, not to say there aren't improvements to be made. These systems [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1580.5s)]
*  are multi-component. They are complex. They are expensive to make. And certainly simplification [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1584.9s)]
*  of these systems is a laudable goal and something that our platform team works on as we think about [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1590.3400000000001s)]
*  Generation 2 and 3 and beyond of PGI. As for technology that have come before us, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1596.1s)]
*  traditional gene therapies, CRISPR-Cas9 based technologies, base editing, prime editing, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1601.94s)]
*  like I said before, I think they will have their place. And I think there are some very [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1608.42s)]
*  important medicines that will come from these technologies. But the reason I, at this point [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1613.06s)]
*  in my career, have chosen to put my blood, sweat and tears into Tome is because I believe we're [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1618.98s)]
*  at a critical point in the evolution of genetic medicines writ large. If we think about any [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1625.62s)]
*  human industrial arena, not just in biopharma, but also in technologies, in industrial technologies, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1633.2199999999998s)]
*  internet technologies, artificial intelligence, the first instance of a technology was never the [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1642.6599999999999s)]
*  one that defined the field. Large language models are not the first instance of AI. AI has been [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1648.82s)]
*  around for decades, if not most of a generation. The iPhone was not the first instance of a cell [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1653.78s)]
*  phone slash internet communicator. Even as we think about the internal combustion engine, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1659.7s)]
*  the commoditization and the generalization of the automobile did not rest on the first example. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1664.42s)]
*  Even electric cars have gone through their iterations over time. And my impression at [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1670.42s)]
*  looking at, again, as an outsider coming into this field, is that we look back to traditional [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1676.26s)]
*  gene therapies dating back to the 90s through to the 2012 discovery of CRISPR-Cas9. Many of [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1682.02s)]
*  these technologies were the heroic endeavors by academics and the biopharma industry to realize [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1689.94s)]
*  the full potential of genetic medicines, but the tools were very limited. And when I look at PGI, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1697.78s)]
*  specifically, I see it as that final maturation of the technologies, which will allow us to deploy [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1702.74s)]
*  genetic medicines, both cell and gene therapies, with the kind of breath that so far have been [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1710.74s)]
*  relegated to biologic large molecules, chemical-based small molecules, and RNA therapeutics. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1717.86s)]
*  And so when we say the final chapter, I think it is a question of what are we missing? We can't [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1724.98s)]
*  think of another tool, another capability that we're missing. And once you can flexibly edit the DNA, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1730.34s)]
*  most of the other technologies look limited in some way. And so that's why we call it the final [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1736.58s)]
*  chapter. You mentioned about fine-tuning and improving over time. Will that all come from [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1741.06s)]
*  within your company, or is the capacity for other companies or other academics to be involved in [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1748.02s)]
*  developing this further? At this point, just given this field of programmability, where we believe [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1754.5s)]
*  we are the leaders in that space, we're doing much of that innovation here. We are constantly [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1764.58s)]
*  monitoring and speaking with academics who we believe may have work that will enhance what [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1771.06s)]
*  we're doing. And we are, in some instances, acquiring those technologies, like with Replace, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1777.62s)]
*  or partnering with those academics who believe they can augment what we're doing. And we are [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1782.6599999999999s)]
*  certainly interested in partnering with large pharmaceutical companies who can help us expand [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1787.4599999999998s)]
*  the reach of the technology far beyond what we can do. Although, as you've said, we've raised [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1792.1799999999998s)]
*  a sizable quantum of capital, we cannot, with the capital we have, execute even on all of our own [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1797.4599999999998s)]
*  ideas. And there are probably many applications outside of the brain trust here at Tome that [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1804.1799999999998s)]
*  would have applications we haven't even considered yet. So we are a science-first organization, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1810.5s)]
*  and we certainly understand that the best ideas in the service of patients or what should move [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1816.1799999999998s)]
*  forward, those may or may not come from within Tome. Sure. You've mentioned Replace Therapeutics [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1821.38s)]
*  and the acquisition. Could you tell me what the company does and why you took it over and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1827.94s)]
*  what that means for Tome going forward? Yeah, Replace was the organization that invented ligase [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1832.8200000000002s)]
*  mediated PGI. And so it's very complementary, as we've talked about in this conversation, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1838.74s)]
*  very complementary to what we were doing with integrase mediated PGI, but in those smaller [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1842.66s)]
*  scale edits, tens to hundreds of base pairs. And so we were actually approached by the organization [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1847.54s)]
*  who recognized that what they were working on, which was in stealth at the time, was very [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1852.82s)]
*  complementary to what we're doing. And so in a matter of months, there was alignment in terms of [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1857.22s)]
*  combining our efforts. And at the end of last year, we consummated that acquisition. And so Replace [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1862.9s)]
*  really brought to us that capability with a simpler system than integrase mediated PGI to make those [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1868.02s)]
*  smaller edits that are on the scale of portions of the gene rather than integrase mediated PGI, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1874.1s)]
*  which is really much more suited to full gene or multi-gene edits. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1879.62s)]
*  Obviously, the sky's the limit, it seems like, for the company. So what are the next steps? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1884.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so we are about two and a half years into operations at the company. We'll begin presenting [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1890.58s)]
*  and releasing our data in the course of this year, as well as some of the specific diseases [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1896.6599999999999s)]
*  we'd like to go after. And so we believe that both for integrative gene therapies and for cell [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1900.42s)]
*  therapies, basic de-risking and validation of PGI for the creation of integrative gene therapies [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1906.42s)]
*  and cell therapies is complete. We've done enough preclinical work and enough industrialization [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1915.7s)]
*  of the scale-up and manufacturing processes that we feel very comfortable that these are going to be [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1921.46s)]
*  bona fide and powerful methods for designing new drugs. And so now we're in the process [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1929.06s)]
*  of nominating those drug programs. And as we do so, we'll begin releasing in the public domain, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1934.5s)]
*  our data, the diseases we're going after and the kind of therapeutic potential we think those [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1941.06s)]
*  programs will have. Some really compelling science there and a very interesting conversation, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1945.3799999999999s)]
*  and definitely a company to watch out for to see how this develops later in the year and beyond. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1956.66s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu. And I hope wherever [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1963.78s)]
*  in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. Thanks for listening, and I hope you'll [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE7B55Gorw&t=1971.0600000000002s)]
