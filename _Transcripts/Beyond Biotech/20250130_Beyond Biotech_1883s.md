Video Description: Solid tumors present a big challenge for current treatments. However, a new approach might provide the answers - Tumor Activated Therapy. 

By targeting specific proteins common in all solid tumor micro-environments, Seekyo Therapeutics' scientists think this can induce self-destruction of the tumor itself. Seekyo’s lead therapy, SKY01, can only be activated within the tumor, making it a highly-targeted solution.

This differentiated approach overcomes the limits of existing treatments, such as small molecule or antibody-drug conjugates. It could also be more cost effective than many advanced, far cell and gene therapy alternatives. 

Seekyo Therapeutics is looking for clinical entry to target four of the more challenging solid cancers - pancreas, TNBC, colorectal and lung, in an umbrella PhI/IIa. This will demonstrate safety and initial efficacy readings whilst at the same time defining the lead indication to progress to later-stage development. 

This week, our guest is Seekyo Therapeutics’ CEO, Oury Chetboun.

# Can Tumor Activated Therapy kill solid tumors?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 128. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=16.0s)]
*  This week we're looking at a novel approach to tackling solid tumors and that is through [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=20.36s)]
*  a new technique called tumor activated therapy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=26.36s)]
*  It's been developed by Cikyo Therapeutics and to tell us about it is the company's CEO, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Rui Shetbun. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=36.36s)]
*  So I guess the first question then is if you could give me a bit of background about the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=37.36s)]
*  company and the history of Cikyo Therapeutics. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=42.36s)]
*  Thank you very much Jim for having me today. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=45.36s)]
*  Today, I mean Cikyo is actually developing a new modality to treat cancer and to treat [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=50.36s)]
*  solid tumors for very difficult reasons that the solutions that were brought and are being [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=56.96s)]
*  today on the oncologist have limitations. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=63.86s)]
*  What we thought at Cikyo was to find a new way, new modality with existing products, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=69.06s)]
*  existing drugs to make them optimized and more than that to find a way to overcome one [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=75.36s)]
*  of the key limitations which is the heterogeneity within the cancer cells, within the tumor [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=83.96s)]
*  itself. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=91.76s)]
*  How do you get to that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=92.76s)]
*  It's all about Cikyo today. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  So the company was created about six years ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=96.36s)]
*  We made very nice progress in developing drugs, diagnostics, in generating unbelievable [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=100.0s)]
*  data on mice and dogs and also in paving the way for our next steps which is towards the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=107.7s)]
*  clinics. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=116.0s)]
*  What are the challenges when it comes to tackling solid tumors? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=117.0s)]
*  The key challenge today is actually to A, get inside the tumor and B, to avoid the side [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=122.5s)]
*  effects. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=131.0s)]
*  We all know the chemotherapy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=132.0s)]
*  We all know that this is the only solution, almost only solution today but they have a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=134.3s)]
*  real strong drawbacks which are the side effects induced. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=139.0s)]
*  On the other hand, of the spectrum you have what we call targeted therapy which really [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=143.0s)]
*  is to target a specific marker on the cancer surface cell. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=150.0s)]
*  However, when it comes to the famous heterogeneity, you may have cells with cancer cells with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=157.0s)]
*  not that marker. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=162.6s)]
*  So you can't target them and then you end it in a situation where you have to increase [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=164.5s)]
*  the doses, you have to increase the also side effects with again limitation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=169.0s)]
*  So really one of the drawbacks today is the ability to find something which is efficient [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=176.4s)]
*  and safe at the same time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=183.4s)]
*  And I think and I strongly believe that what CQO is bringing to the marketplace would cover [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=185.0s)]
*  both aspects, efficacy and safe at the same time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=191.4s)]
*  Could you explain in a bit more detail what tumor activated therapy is and how it works? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=197.4s)]
*  The concept behind is actually to use the tumor itself to allow the product to get [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=204.9s)]
*  to the target and to be only activated at the tumor site. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=211.9s)]
*  So in fact what we do is to use the property induced by the tumor itself to generate its [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=215.9s)]
*  own destruction. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=223.9s)]
*  So in a very simple way, Skyone has been designed to A, being able to use the albumin [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=224.9s)]
*  as a drug driver which increases tremendously the pharmacokinetic of Skyone and allows Skyone [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=234.9s)]
*  to get directly to the tumor microenvironment. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=241.9s)]
*  This is one step. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=245.9s)]
*  But once in the tumor, you also need to control the release of the active component, the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=247.9s)]
*  anti-cancer agent. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=254.9s)]
*  So either you don't control, which is bad luck because that induced side effects, or [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=256.9s)]
*  you tend to have a reply which is like in a computer, 0, 1. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=262.9s)]
*  It's exactly how we designed Skyone with the ability to only be activated at the tumor [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=267.9s)]
*  site. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=273.9s)]
*  And the protein which actually induced the activation at the tumor site is the protein [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=274.9s)]
*  which is only expressed in the tumor microenvironment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=280.9s)]
*  So you don't get it anywhere else. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=284.9s)]
*  So you're not activated anywhere else. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=286.9s)]
*  And that's really a key element of the activation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=288.9s)]
*  So Skyone is designed to be activated only at the tumor site. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=291.9s)]
*  And once Skyone is in contact with that functional protein, then you induce the release. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=295.9s)]
*  And the targeting of the cancer cells. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=303.9s)]
*  One of the beauty actually of Skyone is that those functional protein that we use and which [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=307.9s)]
*  induce this answer, yes, no, 0, 1, those proteins are present in all type of solid tumors. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=314.9s)]
*  So that means on a principle that Skyone can be activated and can be efficient in pancreas, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=322.9s)]
*  in triple negative breast cancer, in lung and colorectal or even in cervix cancer. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=331.9s)]
*  And actually we at CQO have data of efficacy in all those types of solid tumor, the one [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=338.9s)]
*  I mentioned. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=346.9s)]
*  So with one product, you get different indications. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=347.9s)]
*  And I believe that for a company, an early stage company like ours, it's just something [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=351.9s)]
*  unbelievable because we also have behind tremendous data on the efficacy, data that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=357.9s)]
*  we've never seen before in the literature. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=365.9s)]
*  And what is Skyone and how does that work within that tumor environment? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=368.9s)]
*  So Skyone is a chemical structure based on a click chemistry. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=374.9s)]
*  So very easy to create. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=378.9s)]
*  Click chemistry is a three arm compounds in every single arm. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=380.9s)]
*  You have a branch. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=385.9s)]
*  You also have a linker, which is an auto immolative linker. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=387.9s)]
*  So this linker will release the payload of interest. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=393.9s)]
*  In our case, it's one of the most toxic payload called Aristatin E. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=397.9s)]
*  And that release is induced by a glucose structure. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=404.9s)]
*  So once the enzyme, which is the functional protein, reaches the arm of Skyone, then it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=409.9s)]
*  would recognize this activation structure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=417.9s)]
*  And that activation structure will induce automatic release of the payload. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=420.9s)]
*  So that's the way we design. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=426.9s)]
*  So we even optimize the drug ratio. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=428.9s)]
*  What we call drug ratio, DAR, is usually one to one. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=431.9s)]
*  So you have one molecule for one payload. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=436.9s)]
*  In our case, we have one molecule for three payloads. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=439.9s)]
*  That means we are able to deliver a higher concentration of the active agent, the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=443.9s)]
*  anti-cancer agent. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=449.9s)]
*  And just for your information, but Aristatin E is a well-known high toxic drug, which [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=450.9s)]
*  induce antimidotic effects. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=457.9s)]
*  So that induce the apoptosis of the cancer cells. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=460.9s)]
*  And so what happens to the cancer cells? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=464.9s)]
*  Are they destroyed? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=467.9s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=469.9s)]
*  Well, once the payload, the Aristatin penetrates passively inside the cancer cell, then it [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=471.9s)]
*  will induce the antimidotic effect. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=477.9s)]
*  So the cell will not be able to carry on its multiplication. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=480.9s)]
*  And then the cells is auto destroyed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=485.9s)]
*  So does that mean that the tumor itself vanishes or shrinks or is controlled? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=489.9s)]
*  It will shrink at first and then it will vanish in a second step. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=495.9s)]
*  We've done and we carried experiments on what they called PDX. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=500.9s)]
*  PDX is actually real tumor from real patients with all the tumor microenvironment implanted [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=505.9s)]
*  in mice. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=513.9s)]
*  So you have a human guy's tumor inside a model in mice. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=514.9s)]
*  We let the tumor grow. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=519.9s)]
*  And then we did three things. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=522.9s)]
*  We did a control. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=524.9s)]
*  So we did nothing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=525.9s)]
*  We use the standard of care, the current standard of care for pancreas treatment, which is the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=527.9s)]
*  gentitabine. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=532.9s)]
*  And in that case, we saw a slight reduction of the speed of the tumor volume. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=534.9s)]
*  So it's the average expectation. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=541.9s)]
*  So we know that gentitabine is not so efficient today with pancreatic patients. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=544.9s)]
*  And in the third group, we use Skyone. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=549.9s)]
*  We injected Skyone only once. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=553.9s)]
*  And even after the initial injection at the concentration, which is not the highest [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=555.9s)]
*  concentration we can go for, we saw already a decrease of the tumor. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=560.9s)]
*  So we did that with nine different PDX. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=567.9s)]
*  And in 55% of those groups of mice treated with Skyone, we saw a complete vanish of the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=570.9s)]
*  tumor. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=580.9s)]
*  So a full remission for over 55% of the mice. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=581.9s)]
*  Well, of course, and that's of course the key points too, we have no side effects. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=586.9s)]
*  And how do you deliver that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=591.9s)]
*  Do you inject directly into the tumor? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=593.9s)]
*  It's actually a very important question. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=595.9s)]
*  It's an IV injection. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=598.9s)]
*  So we use the drug Skyone IV injected. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=599.9s)]
*  And once in the bloodstream, it will link to the albumin of the patient inside the bloodstream. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=604.9s)]
*  So nothing is done outside. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=610.9s)]
*  And that's also very beneficial for the patient. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=612.9s)]
*  Are there any other companies utilizing similar techniques or the same technique? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=615.9s)]
*  The spirits, some of them are trying with auto-immolative or beta-agriculonidase enzyme. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=622.9s)]
*  And that they would be in the spirit of ADC. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=630.9s)]
*  Without getting back to what we see as limitation of ADC, such as antibody antigen recondition, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=633.9s)]
*  penetration of the whole antibody inside the cell before being activated. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=640.9s)]
*  Without considering that, we today are the only ones to have at the same time such a high selectivity in terms of activation, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=644.9s)]
*  the famous yes-no I mentioned before, and not being dependent of any surface cell marker. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=654.9s)]
*  So we are able to activate without being dependent of any marker. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=662.9s)]
*  Because again, if you are an ADC, you target CD30 or whatever 31, but you don't find it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=667.9s)]
*  Even though the cell is a cancer cell, then you can't penetrate. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=674.9s)]
*  You can't do anything. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=678.9s)]
*  We, in our case, are not dependent on that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=679.9s)]
*  So today we are the only ones to have that double unique position, blue sky position, I would call it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=682.9s)]
*  What are the other treatments that are being developed elsewhere to take on solid tumors? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=689.9s)]
*  Is it the same as we're currently using? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=696.9s)]
*  I'm not an ADC expert, I would say. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=699.9s)]
*  But if you look at the ADC approved so far, we're talking here about over 17 different drugs. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=702.9s)]
*  Most of them are not used in solid tumor. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=710.9s)]
*  There's only two or even three used for the solid tumors. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=715.9s)]
*  And the reason being, again, the mechanism of action, the ability to penetrate solid tumor, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=719.9s)]
*  the efficacy in those type of treatments. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=724.9s)]
*  So pancreas, triple negative are how to treat cancer. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=728.9s)]
*  And the reason being that the proposed solutions are not efficient enough. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=732.9s)]
*  There are other options. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=738.9s)]
*  There are, of course, the historical chemotherapy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=740.9s)]
*  There's also the new ADC I mentioned. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=744.9s)]
*  There are other options that are being developed. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=747.9s)]
*  There are a few other solutions. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=750.9s)]
*  But to have efficacy and safety, we haven't seen much today. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=752.9s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=758.9s)]
*  And you also have to recall that people tend to think that only one drug will cover all types of patients within the same medication, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=759.9s)]
*  which is actually not true. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=768.9s)]
*  There are stage of development, there are individual reaction and ability. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=770.9s)]
*  And all these things make, or even truer, what we call in French, a place under the sun. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=774.9s)]
*  So all solutions will be welcome as long as it fits the toolbox of oncologists. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=781.9s)]
*  And I guess some of those treatments are just prolonging life by a few months. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=787.9s)]
*  So it's good to develop things that are hopefully more long lasting than that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=793.9s)]
*  Well, indeed, if you look at the Braxan, if you look at GenC Tabin, again, for pancreatic cancer, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=798.9s)]
*  it's exactly we buy a few days, a few weeks or even a few months. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=804.9s)]
*  But you don't see cure, you don't see remission, you don't see something which would allow the patient, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=809.9s)]
*  and especially for pancreatic cancer where you detect it's already late, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=816.9s)]
*  you don't see something which is subject to give hope to patients. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=820.9s)]
*  You mentioned some of the animal testing that you've been doing. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=825.9s)]
*  Where are you at on the clinical trial pathway? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=830.9s)]
*  Well, we are one, I would call it one and a half step behind that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=834.9s)]
*  One and a half means that we've done all the animal testing, non-regulatory one. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=839.9s)]
*  We need to redo the same thing under regulatory path, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=845.9s)]
*  which means that we need to do the GMP production to do exactly the same drugs and mice, rats that we've done, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=849.9s)]
*  and we need to find a bit more animals, but that's the regulatory obligation. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=858.9s)]
*  And then we will find the IND. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=864.9s)]
*  So that's my half way. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=866.9s)]
*  And then with IND, we will be able to move into the clinics with a nice clinical design that we thought [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=868.9s)]
*  with the help of experts, I would say oncologists experts, which is kind of umbrella trial, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=876.9s)]
*  because again, the mechanism of action, if you recall, is ubiquitous in all types of solid tumors. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=882.9s)]
*  That means we could potentially treat pancreatic triple negative lung colorectal cancer patients with the same drug. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=889.9s)]
*  So under an umbrella trial, we will be able to recruit those type of indications [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=897.9s)]
*  and the outcome of that for the maximum tolerative dose phase. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=904.9s)]
*  And then the outcome of that will allow us to go either on an expansion phase for one indication or even two indications [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=908.9s)]
*  and then reach a kind of phase one two, which as we are an oncology product, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=917.9s)]
*  which allows us not to use at the very beginning healthy patients first, as we would do for other type of pathology. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=924.9s)]
*  Do you have any kind of timeline on when you might be able to start human trials? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=932.9s)]
*  Let's consider that today one of the key elements, the ability to close our current fundraising. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=939.9s)]
*  So if I have the money in pocket today or even yesterday, which would have been nicer, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=947.9s)]
*  I would say that it would take us a good year to get to the door of the clinics, a good year. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=953.9s)]
*  And then an extra one and a half or even two years to have all the recruitment done and the data generated for this phase one two. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=960.9s)]
*  Being able to recruit these four type of indication at the same time is the way to speed up the reach to the next step. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=970.9s)]
*  Does this technique have applications with other types of cancer or even other different diseases potentially? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=981.9s)]
*  Other type of cancer within the solid tumor range, yes, that's for sure. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=989.9s)]
*  We can increase that. Other indication actually, let's put that a different way. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=995.9s)]
*  We've got a drug which is called Skyone, which delivered today a cytotoxic drug. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1000.9s)]
*  That's the R-Statin E I mentioned. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1006.9s)]
*  But we, because we have a platform in fact, are able to change instead of using R-Statin E, we can use something else. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1009.9s)]
*  In the first step, and we are working on that, instead of using a cytotoxic, a usual, I would call it cytotoxic drug, to use an immunostimulant drug. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1018.9s)]
*  And that drug actually is being developed. It's called Sky2. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1028.9s)]
*  Sky2 would potentially have the potential to work on its own, but also in synergy with Skyone. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1033.9s)]
*  And Skyone will leverage the effect of Sky2, and Sky2 will leverage the effect of Skyone to treat the patient. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1042.9s)]
*  That's part of the answer. And one can dream of, of course, but that's a bit more of science fiction, to use the platform and its ability to control the release for all the type of indications. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1049.9s)]
*  That's something that we are thinking, I would say, on a paper, but has, of course, still to be generated, because we need to find and to be sure that the triggering agent is present in the disease and only in the disease, like we have with loose functional protein in the tumor and not anywhere else. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1063.9s)]
*  That's the trigger. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1085.9s)]
*  I guess one of the main issues, although the most important thing is being able to help people, but clearly the cost of treatment is always going to be a consideration. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1087.9s)]
*  How would you see your treatment fitting in there? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1099.9s)]
*  I need to compare to existing very expensive treatments, one of them being the antibody drugs conjugates. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1102.9s)]
*  Those are very expensive because you have to develop an antibody antigen and at least the antibody part and all these things that goes around. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1110.9s)]
*  We at CQ have developed a simple structure safe, which can be controlled, which can be accumulated on the chemical structure called, and that was the Nobel Prize, the click chemistry. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1119.9s)]
*  Two years ago, the Nobel Prize was given for click chemistry, and we actually have developed that structure, which is a click chemistry based with only few steps of production and three GMP steps. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1134.9s)]
*  So that tremendously reduced the cost, the overall cost of production, and therefore at the very end for the health system and then for the patient, it would obviously be a very affordable drug. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1149.9s)]
*  Even if you include the premium because we are supposed to be innovative, we are supposed to be something which will disrupt the market, but there's always a nice place between the former and very old and not expensive drug like gencitabine and something very posh, which is at the very end, which has its own limitation, as I mentioned before. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1164.9s)]
*  I think we are a very affordable, quick to reach solution for those patients who are desperately looking for something else. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1189.9s)]
*  When it comes to the patient themselves and the end goal here, is it to just extend life more or is it to completely get rid of these cancers and not consider them to be cured? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1198.9s)]
*  There's two parts of that in my reply. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1212.9s)]
*  The first one, if I look at the data we've got on mice, and again, people would say mice is not human, I agree, but there are reasons where we believe that the data we will see in human will be even better than in mice for technical reasons, which I will not develop today. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1216.9s)]
*  But if I look at the data we've got on PDX on mice, we saw that even with very difficult pancreatic cancer, we are able to cure the mice and more than 50% of the groups. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1232.9s)]
*  That's the remission. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1246.9s)]
*  And the other part, we also carried experiment where we started with very large tumor, again, in Pneucus and NN, very large, that usually you can't do anything with that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1249.9s)]
*  And by using only one injection of Skyone over a few days, we saw a shrunk of the volume of the tumor. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1261.9s)]
*  So again, I cannot project today, and it would be science fiction to project into humans, but based on the data, based on an improved system pharmacokinetic with humans in comparison to mice for reasons like the albumin and other reasons, we believe that the data we'll see in humans will be even more efficient than we can see today. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1268.9s)]
*  Either full remission or even the reduction of volume at the size where potentially a surgery could take place. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1291.9s)]
*  It would mean that in all cases, increasing the life projection number of days or increasing the quality or potentially giving the hope to patients that they will just get rid of that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1299.9s)]
*  And would you have to give a series of treatments or would it just be one treatment? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1317.9s)]
*  Again, based on the data we've got on mice, after three injections, every single injection taking place every three weeks, three injections, we saw the full remission on mice. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1323.9s)]
*  Three weeks and then you're done. That doesn't mean if you look at the long run, you would not need an injection about one month later. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1335.9s)]
*  But that does mean, though, that you don't have to have the patient every single day at the hospital every single week or every single month. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1344.9s)]
*  It could be something which has given more spaces for a real and proper life and a better time to recover between two treatments. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1354.9s)]
*  And in the studies that you've done so far, does the size of the tumor impact the number of treatments that you have to have? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1364.9s)]
*  We have decided in carrying this experiment to start the treatment only at the massive size of the tumor. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1374.9s)]
*  We didn't try several once in between, but we started at the size in order to be sure that we really have efficacy at a size which is not compatible to even the life of mice. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1383.9s)]
*  And despite that, we saw an increase in survival of those mice. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1396.9s)]
*  So I would say that if you go for the largest, then you could expect to get something in between, smaller, so something which would be detected before. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1402.9s)]
*  And at one point, yes, there's a correlation between the size of the tumor and the number of injection. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1412.9s)]
*  Although, as I said before, on large tumor in mice, only one injection, but if you live 70 days, in that case, that was the experiment, you saw a shrug which was kind of one 10 out of the initial tumor volume. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1421.9s)]
*  Is there anything else that you have in your pipeline? You mentioned SCI-2. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1439.9s)]
*  That's also the beauty of an early stage like ours company. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1445.9s)]
*  It's to have a platform. That platform has generated SCI-1, it's generating SCI-2, can generate other things. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1449.9s)]
*  We have had some partnership with a large biotech company to develop their own product on our platform. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1457.9s)]
*  So that's the platform concept, which is nice to have, because it gives a high potential to the company, but also it does generate revenue as well. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1465.9s)]
*  We are developing a diagnostic tool which enable us or potentially will enable us to stratify the patient, making sure that before they get into the treatment, they will be good to respond to the treatments. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1474.9s)]
*  And that is also a nice tool, not only for the treatment, but also because we know that at one point in time, the health system would like and would love to see such a tool in order to pay. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1487.9s)]
*  Making sure that the patient will not get a not appropriate treatment and will spend the money and the life of the patient for nothing. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1505.9s)]
*  But we have a targeted therapy, something which is clear from the beginning that he has a high rate of success. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1513.9s)]
*  You mentioned the fundraising and the partnerships. How is that going and what's the reaction like to what you're doing? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1522.9s)]
*  Because it seems like this is a massive leap forward. I assume that there's great interest in what you're doing? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1529.9s)]
*  If I put myself as a venture guy, I would say on the technical, on the development, on everything on the paper, it's really wonderful. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1535.9s)]
*  But as a venture guy, I'm always actually worried about real new things. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1546.9s)]
*  It would have been nicer if I were in the ADC world, straightforward and do ADC. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1553.9s)]
*  Well, it's ADC. Well, sure, it's got to work, even if it doesn't work. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1559.9s)]
*  But at least it's on a track where we know that others are putting money. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1565.9s)]
*  So let's do the sheep like others and put money on the way we know others have put. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1569.9s)]
*  If you come from the innovation part, which I came from, you bring something different within the same field. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1576.9s)]
*  So you need to prove even more than the others. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1582.9s)]
*  That's the reason why we had collected so much data and we were luxury to have that kind of nice data. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1585.9s)]
*  So the fundraising is very exciting. We want to innovate. We have already a syndicate. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1592.9s)]
*  We still need to work on the lead investor. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1599.9s)]
*  What I'm saying here is that once this could happen, which hopefully soon, then we will have no issue on finding money. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1601.9s)]
*  We've done so far fundraising with business angels. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1611.9s)]
*  So they are kind of expert, not being as expert as VC. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1615.9s)]
*  They have deep pocket, but not as VC. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1620.9s)]
*  They were the right guy, the right appropriate guys to invest at early stage. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1623.9s)]
*  Now moving to a more advanced stage, which is toward the clinics, we need to increase our audience. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1628.9s)]
*  So I'm very, very confident actually based on the data, based on the map we have that will soon close the fundraising. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1636.9s)]
*  Are you making lots of presentations at events? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1646.9s)]
*  And if so, what's the reaction like to what you're telling people? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1651.9s)]
*  I do make, but on a personal matter, that's my tips to the audience. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1656.9s)]
*  When you're a young company, when you're an early stage company, it's good to have face to face meetings. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1663.9s)]
*  It's good to meet with individuals rather than going outside and doing a general presentation. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1672.9s)]
*  Because when you are face to face, you can see the reaction, you can see the question, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1677.9s)]
*  you can answer those questions to the contrary of a large audience. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1683.9s)]
*  And for something which is again, somehow disruptive, you need to educate people. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1688.9s)]
*  You can't do that in front of a large audience. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1694.9s)]
*  That's very nice for a large company like GSK presenting their new data. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1696.9s)]
*  No one will challenge. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1701.9s)]
*  When you are in front of a guy or a lady, of course, you have to explain to convince you, you see his reaction or her reaction. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1703.9s)]
*  And then you can adjust. You also get a feedback. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1712.9s)]
*  And that's very important too. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1715.9s)]
*  Because then the next round, you will have adjusted according to the feedback you heard. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1717.9s)]
*  And you will be even more efficient. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1723.9s)]
*  So yes, I do spend a lot of time meeting with people, educating them, meeting once, twice, even three times [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1725.9s)]
*  before the considerate as entering their full due diligence process, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1732.9s)]
*  before bringing our dossier to the internal committee. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1737.9s)]
*  So it's a lot of education, a lot of time spent, a lot of dedication as well. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1742.9s)]
*  But it's really, really exciting. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1746.9s)]
*  One last point, and it won't be a funny one, but at the very end of that, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1748.9s)]
*  all the work we are putting together, the company, but also investor, whoever you want, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1755.9s)]
*  you have to recall there, we're talking here about patients, which are the final user. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1760.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, I keep receiving every two weeks an email or call from relatives who has patients in late stage, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1764.9s)]
*  mostly in pancreas or in triple negative, asking whether they can be enrolled in our clinical trial. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1775.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, because we haven't yet got the money in bank, my answer is not yet. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1781.9s)]
*  We need to follow regulatory rules. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1788.9s)]
*  We need to do that step and the following and so on. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1790.9s)]
*  So the sooner we can do the fundraising, the larger the fundraising is made, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1793.9s)]
*  the sooner we can reach those patients either for a normal, I would call it normal treatment, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1800.9s)]
*  or even to be enrolled in a solution, which for some of them could be the last proposal. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1808.9s)]
*  And that's something I would like to send to the investor that investing is important, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1814.9s)]
*  investing in innovation is crucial, but you have to take some real risk. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1821.9s)]
*  It's not because you are called VC that you're really taking risk. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1826.9s)]
*  If the new tumor-activated therapy approach comes to fruition [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1836.9s)]
*  and is better and cheaper than current standards of care treatment, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1841.9s)]
*  then hopefully great news and definitely a company to watch as it goes through the clinical trial stages. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1845.9s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1852.9s)]
*  and I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1858.9s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhTBYOC7tTQ&t=1862.9s)]
