Video Description: C4 Therapeutics (C4T) is a leader in the targeted protein degradation (TPD) field, with two oncology drug candidates currently in clinical trials and collaborations with pharma companies like Merck, Biogen and Roche. 


The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company is dedicated to creating a new generation of medicines using its TORPEDO platform to design and optimize small-molecule medicines to address difficult-to-treat diseases. 


TORPEDO can design molecular glues and heterobifunctional degraders, giving C4T the capability of targeting almost any disease-causing protein. 


C4T’s degrader medicines are designed to harness the body’s natural protein recycling system to rapidly degrade disease-causing proteins, offering the potential to overcome drug resistance, drug undruggable targets and improve patient outcomes.


C4T is led by CEO and president Andrew Hirsch, who is this week’s guest on the podcast.

# Harnessing the body’s natural targeted protein degradation system to treat diseases
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 112. I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. And the subject this week is targeted protein degradation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=17.48s)]
*  or TPD. C4 Therapeutics, shortened to C4T, is a leader in the TPD field with two oncology [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=24.94s)]
*  drug candidates currently in clinical trials and collaborations with pharma companies including [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=34.18s)]
*  Merck, Biogen and Roche. The company's proprietary degrader discovery platform, Torpedo, can [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=41.1s)]
*  design both molecular glues and hetero-bifunctional degraders, allowing C4T the capacity to target [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=49.66s)]
*  almost any disease causing protein. C4 is led by President and CEO Andrew Hirsch, who [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  is this week's guest on the podcast. Hi Andrew, thanks for joining us this week. Could you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=65.78s)]
*  give us a bit of background on the history of C4 Therapeutics? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=72.06s)]
*  C4 Therapeutics, we actually go by C4T. This is an interesting little tidbit. There's an [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=77.42s)]
*  energy drink called C4 Energy Drink. And I think there is a little bit of an issue with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  the name and so it's not a legal settlement, but it's an agreement. We have to refer to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  ourselves as C4T in shorthand and not C4 so that we don't get the energy drink confused [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  with the biotech company, which frankly I think is a low risk. But that's sort of why [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  we now refer to ourselves as C4T when we talk externally in press releases, etc. versus [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=104.94s)]
*  just C4. So we were founded back in 2015, spun out of work that was done in Jay Bradner's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=109.66s)]
*  lab at Dana-Farber. And our founders, Nathaniel Gray, Jay Bradner, obviously, Kenny Anderson [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=116.1s)]
*  and Mark Cohen, started the company to really leverage the promise of this new field of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=122.5s)]
*  targeted protein degradation to really change how we treat disease. And so as the company [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=127.58s)]
*  was founded, we did an initial collaboration with Roche almost before we had labs to help [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=133.82s)]
*  get the company started. And we spent the early part of the company's life pursuing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=138.7s)]
*  a target that came out of Dana-Farber, which we actually are no longer pursuing, but also [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=142.58s)]
*  building up what we call our Torpedo platform, which is the way we make our degraders. We [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=146.52s)]
*  went public in October of 2020. And then since then have put three programs into the clinic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=152.54s)]
*  We have a fourth, hopefully, to join soon. And then we have two programs now that we're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=158.94000000000003s)]
*  pursuing in phase one clinical trials, one we just presented data at this past weekend [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  at ESMO in Barcelona. And then we also have four collaborations with large pharma partners, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  which we can talk about. That's with Biogen, with Roche, as I mentioned, with Merck in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=174.46s)]
*  the US and also Merck in Germany. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=178.58s)]
*  Moving on, I wonder if you could give me a bit of an overview of what targeted protein [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  degradation is? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, sure. And I'll start very, very basic. Most diseases that people have are caused [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=188.62s)]
*  by proteins, which are an essential part of how the body works, being dysregulated, doing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=193.66s)]
*  something they're not supposed to do. And the way we've handled them in the past and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  treating disease is we've inhibited them. So we develop a small molecule pill and that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=203.9s)]
*  blocks the activity, but the protein is still, that blocked protein still remains around. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=209.58s)]
*  And targeted protein degradation is a really, really cool approach. And I first learned [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=216.66s)]
*  about it back when I was at Adios and I was CFO and head of corporate development. And [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=219.66s)]
*  one of our scientists, we were working, pursuing some targets. And remember, one of our scientists [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  came to me and said, hey, we need to talk to some of the degrader companies because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=229.26s)]
*  we need a degrader against these targets. And I looked at them, I said, what the hell [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=233.56s)]
*  is a degrader? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  And then that's when I first got excited about the field. And what's really cool about it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  is it turns out that your body actually has a natural recycling system for taking care [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=241.26s)]
*  of either proteins that are made incorrectly or proteins that are no longer needed for [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=246.54s)]
*  their function. It's called the ubiquitin proteasome system. For those of you who are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=250.94s)]
*  kind of in the know in the science, what we do in targeted protein degradation is we develop [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=255.22s)]
*  a small molecule drug pill, can take an orally. And what it does is it effectively tricks [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=260.18s)]
*  that system to destroy the disease causing proteins that we direct it toward. So that's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=265.5s)]
*  that its simplest form. And that has lots of benefits because you're actually removing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=271.18s)]
*  that mutated protein or that bad acting protein as opposed to leaving it around inhibited. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  When you do that, that can cause other things to happen that maybe, you know, you get side [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=282.66s)]
*  effects, et cetera. But we think it's a much, much better approach. And we can actually [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=287.06s)]
*  drive really exquisite selectivity for the mutated protein versus sometimes when you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=291.62s)]
*  inhibit a mutated protein, you're going to inhibit some other things as well, which can [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=296.74s)]
*  lead to toxicity. So it's really a quite powerful tool to be able to treat disease. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=300.58s)]
*  What kind of diseases can targeted protein degradation be used to address? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=306.7s)]
*  It can really be used to address any disease where there's a protein that's sort of causing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=313.02s)]
*  the disease and that by removing that protein, we can stop the disease progression. So it's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=319.78s)]
*  really disease agnostic. It really more depends on the fundamental biology of what's causing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  the disease. Certainly there are diseases caused by loss of function where degradation [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  won't necessarily work. That's where the disease is caused because a protein is not there and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=336.82s)]
*  it should be there. But a lot of diseases are caused by cancer, for example, proteins can [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=341.82s)]
*  get mutated and then those can cause unintended consequences and lead to the cancer growth. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=347.14s)]
*  And so by degrading and destroying those proteins, the goals, we can stop the cancer. And there's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=353.46s)]
*  a number of a lot of other diseases where removing a protein that's not performing as it's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=358.02s)]
*  supposed to and causing the disease can help. So it's really agnostic. We focused our own [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  efforts on oncology. That's really where our pipeline is, although it has broad applicability. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, our collaboration with Biogen is not an oncology, it's in sort of diseases. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=372.46s)]
*  They're focused on neurological and autoimmune diseases. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=377.9s)]
*  Could you maybe go through the different TPD strategies like pro tech and molecular glue, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=381.34s)]
*  lysosome targeting, chimera and antibody based pro tech? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=388.02s)]
*  Yeah. So the field and this is where Flex, this excitement of the potential here has really [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=393.17999999999995s)]
*  exploded, I would say in the last five years. And there's a broader class of therapeutics called [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=398.3s)]
*  proximity induced pharmacology, which are not doing is you're not trying to directly [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=405.26000000000005s)]
*  act on the protein. But what you're trying to do is bring that targeted protein you want destroyed [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=410.06s)]
*  in close proximity and the right relationship with a natural protein to cause that protein to be [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=415.26000000000005s)]
*  degraded. And so I'll talk first about pro techs, which we call our version of pro techs, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=421.9s)]
*  by decks, pro techs, actually, it's a little bit like Kleenex, it's a branded term for our Venus. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=427.5s)]
*  So we call them by decks or more in the sort of generic function way, a hetero by functional [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=433.34s)]
*  degrader. And so what those are is those are sort of two ended molecules. One of the molecules will [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=438.94s)]
*  link into the protein you're trying to destroy. And then the other end of the molecule links into [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=446.3s)]
*  a protein called an E3 ligase. And the E3 ligase is the important component. There's about 600 [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=453.02000000000004s)]
*  different E3 ligases in the body. But that's actually the engine that induces the target [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  protein to be destroyed. And so the whole goal of target to protein degradation is to bring those [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=465.66s)]
*  two together in the way that that E3 ligase recognizes that target protein and says this [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=470.3s)]
*  protein has to be marked for destruction. And so pro tech or hetero by functional degrader or by [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=476.06s)]
*  deck is one way to do that by having a sort of double ended molecule. A molecular glue, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=481.1s)]
*  we call the mono decks, our platform does both. That's a much smaller molecule. And what that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=487.42s)]
*  molecule does, it'll bind to the surface of this E3 ligase protein and change the surface [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  characteristics so that it will attract the target protein. Just a different way to get the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=499.42s)]
*  same outcome. And that's because certain proteins may have smooth surfaces or may not have a good [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=504.7s)]
*  hook to bind on to for a hetero by functional or by deck approach. And so we use a molecular glue [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=511.74s)]
*  or mono deck approach in that setting. Our brand of target to protein degradation, as I mentioned [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=517.9s)]
*  earlier, focuses on a component of a cell called the proteasome, which is pretty simple degradation. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=523.82s)]
*  Lysosomal degradation or, you know, lie tax effectively are hetero by functional molecules. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=529.42s)]
*  But instead of having the protein destroyed by the proteasome, it induces destruction by the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=535.42s)]
*  lysosome. There's a different engine in the body. And those can be used for extracellular proteins [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=540.86s)]
*  where our approach can really be focuses on proteins within a cell. And then the last one [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=547.74s)]
*  you mentioned antibody based pro techs, or we call them degrader antibody conjugates. And this is the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=552.78s)]
*  focus of our collaboration with Merck in the U.S. And it's a really, really powerful tool. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=557.34s)]
*  Antibody drug conjugates have really taken off in the last three or four years. And the idea behind [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=562.86s)]
*  that is you can attach small molecule payloads to an antibody and get really exquisite targeting to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=569.1s)]
*  different cell types that antibody internalizes. And then the payload can deliver a medicine that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=576.0600000000001s)]
*  can destroy the cancer cell, for example, or the disease cell. What's interesting is you can only [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=582.94s)]
*  put a handful of molecules off of an antibody before it loses its structure and targeting [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=589.98s)]
*  integrity. And so the field has really focused on highly toxic chemotherapeutic payloads, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=595.1800000000001s)]
*  which really are kind of broad nuclear bomb type devices that really are highly toxic to the cell. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=601.9000000000001s)]
*  And that's worked, but it's also can lead to some unintended side effects. Inhibitors, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=607.58s)]
*  which we've used, aren't potent enough to use with an antibody in that way because of the limited [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=613.1s)]
*  number of molecules. But because of a specific property of degrader, their catalytic one [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=617.82s)]
*  degrader molecule can degrade thousands of target proteins. They are potent enough to use. And so [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  this approach is basically taking a degrader and attaching it to an antibody, delivering it to a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=630.7800000000001s)]
*  cell through the antibody targeted specificity, but then using the degrader as opposed to a [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=636.86s)]
*  cytotoxic to act on a protein within the cell. And so it's a really exciting approach. It really [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=641.74s)]
*  expands the range of intracellular targets that antibody drug conjugates can go after. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=647.66s)]
*  And those different strategies, are they applicable to different [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=653.82s)]
*  mechanisms or how do those different strategies get applied, I guess? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=657.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it ultimately depends on the disease you're trying to treat, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=661.82s)]
*  the protein you're trying to target and the characteristics of that protein. So for example, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=665.9000000000001s)]
*  there's a protein called GSPT1, which is called a panessential gene. It's effectively in all the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=671.34s)]
*  tissues and compartments, and it's really essential for cell survival. And so it's been an attractive [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=676.7s)]
*  target to go after. But the problem is if you degrade it or you inhibit it, you're going to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=681.9000000000001s)]
*  lead to massive systemic toxicities because, as I said, it's a panessential gene. So one example [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=687.26s)]
*  and one approach could be if we could use that as a payload on an antibody drug conjugate, for example, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=693.98s)]
*  then we can target that payload to the cell specifically you want to destroy the cancer cell, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=699.58s)]
*  let's say. And so you don't have that systemic toxicity, you're targeting that toxicity into [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=705.1s)]
*  the cell. Whereas in a program like our CFT1946, where we use the program we just presented data [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=710.38s)]
*  added ESMO, we're actually going after a very specific protein called BRAF. And BRAF has what's [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=715.98s)]
*  called a V600 mutation that drives a lot of cancers. And that's very specific to the cancers, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=723.26s)]
*  that mutation doesn't happen by definition in healthy cells. And so we don't really need that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=728.78s)]
*  cell targeting because of the specificity of the mutation in the disease. And so we can use [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=734.14s)]
*  an orally bioavailable systemically administered degrader to go after that target. So I think it [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=740.3000000000001s)]
*  really just depends on where the target is, is it in the cells and outside the cell? What's the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=745.82s)]
*  right payload approach? So that's really how we think about, you know, which method to use. We [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=750.22s)]
*  actually don't do Lytax here. Our Torpedo platform is really focused on proteosomal degradation, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=754.46s)]
*  using that UPS based system. And how does TPD or how is it improving on existing methods of treatment? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=760.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I alluded to this earlier, we have really come a long way and inhibitors, right, which is [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=768.7s)]
*  the method that we most commonly use today to limit the function of a mutated or bad acting [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=774.54s)]
*  protein, really have led to some amazing treatment outcomes for patients. But they all suffer from [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=780.06s)]
*  similar liabilities. Most inhibitors, let's say, are reversible, meaning they don't permanently [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=786.62s)]
*  stick to the protein. And so what that means is, you have to flood the system with enough volume [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=791.3399999999999s)]
*  of inhibitors so that they're on and they come off and they're on and they come off, that the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=797.42s)]
*  on rate is enough that inhibits the activity. But that can lead to high doses and then you can have [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=802.62s)]
*  off target toxicities because of that. As I mentioned, one of the things that a degrader does [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=808.38s)]
*  really well is one degrader molecule can actually degrade thousands of target proteins. And so you [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=813.9s)]
*  don't worry as much about kind of off target toxicities. And that leads to a second feature [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=821.02s)]
*  of a degrader is the exquisite selectivity you can get for the target protein. And that's really [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  based on the degrader machinery. What we design our degraders to do is you have to put the target [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=833.1s)]
*  protein in a very specific physical conformation with that E3 ligase protein that I mentioned [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=839.5s)]
*  earlier. And if you don't, you're not going to get efficient degradation. And so that, you know, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=845.58s)]
*  while we engineer our degraders to specifically target the protein of choice, even if we did [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=851.18s)]
*  bind, for example, to a different protein that we didn't want to destroy, it's not optimized to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=856.9399999999999s)]
*  degrade that protein. And so you get exquisite selectivity. And I think that's all it was [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=861.9s)]
*  demonstrated in the data we presented at ESMO this past weekend with our BRAF degrader is that one of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=866.38s)]
*  the limitations of BRAF inhibitors is they have off target toxicities or they can target the natural [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=872.06s)]
*  or we call wild type protein. And that can lead to certain types of skin toxicity. And we didn't [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=878.62s)]
*  see any of that across all five dose ranges that we studied because of that exquisite selectivity [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=883.82s)]
*  of a degrader. And then the other limitation of inhibitors is they're susceptible to mutations [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=889.74s)]
*  in the binding pocket where they bind to block activity. So that pocket can mutate and therefore [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=896.86s)]
*  then the inhibitor doesn't work because it won't block that activity anymore because of the mutations. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=904.38s)]
*  We actually don't care. We're just using sometimes we use that binding pocket, but we just care about [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=911.42s)]
*  it as a hook to bring that target protein and the E3 ligase together. We don't really care about [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=916.22s)]
*  activity. And then we can also bind to other places on the protein that don't have activity, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=922.54s)]
*  but it's a hook. And so we're not susceptible to some of the mutations that inhibitors are [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=927.82s)]
*  susceptible to. And so we think there's lots of advantages that could go on and on, but those are [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=933.58s)]
*  some of the top ones. Could you maybe go into a little bit more detail on your discovery program, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=937.4200000000001s)]
*  Torpedo, and how that works? What it really is, is it's a collection of methods and tools and I would [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=942.46s)]
*  say analytical approaches to make what we think are the most optimized degraders. And the way we [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=949.74s)]
*  do that is the first thing is this idea that I mentioned earlier called catalytic activity. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=956.7s)]
*  The fact that a degrader, once it makes that connection of the E3 ligase and the target [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=961.26s)]
*  protein and that target protein is barked for destruction, it can actually go back and do it [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=966.7s)]
*  again. That's the catalytic cycle. And so we think the best degraders do that the quickest. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=972.3s)]
*  We've seen degraders in the literature that can do 300 to 3000 cycles per minute. We think the ones [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=978.3s)]
*  on the 3000 cycles per minute are the most effective degraders. That's where you get the most [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=985.26s)]
*  efficacy, the best disease approach. And so our Torpedo platform optimizes for catalytic activity. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=990.78s)]
*  And one of the ways we do that is we focused on a specific E3 ligase that's called Cereblon. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=998.86s)]
*  And Cereblon is important for a number of reasons. One, it's really the only clinically validated E3 [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1005.5799999999999s)]
*  ligase. There are three approved medicines that have been on the market for a while. You may have [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1012.22s)]
*  heard of them, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide. Those are degraders and those use [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1016.22s)]
*  Cereblon. And so we know it's validated as a way to approach target protein degradation. And in fact, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1021.26s)]
*  there was a paper coming out of a lab at Harvard that really elucidated what Cereblon's natural [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1027.1000000000001s)]
*  function is, and it is truly a garbage collector. Some of the other E3 ligases, people aren't sure [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1032.7s)]
*  what they do. They can be tissue specific, but the risk there is they may have some important [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1037.9s)]
*  regulatory function in the cell. And so you don't really know if you're going to alter its purpose [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1043.1s)]
*  what that could do. And so we like the fact that Cereblon is there to do exactly what we want it [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1047.74s)]
*  to do, which is clean up proteins that need to be destroyed. And then the other factor is that it's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1052.78s)]
*  expressed in all tissues and compartments in the body. And that means that the ligase will be there [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1058.3799999999999s)]
*  to do degradation on the specific target protein. So those are some key components. One of the things [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1063.1s)]
*  we've actually learned over the course of the 10 years we've been doing this is that really, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1070.14s)]
*  really subtle changes in the way we bind to Cereblon. So remember I talked about those, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1075.98s)]
*  the way we bind to an E3 ligase. So very, very subtle changes in how we bind and how the binder [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1080.7s)]
*  comes off that protein can lead to really big changes in catalytic activity. And so we've made [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1086.7s)]
*  a pretty big investment in what we call our Cereblon toolkit, which is a library of over [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1092.46s)]
*  10,000 molecules at this point all OIP protected that we use in building our highly efficient [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1097.1s)]
*  degraders. Could you tell me a bit about some of the clinical trials that you have running [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1103.1s)]
*  currently? Yes, we have two programs currently underway. I'll start with 1946 since that's the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1108.6999999999998s)]
*  one we just presented this past weekend at ESMO. And that is a study, a phase one study in patients, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1114.62s)]
*  as I mentioned, with V600 mutations. Patients with V600 mutations typically have either melanoma, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1121.26s)]
*  they have colorectal cancer, lung cancer are the three big ones. And then there's a bunch of other [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1128.22s)]
*  types of tumors that can be V600 driven, but aren't quite large, but exist like pancreatic [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1134.54s)]
*  cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, et cetera. And so right now the way those patients are treated [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1139.58s)]
*  is with an inhibitor. And the inhibitor does a really great job of inducing responses. But [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1144.78s)]
*  one of the interesting features of this mutated protein is that the inhibited protein itself [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1151.26s)]
*  can incorporate what's called dimerase with another protein, then continue the aberrant signalling [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1157.82s)]
*  through what's called the MAP-K pathway, which is what leads to cancer. The result of that [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1164.94s)]
*  clinically is that you get resistance. And so while you have an initial response, patients then [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1169.26s)]
*  will ultimately relapse because of this and other similarly mediated resistance mechanisms. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1174.78s)]
*  And so our thinking on a degrader was, well, if we degrade the protein, then that protein's no [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1180.7s)]
*  longer there to what's called paradoxically activate the pathway. And so that's really the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1185.66s)]
*  approach. And we started a phase one study, dose escalation study in all patients that have cancers [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1192.22s)]
*  driven by this V600 mutation. And so we presented data on 36 patients and 27 were efficacy-evaluable, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1198.7s)]
*  36 for safety. And what we showed was that we had really, really exquisite safety. We didn't see, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1206.78s)]
*  as I mentioned, any of the liabilities or toxicities you see with BRAF inhibition. And so it was a very [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1213.26s)]
*  well tolerated drug. We saw a robust degradation of the target. And then we saw very promising [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1219.34s)]
*  signs of anti-tumor activity in the 27 patients that were efficacy-evaluable, including two [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1225.66s)]
*  partial responses, one in a pancreatic cancer patient that had liver metastasis, which are [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1231.26s)]
*  notoriously hard to treat, and then another melanoma patient. So there's different flavors [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1235.82s)]
*  of the V600 mutation. And I believe this is a V600K patient. V600E is the more common one. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  And then we saw a lot of other robust tumor shrinkage not yet reaching the point of partial [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1247.26s)]
*  response by resist criteria. But all of those patients are ongoing and continue to receive [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1253.5s)]
*  therapy and is typically the case in a phase one dose escalation study. The patients at the higher [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1257.82s)]
*  expectedly more efficacious doses are on for the shortest period of time. So very promising early [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1263.4199999999998s)]
*  data that we believe supports proof of mechanism. The degrader did exactly what we wanted it to do. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1268.1399999999999s)]
*  We had beautiful dose proportional PK, oral bioavailability. We degraded the protein. And [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1272.9399999999998s)]
*  starting to see initial early signs of proof of concept that we are doing something different [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1279.5s)]
*  maybe than what an inhibitor is doing, there's a lot more to go. And we have a lot more updates as [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1283.8999999999999s)]
*  we continue to complete the dose escalation as well as other arms of that study. So we're very [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1287.74s)]
*  excited about that. It was the first time we've shared data on that program. The second program, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1293.02s)]
*  and we have data coming in the fourth quarter, is our IKZF1-3 degrader called simcitamide. And [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1298.54s)]
*  this is an already drug targets of degraders I mentioned earlier, thalidomide, lenalidomide, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1304.94s)]
*  and pomalidomide are degraders of those targets. But what's as interesting is when they were [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1309.9s)]
*  approved and developed, we didn't know that they were degraders. And so they're not optimized [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1314.86s)]
*  degraders. But despite that, they have a really, really big impact on the disease course of [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1318.62s)]
*  multiple myeloma for patients and some of the bestselling drugs in cancer. And so we saw an [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1323.34s)]
*  opportunity to, you know, what if we use our platform to create an optimized IKZF1-3 degrader [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1329.02s)]
*  that could maybe lead to better efficacy and more durable responses. And so that's been in the clinic. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1335.1s)]
*  We shared early data in the end of 2023. We were developing it both as a monotherapy in that the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1339.9s)]
*  bulk of the data we shared, as well as in combination with dexamethasone, which is a very [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1347.42s)]
*  traditional combination partner for this class of medicines. And so a very promising responses [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1352.46s)]
*  at a very low dose, 37 and a half micrograms dose daily on a 14 day on 14 day off schedule. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1357.18s)]
*  We've since escalated to through two additional dose levels of 62 and a half micrograms, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1364.3s)]
*  75 micrograms, and also expanded adding additional patients beyond just the safety [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1370.62s)]
*  escalation. And so we expect to share data on about 30 patients in the fourth quarter [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1376.7s)]
*  across all those dose levels in combination with the dexamethasone. In addition, we're also studying [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1381.58s)]
*  this mechanism in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And, you know, from a science perspective, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1387.8999999999999s)]
*  these pathways are important in the treatment of certain non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. But we think that [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1392.62s)]
*  the approved graders of these targets really aren't potent enough to drive meaningful efficacy. And so [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1397.34s)]
*  we did a basket study of multiple subtypes of NHL. And so we'll report that data as well in [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1402.62s)]
*  the fourth quarter. There'll be probably about 20 patients in that cohort. So we haven't shared the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1408.2199999999998s)]
*  venue yet, but we're really excited to now that we were through the first disclosure of our BRAF [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1413.5s)]
*  program to update that data in a more robust manner in the fourth quarter. And then we have [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1418.38s)]
*  a third program that's about to enter the clinic. In fact, the IND was cleared in China just today. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1423.5800000000002s)]
*  This is a really interesting program because EGFR is a very, very important pathway in [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1429.5s)]
*  non-small cell lung cancer. And there's a really, there are really great drugs out there, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1434.14s)]
*  but there's a subtype of EGFR called L858R. And it's the second common driver mutation of lung cancer. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1438.7s)]
*  And with the gold standard EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, those patients actually do less [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1447.02s)]
*  well than other types of driver mutations, one called DEL19. And then any patient who has an [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1452.3s)]
*  inhibitor is subject to some of these mutational resistance issues I talked about. And so what we [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1459.02s)]
*  did is we designed a degrader specific to that L858R mutation. And our degrader binds to a location [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1464.06s)]
*  on the EGFR protein that is only created by that L858R protein. So highly, highly specific. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1472.46s)]
*  And so we're going to start our phase one study actually in China. We partnered with a company [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1479.74s)]
*  called Beta Pharmaceuticals because EGFR is a driven lung cancer. It's a much higher incidence [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1484.3s)]
*  as well as EGFR L858R lung cancer. And so we felt it was more efficient that we could do studies [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1489.74s)]
*  in patients who actually were likely to respond to the drug. And so hopefully that study will [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1496.14s)]
*  start soon and the IND is cleared. And then we'll be able to look at that phase one data. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1501.26s)]
*  And then we maintain China rights and we can start development based on that data set once we sort of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1506.7s)]
*  de-risk the program. So really excited about the clinical pipeline and data can't come fast enough. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1512.94s)]
*  Right. You mentioned the ESMO Congress. How did that go? What was the reaction like to the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1519.1s)]
*  presentation? It went fantastic. I would say investigators were really, really impressed. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1524.46s)]
*  The feedback we've heard from them is that their patients really do well on the drug. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1531.9s)]
*  It's well tolerated and they feel better. And in fact, one of the, we heard from I think it was [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1537.18s)]
*  about patients' family or their physician that they felt like it was a life-changing opportunity [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1542.06s)]
*  for them given the course of their disease. And remember, we're treating patients who have already [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1546.14s)]
*  had a BRAF inhibitor in combination with a MEK inhibitor and have progressed on that. And so [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1550.86s)]
*  it really is an important opportunity. There's a lot of media, I think local media, one of the sites [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1557.1s)]
*  we're doing the studies actually in Barcelona at Valdebron and the team was able to visit it. And so [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1561.6599999999999s)]
*  really, really strong, strong enthusiasm from the investigator community on the initial data set. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1567.1799999999998s)]
*  And I know earlier you mentioned some of the pharma companies that you have partnerships with. I wonder [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1573.34s)]
*  if you could explain some of those. Yes. As I said, Roche was our first collaboration [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1579.74s)]
*  partner that really helped get the company off the ground. And that was initially a six target [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1585.18s)]
*  deal. We have two targets left and it's a simple work. We work with them to develop a degrader [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1589.9s)]
*  against targets of their choice. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to share what those targets are. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1595.5s)]
*  And then they take that program into clinical development and we participate just passively [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1599.58s)]
*  with milestones and royalties downstream. And so there's two targets left on that collaboration. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1604.3s)]
*  And then the Biogen collaboration, I think that was done in 2018 before I joined the company. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1609.42s)]
*  Again, similar structure. I think there were five initial targets that we were working on with them [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1614.46s)]
*  and in their disease areas of interest, which are neurology and autoimmune. And the goal there was [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1618.7s)]
*  to deliver development candidates to them, which they would then take into the clinic. This has [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1623.98s)]
*  been a great year for that collaboration. We've actually delivered two development candidates to [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1628.22s)]
*  them for their pipeline. Again, would love to be able to share the targets and indications, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1632.8600000000001s)]
*  but we're not allowed to. But that's been great for us. We got two $8 million milestones for a [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1638.3s)]
*  total of 16 million for that work. And we're eagerly watching them and can't wait to see that in the [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1642.94s)]
*  clinic. And then the third collaboration we did toward the end of last year in December, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1648.06s)]
*  that's with Mark in the US. And that's this idea of using degraders as payloads for antibody [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1653.02s)]
*  drug conjugates. There's one initial target with an option for three additional targets. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1659.82s)]
*  And so the team's been working really, really well on the first target. And really looking [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1664.38s)]
*  forward to seeing the data there. Again, very similar. They're the lead development and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1670.8600000000001s)]
*  commercialization candidate. And we get milestones and royalties downstream. And then the most recent [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1675.8200000000002s)]
*  collaboration was in Germany, Mark KGAA. And that was a collaboration around two targets that we [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1682.14s)]
*  were working on on our internal pipeline. They're critical oncogenic proteins. But as we looked at [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1687.9s)]
*  the landscape for drug development, we realized that you really need a portfolio approach across [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1693.42s)]
*  the proteins we were working on or targeting. And we felt it would benefit from a large partner, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  large pharma partner. And so that was an area Mark was interested in. And so we were able to partner [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1704.0600000000002s)]
*  those programs. And now we're moving those forward along. We're responsible for the research [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1708.94s)]
*  to the degraders. And then they're going to do clinical development and commercialization. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1713.42s)]
*  So really strong collaboration. And then the last one is the clinical collaboration I mentioned [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1717.5800000000002s)]
*  with better pharmaceuticals to develop the EGFR L8-58R degrader, or we call that CFTE 8919. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1722.7s)]
*  Moving forward, are there any hurdles or challenges in using TPD? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1730.46s)]
*  I think TPD, the field probably suffered early on from some unrealistic expectations. I think, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1735.74s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier, it's a really powerful tool and there's a lot that it can do. But at the end [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1741.26s)]
*  of the day, we're still subject to all the risks and uncertainties of drug development. And I think [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1747.3400000000001s)]
*  that happens. One of the benefits of targeted protein degradation, which is also the risks, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1752.3s)]
*  is that you can target what are previously called undruggable targets because of the way [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1756.54s)]
*  TPD works. If it's not a binding pocket on a protein, you can't inhibit it. It's undruggable. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1762.3s)]
*  But we can do that. And I'll give it a good example. We have had a program targeting a [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1768.3799999999999s)]
*  protein called BRD9, which is an undruggable protein, but it's actually a synthetic lethal [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1771.8999999999999s)]
*  situation in synovial sarcoma and certain other cancers. And so the view is, well, if we degrade [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1777.6599999999999s)]
*  the protein, then those cancer cells will die. And so we developed a really, really fantastic [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1782.6999999999998s)]
*  degrader against that target, beautiful drug-like properties, really robust degradation. But turns [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1788.2199999999998s)]
*  out that BRD9 is also expressed in cardiac tissue. And so because it hadn't been drugged before, no [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1794.4599999999998s)]
*  one knew what the consequence of it was. And what we learned was that it led to some cardiac [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1799.82s)]
*  toxicity in a phase one study. And so we stopped that program. So again, that was a great program. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1803.9s)]
*  It was really well done. We did the exact experiment to understand, but those are some [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1808.8600000000001s)]
*  of the risks that when you start to drug something that's never been drugged before, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1812.94s)]
*  there may be biological consequences that you're not aware of and that even the preclinical models [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1816.46s)]
*  don't suggest. But again, that's a risk of drug development that you always have. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1820.5400000000002s)]
*  I would say the other risk that happened, and this is more for perception than it is reality, is [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1824.5400000000002s)]
*  you've got to be really smart about which targets you go after. That's something I really drive [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1829.18s)]
*  with my team. And I learned that years back when I was at Avala Therapeutics. I always ask the [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1834.14s)]
*  question, what problem are we solving? Or as we call it, what's the degrader rationale? Why do we [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1839.3400000000001s)]
*  need a degrader against this target? And the team has to really articulate that well, because that's [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1844.14s)]
*  crucial to set up your whole experimental plan to understand what's the benefit to patients. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  And so how are we going to answer those questions to prove that degrader rationale? And that sets [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1853.98s)]
*  up your preclinical plan. That sets up your clinical experiment. And you have to understand, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1858.7s)]
*  how is it different? And I think some companies early in the field may have just gone after [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1862.78s)]
*  targets and didn't really think through, well, how is it going to be different than what's already [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1867.82s)]
*  out there? And then that led to people looking at the field saying, well, this doesn't look any [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1873.26s)]
*  different than inhibitors. And reality is that maybe we're never going to show that because [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1877.26s)]
*  there was no reason to do a degrader against that target. So target selection actually becomes [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1881.82s)]
*  crucial. Looking forward, how do you see the field of TPD developing or evolving over the [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1885.5s)]
*  coming years, I guess? In the last five years, I think it's really exploded. The number of small [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1892.22s)]
*  companies that have emerged into the field has blossomed. And I would say almost every large [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1897.66s)]
*  pharma company either has their own internal effort or have some partnership with a company like us [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1902.94s)]

*  much like antibodies were when they were new. It's going to be part of the armamentarium of a [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1914.94s)]
*  company to go after certain proteins or certain targets that are disease causing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1919.98s)]
*  We're at the early days. There's a lot to learn. We've been doing it for 10 years, and I think [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1925.74s)]
*  we've got a lot of experience. I think it's not as easy as people think it is. We've seen companies [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1930.06s)]
*  come to us, both big and small, that have said, hey, we started to make a degrader against this [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1935.34s)]
*  target and we're stuck. Can we collaborate with you to help us? And we don't always do that because [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1940.06s)]
*  it's harder to renovate than it is to build from scratch, I guess. But it's not easy. And we've [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1945.98s)]
*  learned, I would say, through all of our programs, we probably have a database of 400,000 different [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1950.06s)]
*  degrader approaches and degraders we've made and data on those that we can use and leverage to, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1954.94s)]
*  what I think, make the best degraders against any target we want. Is there anything that we didn't [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1961.18s)]
*  cover that you wanted to mention? Yeah, we're excited about what we're doing here. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1965.82s)]
*  TPD is a really exciting field and can lead to real exciting breakthroughs for patient treatment. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1970.54s)]
*  As a leader in the field, we're sort of on the forefront of that and really looking forward to [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1977.58s)]
*  continuing developing our existing clinical programs, as well as we didn't talk about our [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1983.82s)]
*  preclinical pipeline. We're working on a number of targets internally. We're very excited about the [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1989.02s)]
*  clinical programs and the potential to move those forward and what those can do for patients and [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1994.1399999999999s)]
*  then the programs to come that we're working on in our discovery engine. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=1998.62s)]
*  Well, it seems that targeted protein degradation has a bright future. Definitely a case of watch [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBp7W97irlU&t=2006.4599999999998s)]
