# [Rebroadcast] Epigenetic editing – the power of CRISPR without cutting DNA
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA)
*  Hello, while our podcast takes a well-earned brief summer break, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=0.0s)]
*  LaBioTech invites you to enjoy some of our favourite episodes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=14.48s)]
*  We'll return with a brand new episode on August the 16th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=19.28s)]
*  In the meantime, have an awesome summer, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=24.28s)]
*  and we hope you enjoy these favourite episodes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=27.28s)]
*  This week we have a conversation with one of the pioneers of CRISPR about his company, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=31.88s)]
*  which is taking a novel approach to treating disease. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=37.2s)]
*  Stanley Chi was one of the original inventors of CRISPR at UC Berkeley, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=41.44s)]
*  and one of those who published the first paper on CRISPR interference in February 2013. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=47.24s)]
*  That seems almost a lifetime ago in the world of research, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=53.76s)]
*  and now Dr. Chi is the CEO of Epic Bio, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=57.36s)]
*  and that is a company pioneering epigenetic editing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=62.16s)]
*  Before we get to what epigenetic editing is, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=66.44s)]
*  I would normally ask for some background on the company. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=69.2s)]
*  However, this time that's not how the conversation started. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=72.12s)]
*  You've had a very interesting career to this date, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=77.12s)]
*  so I wonder if maybe to start you could tell me a little bit about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=81.04s)]
*  some of the things that you've done so far in the biotech field. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=85.08s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I'm currently an associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=89.52s)]
*  and my primary research direction is to get better technologies and tools [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=95.32s)]
*  that we could use to modify and control the human genome beyond gene editing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=101.0s)]
*  And besides using these tools for research, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=107.92s)]
*  we have a big goal to translate some of these tools into the therapeutic domain, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=111.44s)]
*  such as new gene therapy or cell therapy for disease that really demands a new technology. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=116.76s)]
*  For my training background, I originally got my PhD from UC Berkeley in bioengineering. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  However, even before that, I was trained as a philicist, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=130.8s)]
*  and I have been working on synthetic biology and biofuel production [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=135.04s)]
*  and methods on that for a couple of years before I transitioned my attention fully [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=141.64s)]
*  onto tackling the technologies and the treatments for the human disease. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=146.68s)]
*  And after my PhD at Berkeley, I also worked for a few years at UCSF [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=152.48s)]
*  to as an independent fellow, and there we co-developed technologies [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=157.28s)]
*  like Nucleus DADDECAS9 and CRISPR-i, CRISPR-a. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=162.04s)]
*  And then after I moved my lab to Stanford, we've been very much focused on thinking [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=167.56s)]
*  how we could use these technologies to treat disease. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  And we have a particular focus on the human epigenome, such as the epigenetic editing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=178.16s)]
*  Is that what led to the formation of EPIC Bio? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=184.72s)]
*  Oh, yes. So we've been working in this domain for more than a decade, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=188.76s)]
*  and it all started with the need, the huge need that the question is, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=194.68s)]
*  how can we precisely modify or control the human genome? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=200.68s)]
*  And CRISPR technology came out, right, got inspired. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=206.32s)]
*  It was originally discovered as a bacteria's genetic immune system [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=210.96s)]
*  used by bacteria cells to fight their viruses, like bacteriophages. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=215.0s)]
*  It has super high potential for precision. That really excited me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=220.32s)]
*  So we've been working on polishing the tools in the lab, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=226.28s)]
*  and many of our papers being published on top journals. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=230.52s)]
*  But meanwhile, the technology is being filed as patents. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=234.84s)]
*  And then as we shifting more and more focus onto the translational side, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=238.76s)]
*  I realized there is a huge need to translate these tools outside of the lab. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=243.08s)]
*  And while the research lab itself is not sufficient to provide a full spectrum [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  for testing them in humans and also develop them as a real product to the real world. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  And therefore, we've been talking to the people and the investors and the supporters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=262.56s)]
*  There is a big support to say, OK, so let's try to license out the technology into a new startup, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=269.8s)]
*  which is Epic Bio, which was founded in 2019 and supported by Horizon Ventures. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, also Horizon Ventures and the McCushing Foundation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=282.8s)]
*  being a long term supporter to my research in the lab. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=286.88s)]
*  So they're very well familiar with everything going on on the technology advancement side. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=289.96s)]
*  And I get a huge amount of support from them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=295.32s)]
*  And I should also mention, in the meantime, we almost every other week, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=299.2s)]
*  we got an email from a stranger, a patient, either it's them, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=303.28s)]
*  is there like children, their parents or their friends? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  They got a rare disease. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=310.12s)]
*  They read news about our technology and they ask, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=311.8s)]
*  oh, when your technology could be accessed by patients? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=316.12s)]
*  We did feel there is a demand for doing this timely to benefit the society. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=319.12s)]
*  CRISPR has obviously been around for a while now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=325.6s)]
*  Could you tell me about some of the things like CRISPR interference [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  in the epigenome and epigenetic editing? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=334.16s)]
*  Could you explain what those all are? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=337.44s)]
*  Yeah, like you said, CRISPR feels both old and new to people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=339.72s)]
*  First, I should say why it feels old, because the technology was reported a decade ago. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=345.32000000000005s)]
*  And a decade seems a long time in the tech world, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=352.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, it feels new because the first CRISPR drug was approved a month ago. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  And just yesterday, I saw the news that it expanded the disease scope from the first drug, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=361.88s)]
*  further from secancellinemia to beta-settlcemia, which is very exciting. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=369.52s)]
*  But if you consider how this drug been going from testing in the cell cultures in the lab [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  to being approved as a drug in patients, it took like less than 12 years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=381.56s)]
*  I think that's extremely fast for a drug development perspective. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=387.48s)]
*  But meanwhile, we've been working on this very different spectrum of the CRISPR, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=392.36s)]
*  which is we do not focus on gene editing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=397.12s)]
*  CRISPR came out from as a nucleus molecule and is an already guided DNA cutting molecule. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=400.8s)]
*  We call it a nucleus. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=407.8s)]
*  It allows us to cut the DNA and modify the sequence on that particular site of the DNA. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  And however, since day one, our inspiration from this CRISPR is less about this cutting ability. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=417.76s)]
*  If I make a metaphor, I would say, OK, CRISPR is a very precise scissors that allow us to do [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=425.32s)]
*  gene surgery on the genome. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=433.04s)]
*  We are less inspired by the scissor function. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  We are more inspired by precision function. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=438.56s)]
*  And based on this, we thought, OK, how can we harness this precision? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=441.04s)]
*  Because it allows us to use a RA to target any piece of DNA and then to control the function [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=445.92s)]
*  come out from the piece of DNA. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=452.24s)]
*  That really leads to two inventions. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  One is this nucleus DADCAS. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=456.56s)]
*  We name it DCAS. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=458.8s)]
*  D stands for DAD. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=460.4s)]
*  So DCAS9, DCAS12, DCASmini, like miniature CAS that we developed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=461.72s)]
*  And also, second technology is leading to this control technology, which is we named [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=467.04s)]
*  CRISPRi, CRISPR-inferior for silencing a gene, or CRISPRa for activating a gene. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=472.36s)]
*  And that being said, this leads to expanding the gene editing from altering the sequence [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=478.68s)]
*  into modifying the human epigenetics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=485.72s)]
*  OK, your question is, what is the human epigenome? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=489.16s)]
*  The epigenome is the chemistry of the DNA that controls gene expression. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=492.76000000000005s)]
*  By chemistry, it could be broadly defined. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  But I can give you one most well-started example is gene methylation. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=501.56s)]
*  For example, there are a lot of studies showing that if a gene region, consider human genome, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=506.04s)]
*  is modified heavily by gene methylation, that really leads to silencing of that gene, sometimes [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=513.24s)]
*  even permanent silencing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  When the cells divide, these methylation marks are also inherited by daughter cells. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=521.0s)]
*  So those keep silencing the genes in the daughter cells. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=525.56s)]
*  But if a piece of a gene is depleted, all the methylation is usually associated with [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=528.36s)]
*  gene activation, gene on. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=534.0s)]
*  So it's really like this chemistry is fascinating because Z controls the fate of the DNA, how [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=536.04s)]
*  the DNA is expressed, when they are expressed, and when something goes wrong there with the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=542.28s)]
*  chemistry, it definitely leads to disease. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=547.24s)]
*  That really leads to what we want. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=549.52s)]
*  Let's make tools for modifying epigenomes, which are called epigenetic editing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=552.0s)]
*  And we want to be very safely and very precisely to modify such chemistry marks, such as installing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=557.52s)]
*  new methylation marks to silencing the gene permanently or we erase the marks to turn [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=563.72s)]
*  on the gene permanently. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=569.88s)]
*  And I believe all this would find their potential uses for disease treatment. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=571.16s)]
*  Could you tell me a bit about your GEMS or gene expression modulation system? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=577.04s)]
*  Yes, and the core component of our technology is so we can precisely modify the human [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=583.24s)]
*  genetics relies on two components. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=590.76s)]
*  One component is a precision molecule. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=593.64s)]
*  We invented a miniature cath system, which is only a third size of cath 9 and which makes [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  it much easier to deliver into the cells or into the body. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=604.12s)]
*  And the second component, which is a piece of protein, which is actually an enzyme that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=608.28s)]
*  either comes from the natural human of human proteins or is being engineered to further [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=615.12s)]
*  improve the activity. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=621.16s)]
*  What does this enzyme do? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  This enzyme will modify the chemistry on the DNA or histones associated with DNA. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=624.28s)]
*  So we can influence how the genes are turned on or turned off. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=630.6s)]
*  And normally we call it gene expression modulation because despite it being an epigenetic [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=635.84s)]
*  enzyme, such as being modifying the methylation marks of certain units of the histone or it's [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=641.96s)]
*  being a methyltransferase or demethylase, we think the outcome is to modify gene expression. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=649.08s)]
*  We can turn on or switch off gene expression. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  Therefore, we name it gene expression modulation or GEMS. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=657.52s)]
*  One of the good things about this system is that the editing is reversible. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=660.72s)]
*  How do you reverse that and why would you need to do that? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=665.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fantastic question. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=669.12s)]
*  So I've been thinking about this question for a long time, even since the beginning of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=672.08s)]
*  the technology. So if we think about the gene editing, we talk about modifying the sequence, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=677.16s)]
*  such as by converting a single base pair A to a G example, or disrupting a gene by [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=682.76s)]
*  deleting a fragment from this gene. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=689.48s)]
*  And all these modifications are considered irreversible. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=691.88s)]
*  It's not saying that it's absolutely impossible to reverse that, but in the normal clinical [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=696.52s)]
*  setup, it's irreversible. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=702.6s)]
*  Being irreversible brings the good thing about it could be a one time treatment, but it [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=704.6s)]
*  also bears a big risk, which is if these irreversible modifications occur outside of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=711.04s)]
*  your general interest on another side, which we call it off target, if such a thing [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=717.36s)]
*  happens, it will be very hard to remedy that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=722.84s)]
*  And in comparison to these permanent DNA sequence modification changes, we are very excited [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=726.76s)]
*  about epigenetics because epigenetics by intrinsic design, either from nature or from [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  our technology, is reversible. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=739.52s)]
*  Because think about the chemistry on the DNA. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  It's all being introduced and erased. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=744.96s)]
*  For every single modification, like a denomization, there is a writer. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=748.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, there is an eraser. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=752.6s)]
*  And it's kind of like a whiteboard, right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=755.0s)]
*  So you can write something there, but you can also erase that when you don't need it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=756.88s)]
*  That really brings up a safety and also the flexibility, because sometimes if we like, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  at this moment, we need to turn on these genes, but later we need to turn them off because [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=768.04s)]
*  we no longer need these modifications. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=773.56s)]
*  I think the very exciting potential here is, yes, we can do it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=775.56s)]
*  We've seen what CRISPR can do in terms of how it treats diseases. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=780.5999999999999s)]
*  What are the implications of your system in terms of how will it advance treatments? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=785.64s)]
*  Yes, I have this recognition that epigenetic editing is the next pillar of the gene editing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=792.32s)]
*  and gene therapy. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=800.32s)]
*  And what excites me most is it expands the scope of the gene editing to treat more [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=801.96s)]
*  diseases that beyond simply editing the DNA sequence. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  And why do I say that? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=812.08s)]
*  And considering the current disease that's being very actively tackled in the domain of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=813.96s)]
*  gene editing, they mostly belong to single mutation disease. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  For example, the first CRISPR drug addresses sickle cell anemia, beta cellysemia, and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=823.48s)]
*  there are also CRISPR companies working on liver disease. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=830.04s)]
*  And many of these diseases are caused by a single mutation in a single gene. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=834.16s)]
*  And while this is already super exciting because many of these diseases do not yet have [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  treatment and also gene editing brings in a cure, not just a treatment. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=844.48s)]
*  And we do recognize the disease scope that could be tackled by gene editing is relatively [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=849.0s)]
*  limited at the moment. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=855.36s)]
*  And I feel it's a pity that we have such wonderful technology and tools, but we can only [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=857.0s)]
*  address a small category of disease. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=862.28s)]
*  And by the way, many of these diseases are rare diseases. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=864.72s)]
*  And but when we look at the broader disease category, we realized more than 40 percent of [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=867.48s)]
*  the disease are related to human DNA changes, either genetic or epigenetic. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=873.0799999999999s)]
*  And actually, I should say this number keeps increasing because the more people started [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=877.96s)]
*  into the mechanism of the root of the disease, they realized, oh, more could be addressed [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=883.2800000000001s)]
*  definitely by genetics or epigenetics. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=888.2800000000001s)]
*  So 40 percent is an underestimation. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=890.2s)]
*  And the furthermore, and even in the realm of the rare of the genetic disease, there are [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=893.0s)]
*  like more than 8000 of them. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=897.6s)]
*  And many of them are regarded as orphaned disease because they only affect a small [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=899.76s)]
*  population. But you time that number by a thousand is actually affects six percent of [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=904.96s)]
*  the global population, which is a significant category of disease. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=910.88s)]
*  And while gene editing can only address a smaller population of patients, we ask questions, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=914.4s)]
*  can we use epigenetic editing technologies to dramatically broaden it? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  I can give you some examples. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=925.88s)]
*  Gene editing, the concept of that is if there is a mutation, we can target to the region [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=929.6s)]
*  that bearing the mutation and precisely either disrupt the mutation or correct the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  mutation. However, that really leads to some challenges for certain disease. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=940.9200000000001s)]
*  For example, cystic fibrosis is a disease that caught by one gene. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=945.36s)]
*  But there are more than 2000 possible mutations spread across the gene. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=951.2800000000001s)]
*  And while there are some dominant mutations in the patient population, but so many [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=955.96s)]
*  mutations in that disease only have a few hundred patients in the world with that [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=961.12s)]
*  mutation. That's a broad question. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=966.08s)]
*  Like, are we going to develop a different modality just to treat a hundred people? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=967.96s)]
*  And how can we design the clinical trial for that? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=974.28s)]
*  Right. And is this even commercially feasible? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  And when we think about that, we think, OK, if we can use epigenetic editing, we can [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=979.96s)]
*  make it mutation agnostic. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=984.72s)]
*  Seeing, sure, there are a few hundred patients for each mutation, but there are 2000 [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=987.28s)]
*  mutations, but it's caused by one single gene. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=991.48s)]
*  It's a one gene disease. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  What about we use epigenetic editing to either reactivating the gene function or [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  silencing the gene function? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1001.96s)]
*  Then we don't need to develop so many different modalities for individual mutations. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1003.6s)]
*  We can design one modality targeting to a region that is common to all the people and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1009.64s)]
*  let our enzyme, the epigenetic enzyme, introduce the chemistry, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1015.8s)]
*  Methylation or demethylation marks into the chromatin and then we can treat the disease. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1022.0799999999999s)]
*  That is the reason that we definitely think the epigenetic editing bear huge benefits [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1028.08s)]
*  to expand the scope of treatment. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1033.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm just giving you one example. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1035.96s)]
*  By the way, there are actually many categories of disease caused by, for example, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  repeat expansion, which means a sequence being repeated multiple times in the genome, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1042.4s)]
*  which leads to a problem that is very hard to be addressed by gene editing, but could [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  be great targets for epigenetic editing. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1052.48s)]
*  And another big category is haploinsefficiency disease. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1054.8400000000001s)]
*  And haploinsefficiency means half. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1058.3200000000002s)]
*  So basically means in our body, there is a gene cause problem, but half of the allele [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1060.72s)]
*  of the gene, which is one copy of allele is good, but another copy is bad, is diseased. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1066.48s)]
*  So we can use epigenetic editing to reactivate the good allele to restore the good dosage, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1071.2s)]
*  like Rett syndrome and a bunch of like obesity related disease are caused by this type of [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1076.44s)]
*  root of the disease. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1082.64s)]
*  So I'm just giving you a very small category of the disease that we believe we can [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1084.04s)]
*  expand to, but there are many more we really like suitable for epigenetic editing. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1089.72s)]
*  This seems like there's so many different things that you can do here. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1094.56s)]
*  Is it overwhelming? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1098.4s)]
*  I know that you're going to focus on an FSHD, but in the bigger picture, how will you try [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1099.76s)]
*  and tackle all of these conditions? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1105.76s)]
*  This is great. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1109.8s)]
*  Great question. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1110.64s)]
*  We always keep ourselves busy. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1111.24s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's 24-7 working, but we always working. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1112.8s)]
*  But meanwhile, like you said, there are so many potentials. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1116.44s)]
*  There are so many challenges as well. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1119.6s)]
*  Each disease could be very hard, right? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1121.84s)]
*  Because there are specificities to each disease. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1124.56s)]
*  Our strategy is to first approve that our technology could be safe in humans. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1127.24s)]
*  It's pretty much like for gene editing, right? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1133.08s)]
*  So it also has huge potential to many types of disease. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1135.56s)]
*  And people start with some disease that has a demand, medical need, but also feasible [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1139.08s)]
*  and also have a clear clinical path to demonstrate its efficacy and safety in humans. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1145.16s)]
*  And we are doing the same thing here for epigenetic editing. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  So that's why we focus a lot of efforts on FSHD. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1154.5200000000002s)]
*  We have two goals, one here. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1160.0400000000002s)]
*  And one is to really find a treatment to FSHD because there is a big medical need. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1161.48s)]
*  Second is to demonstrate the epigenome editing is safe and has efficacy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1166.5600000000002s)]
*  And okay, so another reason is, okay, why do you choose FSHD? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1175.88s)]
*  So FSHD is a common form of muscular dystrophy. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1176.1200000000001s)]
*  It's actually the second largest muscular dystrophy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1180.16s)]
*  It's actually a genetic condition characterized by progressive chronic muscle [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1183.0s)]
*  weakness and atrophy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1187.8000000000002s)]
*  And specifically, FSHD stands for facial scapular humeral muscular dystrophy. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1189.64s)]
*  It affects face, shoulders, and upper arms. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1195.96s)]
*  But unlike Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it varies greatly in severity. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1199.0400000000002s)]
*  And also many people experiencing ranging from mild to severe symptoms. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1204.92s)]
*  And making is people regard as the most sophisticated physical disease. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1209.8s)]
*  But then there are some complexities that which we believe is perfect for [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1215.28s)]
*  epigenome editing because it's caused by an inappropriate expression of a gene [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1219.6399999999999s)]
*  called Dux4 in muscle cells. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1225.04s)]
*  And it furthermore is related to the copy duplication of this Dux4. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1227.2s)]
*  And normally this gene is silenced in many tissues, including muscles. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1232.44s)]
*  However, in individuals with FSHD, there are some genetic changes or epigenetic [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1237.4s)]
*  changes, there are different types of FSHD really leads to a variant expression of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1242.64s)]
*  Dux4, which gradually weakens the muscle cell leading to cell death. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1246.8s)]
*  It's traditionally hard for gene editing to tackle this disease because it's [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1251.44s)]
*  related to many copies of the Dux4 in the genome. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1255.8s)]
*  And it's very hard to damage the genome at so many sites and fix the problem there. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1258.72s)]
*  But using epigenome editing, we can re-silence the disease causing genes [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1263.36s)]
*  and regardless of their copy numbers. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1268.6399999999999s)]
*  And also we can use the advances from already come from the Duchenne muscular [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1271.76s)]
*  dystrophy like a viral vector to address this disease. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1277.2s)]
*  That's that therefore we believe we have all the necessary molecular modalities [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1280.0s)]
*  prepared us to try it in animals and in patients. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1285.76s)]
*  And we choose this as our beginning point. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1289.96s)]
*  And we, after we verify the safety, we are expanding them to other disease. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1292.28s)]
*  And how will your platform tackle the disease? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1297.96s)]
*  The epi321? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1301.12s)]
*  Yeah, epi321 is a codename for our current epigenetic drug to treat this. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1303.32s)]
*  What is that? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1308.8s)]
*  It's a molecule. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1309.48s)]
*  It encodes a molecule, which is like I described, it's a fusion molecule between [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1310.68s)]
*  a miniature cathmolic system fused with a epigenetic enzyme, which allow us to [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1315.36s)]
*  silence the DOX4 gene by installing the methylation into the chromatin. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1321.92s)]
*  It's supposed to be a one-time treatment and the permanent cure of the disease. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1327.08s)]
*  And what's in it is we use a viral vector, a dental associated virus, a way to encode [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1331.6s)]
*  a gene that encodes this fusion protein. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1338.36s)]
*  And we also co-express a guide RNA that specifically directs this molecule onto [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1341.16s)]
*  the site of DOX4 gene. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1346.72s)]
*  And so we can make this very precise. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1348.8000000000002s)]
*  And that is the form of what epi321. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1351.8000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, this vector, the AEV system has been for delivery, has been wildly [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1355.5600000000002s)]
*  validated models like primates and used for other muscular disease. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1362.2s)]
*  Therefore, we believe we are at a very interesting prime moment to combine the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1367.0s)]
*  existing technologies with our new epigenome editing technology to tackle this disease. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1373.0s)]
*  Could you tell me a little bit about the plans for the clinical trial? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1379.56s)]
*  So we got the clinical trial. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1383.9199999999998s)]
*  We are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy and also optimize dosing [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1385.52s)]
*  of our therapeutic approach. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1391.28s)]
*  So our hope is to initiate the fifth clinical trial with those focus and goals [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1393.16s)]
*  bear in mind because it's a new type of epigenome editing. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1399.3600000000001s)]
*  So we need to, there are a few things that we need to do. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1403.76s)]
*  One is to verify this mode of action, which is a relatively new mode of action. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1406.0800000000002s)]
*  But meanwhile, since the gene therapy being rapidly progressing, like CRISPR being [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1411.44s)]
*  used as a drug for genetic disease mutation, correct mutation, right, gene disruption. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1416.16s)]
*  And we all use similar technologies that invented there, but also blend in with new [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1422.04s)]
*  methods to particularly focus on epigenetics, such as sequencing methods to [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1427.84s)]
*  sequence the off targets and verify the off target modifications and the easy [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1432.32s)]
*  experience to verify the mode of action. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1438.36s)]
*  And meanwhile, and we will focus on the administration because the method of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1440.6799999999998s)]
*  administering the treatment is very important for this FSHD. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1446.52s)]
*  We need to optimize that as a gene therapy. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1451.24s)]
*  We will optimize like intra muscular injections of our viral vector. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1454.6s)]
*  And then we will investigate what is the dose required and how to get the best [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1459.84s)]
*  method of these gene editing, epigenome editing, a molecule into the cells as [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1465.1200000000001s)]
*  much as possible. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1470.32s)]
*  There are a lot of treatments that cost an awful lot of money. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1471.6s)]
*  Is this something that you will be able to do at a reasonable cost? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1475.08s)]
*  In terms of the R&D research, that's why we work diligently with investors and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1479.44s)]
*  also other biotech and the pharma companies to investigate this disease. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1487.04s)]
*  That's already been demanding a big amount of capital to support the whole [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1491.64s)]
*  process of this clinical trial. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1496.6000000000001s)]
*  And we've been recognized by many supporters, so I'll be confident about that. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1498.96s)]
*  And meanwhile, if you talk about the cost after this drug being developed, I do [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1504.24s)]
*  expect, like many gene therapies, the cost could be high at the beginning because [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1509.48s)]
*  there is a smaller group of patients suitable for this disease and also all the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1514.6s)]
*  manufacturer and other costs coming into it is high. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1518.92s)]
*  But just kind of like any other technology, many technologies, right, it's [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1523.56s)]
*  usually started as a luxury product. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1528.2s)]
*  And gradually, because of the cost of the base goes up because we can treat more [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1531.04s)]
*  patients in this case and the manufacturer cost goes down, the scale up goes up. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1535.8799999999999s)]
*  So we can start greatly reduce the cost. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1541.08s)]
*  I believe the next few decades of medicine will be dramatically different and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1544.28s)]
*  people will no longer feel it's strange to talk about gene therapy. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1549.24s)]
*  And there is no reason for gene therapy to be as expensive as today. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1554.2s)]
*  I actually believe there will be orders magnitude lower cost in the [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1558.8400000000001s)]
*  future for these medicines. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1562.48s)]
*  That's excellent. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1564.68s)]
*  Is this an area that there's just your company working on or are there other [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1565.8400000000001s)]
*  companies working in this field? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1570.0400000000002s)]
*  So there are a few other companies also working on this precision epigenetic [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1572.5200000000002s)]
*  editing, but if you look at broadly on the epigenetics companies, even before [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1578.0400000000002s)]
*  the age of CRISPR, there were companies working on epigenetic to treat cancer. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1584.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1589.24s)]
*  So like these days, as you're also people working on epigenetics to engineer [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1589.72s)]
*  stem cells as cell therapy, or to do anti-aging, they're very active research [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1594.44s)]
*  on that and those epigenetics research companies also being like in the world. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1600.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1607.2s)]
*  So they are doing their great job. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1607.44s)]
*  And for us, we focus on precise epigenome editing. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1609.0800000000002s)]
*  And besides Epic Bios, there are other companies like Chroma, Tune, and they [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1613.0s)]
*  also developing technologies and addressing disease, and because there are [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1618.64s)]
*  many disease really in this field, I'm super excited to see more than one [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1623.96s)]
*  company working on this, right? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  Because really speaking from both technology side and also speaking from [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1631.5600000000002s)]
*  the disease indication side, I'm happy to see the technology is being [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1636.32s)]
*  developed by multiple parties and optimized differently for different [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1641.16s)]
*  disease, and the hope is to bring these biotechnology advances onto the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1645.36s)]
*  heads of patients as soon as possible. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1649.8799999999999s)]
*  What else do you have in your pipeline that you're working on? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1652.36s)]
*  Yeah, besides FSHD, which is a muscular dystrophy disease, we also have [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1656.32s)]
*  pipelines about liver disease and including both genetic disease, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1661.2s)]
*  of the genetic liver disease, and also infectious type of liver disease. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1666.48s)]
*  And we also have a pipeline regarding the retina disease, which also very [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1670.64s)]
*  amenable for the AV type delivery. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1675.0400000000002s)]
*  By the way, for liver disease, we do use an MRA therapy. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1678.0s)]
*  We use MRA to encode our epigenome editing molecule and we package that in [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1682.52s)]
*  lipid nanoparticles like LMP, which has been used as vaccines and many other [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1687.84s)]
*  drug development, and we are very excited about that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1693.0s)]
*  And beyond these categories, I'm personally very excited about neurological [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  disease. And neurological disease, there are so many of them and most of them [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1700.52s)]
*  have no cure at all. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1705.1999999999998s)]
*  And but there is a big demand and it's been traditionally challenging because of [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1706.7199999999998s)]
*  the lack of the effective genetic molecule to modify the genetics in the neurons [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1711.1599999999999s)]
*  and also because of lack of delivery methods to particularly deliver into the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1715.8s)]
*  brain or into the spine. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1720.04s)]
*  And but I believe we are starting at the moment to use the epigenome editing to [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1721.76s)]
*  modify the neurons, such as treating Rett syndrome, Injuman syndrome and other [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1727.3999999999999s)]
*  type of genetic disease like even autoimmune like multiple sclerosis. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1733.76s)]
*  And another reason I really like from biological side, I'm very interested in [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1738.24s)]
*  neurological disease is these are the type of cells that neurons like super [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1743.28s)]
*  important and also do not divide at all and live with us forever. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1748.32s)]
*  If we lose them, we lose them. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1753.28s)]
*  That really like match to the concept of epigenetics, which is you talk about not [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1755.04s)]
*  a cell divide and you talk about how to reinstall some chemistry into a existing [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1760.96s)]
*  cell to regulate their expression so we can reverse disease. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1767.92s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm excited about all these disease, but also I hope there would be more [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1771.96s)]
*  options for us to modify the epigenetic in these diseases. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1777.0s)]
*  So where does the company go from here? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1780.52s)]
*  I know you've been extremely busy lately. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1782.8s)]
*  So what are the next steps? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1784.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1786.6000000000001s)]
*  Number one priority is for us to bring our first epigenetic editing drug into the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1787.2s)]
*  clinics and prove it safe and prove it's efficient. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1793.76s)]
*  We are working very diligently on this major task. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1797.32s)]
*  And meanwhile, we also continuously innovating our epigenetic platform. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1800.0400000000002s)]
*  Epic Bio is both a platform technology company and also a gene therapy company. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1805.5600000000002s)]
*  And we aim to address the most challenging disease that not addressed by gene editing. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1811.8000000000002s)]
*  But meanwhile, we are providing a broad technology based on epigenetic editing. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1817.5200000000002s)]
*  And for example, we have a pipeline for protein engineering and screening. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1823.7600000000002s)]
*  And we also have much like artificial intelligence discovery pipeline in the [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1828.3600000000001s)]
*  company to discover and engineer and optimize all these epigenome editing molecules. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1833.16s)]
*  And these technologies are broadly useful even beyond the gene therapy field. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1840.8400000000001s)]
*  For example, cancer treatment and like CAR T and T cell therapy has been successful [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1846.64s)]
*  right in treating some type of tumors like a blood tumors. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1852.96s)]
*  But meanwhile, there is a big need to expand beyond blood tumor. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  And we do believe epigenome editing in T cells, in other type of immune cells, like [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1859.4s)]
*  macrophage and natural killer cells will be key to optimize their efficacy to all [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1864.48s)]
*  different types of cancer and beyond cancer, like stem cell therapy, regarding how [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1870.6000000000001s)]
*  you can engineer the epigenetics of the stem cell to make them differentiate into [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1875.4s)]
*  most therapeutic relevant cells and or like more common disease, like a joint [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1880.6000000000001s)]
*  disease, a heart disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1885.4s)]
*  All of them will require the advantage from epigenome editing. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1890.44s)]
*  We are actually working with different industry partners to open our platform and [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1893.8400000000001s)]
*  use them for different disease categories. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1899.24s)]
*  And even in the longer future, people talk about, oh, how can we help? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1901.8400000000001s)]
*  Because a lot of disease are age related. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1906.0s)]
*  How can we address this age related disease? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1907.64s)]
*  And we do believe many age related disease are relevant to epigenetics because in [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1909.88s)]
*  many of those disease, you do not obviously see mutation of DNA, but you see [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1914.68s)]
*  changes in epigenetics. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1918.5600000000002s)]
*  And we are also interested in potentially in those categories. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1920.0s)]
*  It keep us very busy. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1923.76s)]
*  There are a lot of opportunities, a lot of potentials, but we also recognize the [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1924.88s)]
*  number one priority is to bring this to treat at least one disease. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1928.72s)]
*  Not only fascinating science, but also a very promising way to treat certain [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1935.64s)]
*  diseases. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1941.0s)]
*  I think with so many advancements in science and the influence of AI, the next [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1942.04s)]
*  few years promise to be very interesting. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H69TklaqsAA&t=1947.28s)]
