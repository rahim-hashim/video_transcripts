Video Description: Antibody-drug conjugates have been an area of great interest in the oncology space in recent years, with a record rate of FDA approvals and dealmaking activity. However balancing efficacy and off-site toxicity has remained a challenge.


Some biopharma companies are investing in what they hope will be the next-generation approach to ADCs – bispecific ADCs. 


More than a dozen early-stage clinical trials are evaluating whether adding a second targeting functionality can improve the preciseness of ADCs’ tumor-targeting, as well as potentially overcome the challenge of heterogeneity in solid tumor target expression. 


Bispecific ADCs have been a hot area for dealmaking over the past year, including BMS’ $8.4 billion purchase of a bispecific ADC candidate in December, a $690 million deal between Biotheus and Hansoh this spring, and the recently announced $325 million deal between Prague-based SOTIO Biotech and Biocytogen.


SOTIO’s most advanced ADC, SOT102, is now in a phase 1/2 clinical study in the U.S. and Europe. 


To talk about biotechs in Czechia, and bispecific ADCs, our conversation this week is with Radek Špíšek, CEO of SOTIO.


01:22-03:17: About SOTIO
03:17-06:12: Are there many biotech or biopharma companies in Prague? 
06:12-08:16: Are there any challenges or opportunities being in Prague?
08:16-13:21: What are bispecific ADCs and how do they differ from regular ADCs?
13:21-15:37: Are there any challenges using bispecific ADCs?
15:37-17:07: What are the benefits of bispecific ADCs?
17:07-18:40: Do bispecific ADCs address the challenge of balancing efficacy and off-site toxicity?
18:40-19:42: Why are bispecific ADCs such a hot topic?
19:42-21:35: Deals involving bispecific ADCs, and SOTIO’s partnership with Biocytogen
21:35-24:15: What is SOT102?
24:15-26:41: What else is in SOTIO’s pipeline?
26:41-27:47: What is the future for bispecific ADCs? 
27:47-29:01: What does this mean for patients?

# Bispecific ADCs: the next generation of cancer treatments
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 114. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=16.32s)]
*  We have kind of two subjects this week, bispecific antibody drug conjugates or ADCs, and the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=21.36s)]
*  country of Czechia, also known as the Czech Republic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=29.38s)]
*  ADCs have been of great interest in the oncology space in recent years, with a record rate [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=33.339999999999996s)]
*  of FDA approvals. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=41.06s)]
*  Having said that, balancing efficacy and toxicity is still a challenge. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=43.22s)]
*  Some biopharma companies are investing in what they hope will be the next generation [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  approach, and that's by specific ADCs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  One company that is tackling bispecific ADCs is SotiobioTech. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=58.6s)]
*  It's based in Prague, the capital of Czechia, and so to talk about bispecific ADCs and biotechs [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=65.36s)]
*  in Czechia, our guest this week is Radek Špišek, CEO of SotiobioTech. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  The first question then is if you could tell me a bit about the company. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=83.48s)]
*  Yeah, SotiobioTech is, I guess, one of the rare biotech companies in the region, meaning [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=87.84s)]
*  center Eastern Europe. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=94.16s)]
*  We were founded some 14 years ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=96.16s)]
*  That was a great coincidence. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  I think that at the time I was coming back from my post-doctoral studies from the US [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=100.92s)]
*  when I was working in the domain of cancer immunology, cancer immunotherapy, and at that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=106.12s)]
*  time a Czech billionaire, a guy called Peter Kellner, who owns a large financial institution, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=111.8s)]
*  had the idea that he would basically like to invest part of his activities also in the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=121.56s)]
*  biotech domain. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  So in 2010, SotiobioTech started with a very ambitious idea, which we still believe is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  different from the concept of like classical biotech companies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=133.2s)]
*  You usually see the idea was that PPF, which is the name of the company, would start funding [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=137.56s)]
*  an entity and the ambition of the entity from the very beginning was to create sort of a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=143.88s)]
*  mid-size biotech with a pipeline of, let's say, up to 10 programs all in oncology at [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=149.8s)]
*  different stages of development, focused on different entities. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=156.92s)]
*  And the ambition, because of the funding we were able to get, the ambition has always [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=161.12s)]
*  been that SotiobioTech would try to incubate those programs all the way from the preclinical [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=165.44s)]
*  stage through the translation to the Phase 1 program, and if the data are supportive, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=171.04s)]
*  then even further. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=177.36s)]
*  And the ambition, which is still true, is that it would be great if one day we would [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=178.8s)]
*  be lucky and we would bring one of those programs all the way to the market, which would then [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=184.08s)]
*  transform SotiobioTech into a pharma company. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=189.56s)]
*  So that's sort of the vision against which we've been working for the past 14 years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=192.48s)]
*  You're based in Prague. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Is there a biotech cluster there or a biopharma cluster? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=199.04s)]
*  Based in Prague, as you can imagine, there have been lots of debates, especially at the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  beginning, whether it's a smart idea to headquarter the company in Prague, because the region [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=208.64s)]
*  is certainly not known to be a biotech hub. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=214.56s)]
*  Nevertheless, this is the decision we made because PPF originates from the Czech Republic. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  PPF originally is headquartered in Prague and lots of its portfolio companies and other [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=223.36s)]
*  businesses are headquartered in Prague. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=228.4s)]
*  So SotiobioTech has a headquarter in Prague and we have offices in Basel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=230.72s)]
*  It sort of is a very convenient location and it's proven to us to be a smart idea to have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=235.88s)]
*  a Basel office because there we were able to get access to the clinical development [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  expertise because of the Basel, a big pharma environment. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=245.4s)]
*  And then we have a relatively small office in Boston from which we run our CAR T-cell [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=248.88s)]
*  therapy program. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=254.6s)]
*  So Sotiobio geographically now is Prague, Basel and Boston offices. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=255.6s)]
*  To get back to your question, I would not say that in Czech Republic or actually anywhere [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=261.04s)]
*  in the center Eastern Europe at this stage, you would find a region that you could call [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=266.32s)]
*  a biotech hub or a biotech cluster. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=271.24s)]
*  As far as I can comment on, we are by far the most ambitious vision enterprise in this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  domain. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  And as I said already, up until now, we've been sort of exclusively financed by one entity [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=282.44s)]
*  because of at the beginning, a personal motivation by the owner of PPF and now because of a dedication [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=288.0s)]
*  of PPF to biotech activities. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  Nevertheless, I see over the course of the last few years, maybe five, seven years, that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=297.8s)]
*  from time to time, you now start seeing biotech startups popping up, usually backed by local [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=303.8s)]
*  investors at the beginning. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=311.16s)]
*  Many of them not really focused on real innovative clinical development, but you rather see, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=314.04s)]
*  but I generalize it, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=320.8s)]
*  I will not comment on specific companies, but many of them you see are companies that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  focus on the diagnostics rather than on the development of innovative compounds. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  But you see more and more that there is an ambition, I think, of various investors and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=332.76s)]
*  even states to encourage these sort of activities within the region, which would help a lot. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=338.88s)]
*  Pharma companies historically have always been building their sales and marketing departments [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  over here, but you rarely see that the big pharma would commit their innovative type [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=350.96s)]
*  of activities in the region. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is now changing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  I now saw actually quite impressive big pharma companies' activities starting in Poland. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=360.08s)]
*  So it seems that the situation is gradually changing, but still far from being a biotech [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  hub. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=371.56s)]
*  Are there any advantages to being in Prague or any disadvantages, maybe? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=372.56s)]
*  The advantage you have over here is that you have access to very talented, well-educated, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=377.4s)]
*  well-trained people, especially in the preclinical development or R&D type of activities. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=382.88s)]
*  You get lots of very talented graduate students coming up from their sort of scientific training, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=390.64s)]
*  coming up from their PhD programs. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=397.32s)]
*  You get lots of people or more and more people coming back from their postdocs, either in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=399.56s)]
*  Western Europe or in the U.S. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=404.67999999999995s)]
*  So I think the talent pool, especially in the preclinical development and in R&D, is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=406.48s)]
*  pretty large. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  And as there are not that many opportunities for them, meaning the companies where they [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=414.16s)]
*  can go to, it's actually quite good for us in terms of selecting the best talent here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  Another advantage, in a way, for potential investors or people starting biotech activities [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=424.88s)]
*  over here is that still the cost of labor over here, the personal cost, is significantly [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=430.88s)]
*  lower than what you see in Western Europe and is obviously even lower, much lower than [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=436.04s)]
*  what you have in the U.S. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=441.32s)]
*  So we are able to do things cheaper than what I often see for U.S. programs. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=442.32s)]
*  And we are able, and that's my strong conviction, to do them at a similar quality and at the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  same speed, which I consider an advantage, definitely. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  A disadvantage, there I have a clear answer that will probably not surprise anybody. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  The disadvantage is that we lack the pool of really experienced people, meaning people [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=466.16s)]
*  who would really be experiencing advanced clinical development of innovative drugs, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=471.64000000000004s)]
*  meaning clinical development experts, medical directors. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=477.24s)]
*  This is certainly a handicap of the region. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=481.04s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why at the end we made a decision to open up the office in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  Basel because our medical department sits over there because it was impossible for us [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  to hire a CMO in this region in Prague. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=493.68s)]
*  Moving on to some of the things that you do, I guess most people would know what antibody [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  drug conjugates are, but what are bi-specific antibody drug conjugates? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  At SOTIO, as I said at the beginning, we actually are on the quest to create or have been on [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  the quest to create a portfolio of multiple oncology programs. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=513.28s)]
*  So within the company, we have historically been working on various technologies. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=517.44s)]
*  At this stage, we have a clinical stage program in cell therapies. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=522.12s)]
*  We have a next generation CAR-T program that is currently in phase one. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  We have quite a lot of expertise with respect to developing cytokines, especially an IL-15 [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=530.6400000000001s)]
*  derived cytokine that we can couple with targeting antibodies. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=537.48s)]
*  That's another clinical stage program that we have at this stage and that is currently [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  in the dose escalation in phase one. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=546.92s)]
*  But for the last seven years or so, we've been sort of gaining more and more expertise [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  in the field of antibody drug conjugates. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=554.76s)]
*  As you just said, we initially started with one technology derived from a Basel-based [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=556.92s)]
*  company called NBE, which we used for the development of our lead program in the domain [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=563.76s)]
*  of antibody drug conjugates. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=569.64s)]
*  That's now in the clinics. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=571.5999999999999s)]
*  We started two additional preclinical programs in the domain of classical ADCs. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=573.64s)]
*  So at this stage, we have three active ADC programs within the company. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=579.36s)]
*  And we've been, as ADCs took off and as it's now probably the hottest field in oncology [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=583.76s)]
*  development, we've been wondering how to make sure that we as a small biotech company remain [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=588.64s)]
*  competitive and still have an edge over big pharma companies that are now putting lots [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=595.24s)]
*  of resources into the development of ADCs. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=601.14s)]
*  And we decided a year ago to also add a technology that would allow us to move into the domain [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=603.5s)]
*  of bi-specific ADCs. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=609.9799999999999s)]
*  As you said, with bi-specific ADCs, you are basically trying to follow two concepts, two [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=612.06s)]
*  possible concepts. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=618.14s)]
*  You create an antibody molecule that can bind in the case of an ADC to two distinct, usually [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=619.7399999999999s)]
*  two distinct tumor antigens. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=626.18s)]
*  Once you have this construct, you attach a payload. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=629.3s)]
*  That's how we call it in the ADC world, a toxin, a toxic compound to this bi-specific [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=633.0600000000001s)]
*  antibody molecule. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=637.86s)]
*  And the idea obviously is that the antibody molecule would target the ADC to the site [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=639.34s)]
*  of the tumor, to the cells that express the respective tumor antigens. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=645.62s)]
*  And there are sort of two scenarios, two ideas, two concepts behind the bi-specific ADC concept. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=649.7s)]
*  One of them is that you may generate a bi-specific ADC that expresses two different tumor antigens. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=656.62s)]
*  And you would get a molecule that only works when you have a tumor cell that expresses [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=663.38s)]
*  both tumor antigens. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=668.44s)]
*  Then the molecule binds to the tumor cell, is internalized, the toxin is cleaved and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=670.46s)]
*  the tumor cell is killed. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=676.34s)]
*  We are working on this concept of what I just described, the elegance and sort of the hope [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=677.74s)]
*  for this sort of approach is that by having two tumor antigens and by having a molecule [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=683.7800000000001s)]
*  that only works on tumor cells that express both tumor antigens, you may increase the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  safety of those molecules. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=693.7s)]
*  Because two tumor antigens need to be expressed on one cell in order for the molecule to work, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=695.74s)]
*  which then decreases the risk that you would have healthy cells somewhere in the kidney, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=700.94s)]
*  for instance, that would express one of those antigens. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=706.58s)]
*  And in case the molecule binds to kidneys and makes damage to the kidney cells, obviously [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=709.86s)]
*  that's a huge toxicity that would prevent further clinical development. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=714.9s)]
*  The second concept is slightly different and requires a different R&D effort. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=718.52s)]
*  There the concept is that you have tumors, I would use prostate cancer as an example, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=724.18s)]
*  where a fraction of cells, 70% of cells express one tumor antigen, and then you have 30% of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=729.14s)]
*  cells that are unfortunately negative for that antigen, but express a different tumor [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=736.98s)]
*  antigen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=742.06s)]
*  And then the idea of a bispecific antibody would be perfect. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=743.14s)]
*  Then let's try to circumvent the problem of not having all the cells expressing one tumor [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=747.54s)]
*  antigen by creating a bispecific antibody that again would target those two tumor antigens. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=753.08s)]
*  But this time we want to create a molecule and optimize the molecule that would work [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=759.06s)]
*  in both scenarios. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=765.42s)]
*  That would work in the case it binds to one of those tumor antigens, but it would also [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=766.76s)]
*  work in the case it binds to the other tumor antigen. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=771.9s)]
*  And in this scenario, you would basically have one universal ADC, bispecific ADC, that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=775.02s)]
*  would help you to cover the majority of the tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=781.12s)]
*  So that's the concept behind bispecific ADC. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=786.52s)]
*  I mean, I spoke for a long time, but it's relatively simple when you talk about the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=789.16s)]
*  concepts, but it's tremendously challenging when you then really try to design those [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=793.64s)]
*  molecules and optimize them. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=798.68s)]
*  What are the challenges of working with bispecific ADCs? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=801.08s)]
*  There are many. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=805.0s)]
*  I'll just try to comment on the most obvious ones. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=806.6s)]
*  The first one is already the concept of how to create a molecule that has two different [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=810.16s)]
*  binding sites. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=815.66s)]
*  You know, how to make sure that the molecule is not too big in order to penetrate to the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=816.66s)]
*  tissues, how to make sure that both binding sites for the tumor antigens are easily accessible [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=822.44s)]
*  and they perform their function. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=829.16s)]
*  For that, we basically, just like many others, reviewed many technologies that are out there [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=831.8000000000001s)]
*  that are available for the production of bispecific antibodies. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=838.72s)]
*  At this stage, we decided to go for one of them for the technology that has been developed [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=842.0s)]
*  by the company BioCytogen, but there are multiple technologies that allow you to produce bispecific [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=847.8s)]
*  antibodies. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=853.08s)]
*  The bigger challenge or the next challenge that all of us trying to work in this field [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=854.08s)]
*  have is to make sure that both antibody components bind us as they are called, both bind us, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=859.96s)]
*  both parts of the antibody that bind the tumor antigen are present at the optimal state, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=867.28s)]
*  that both of them are able to bind the tumor antigen at the optimal affinity, that both [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=872.76s)]
*  those parts are able to induce internalization of the molecule, that after the internalization, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=880.2s)]
*  the toxin gets released. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=886.0s)]
*  And it's easy when I say it this way, but as you imagine, when you have a bispecific [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=887.64s)]
*  antibody at the end that you want to test in patients, you basically have a certain [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=893.16s)]
*  dose of the antibody in a vial and you just inject it intravenously into the patient. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=897.0s)]
*  And at that time, the concentration and the dose is set and you need to have both binders [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=901.96s)]
*  develop the way that at this specified dose and concentration, both antibodies work, which [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=907.32s)]
*  is not obvious. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=914.36s)]
*  For many years and for many drugs, you usually need to dose optimize every single monoclonal [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  antibody that you are using. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=921.24s)]
*  And here you have basically two different monoclonal antibodies and you need to make [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=923.08s)]
*  sure that they work and function at a defined dose and at the defined concentration, which [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=927.48s)]
*  obviously is a huge topic for our R&D activities. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=933.96s)]
*  Earlier, you mentioned some of the benefits of using bispecific KDCs. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=937.12s)]
*  Are there any other benefits? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=943.32s)]
*  This one strategy would be to have two molecules that need to be engaged on the tumor cell [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=945.0s)]
*  in order for the antibody to be active, which would improve what is called therapeutic margin [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=949.88s)]
*  or safety of the compound. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=955.2s)]
*  So that's certainly explored. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=957.24s)]
*  The other one that I mentioned is that you can make it the other way. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=959.0s)]
*  You can create a molecule where you only need one molecule that targets two tumor antigens [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=962.48s)]
*  and is able to cover a large majority of patients because with one molecule you can target two [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=967.7s)]
*  different tumor antigens. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=974.36s)]
*  Generally speaking, yet another advantage of bispecific molecules is that you can obviously [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=976.68s)]
*  play with the molecules you are targeting. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=982.12s)]
*  And there are obviously also concepts and ideas where, for instance, one molecule binds [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=986.16s)]
*  to the tumor target and the other molecule may attract T cells, cells of the immune system [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=992.12s)]
*  to the tumor via binding to their receptor, which is an actively explored concept of bispecific [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1000.76s)]
*  antibodies with a very smart idea that on one hand you are killing the tumor cells [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  by the ADC part of the antibody. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1012.88s)]
*  On the other hand, you are also sort of inducing and supporting the immune reaction against [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1015.5600000000001s)]
*  the tumor. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1022.36s)]
*  So there are multiple attractive aspects of bispecific antibodies. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1023.36s)]
*  Do they address the challenge of balancing efficacy and offsite toxicity? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  The concept that I mentioned as the first one is a concept that has the ambition to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1033.44s)]
*  improve the safety aspects of ADC molecules. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1039.78s)]
*  Again, maybe it will be easier to explain when I use a specific example. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  So in the prostate cancer, there have been attempts for the last maybe 20 years to develop [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1047.48s)]
*  an ADC that would target PSMA, an antigen that is very well known. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1053.16s)]
*  In the case of the prostate cancer, most of the prostate cancer patients have tumors that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1060.12s)]
*  are positive for PSMA. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1065.1s)]
*  However, the issue of developing PSMA based ADC is that PSMA is also expressed on healthy [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  cells. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  It's expressed on salivary glands. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  It's expressed in kidney tubules. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1077.1599999999999s)]
*  So historically it's been difficult to develop a PSMA based ADC, although it would be a very [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1079.5s)]
*  elegant and smart molecule. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1087.76s)]
*  The issue is especially the kidney toxicity. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1089.8s)]
*  So I think in this case, it would make sense to try to have a molecule that targets not [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1093.28s)]
*  only PSMA, but also yet another tumor antigen expressed in the prostate and to have a molecule [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1098.2s)]
*  that only works in case both targets are engaged so that you eliminate the risk of the kidney [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1105.1599999999999s)]
*  or salivary glands toxicity. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1111.24s)]
*  So yes, one of the ambitions of bispecific molecules is also to improve the safety margin. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1113.8s)]
*  There seems to be kind of a hot topic right now. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1119.76s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1123.68s)]
*  The field of classical ADCs is also a tremendously hot field, right? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1125.28s)]
*  But you now see lots of molecules being approved. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1129.52s)]
*  You see that most big pharma companies have entered the field and they are speeding up [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1132.8799999999999s)]
*  the development of many classical ADC molecules. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1139.0s)]
*  So I think now the shift that you see towards the bispecific molecules is first guided by [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1143.16s)]
*  smaller biotechs and research teams trying to move the ADC concept to the next level [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1150.8400000000001s)]
*  and differentiate a little bit from the mainstream. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1157.44s)]
*  That's probably fair to say, but then there are good scientific reasons to believe that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1160.4s)]
*  there are clinical situations, there are tumors where it would make more sense to try to target [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1166.48s)]
*  two tumor antigens at the same time rather than to go after just one because it does not always work. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1172.04s)]
*  One tumor antigen is not always expressed on all tumor cells. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1177.88s)]
*  Again, because it's been such a hot area, I guess there have been quite a few deals recently. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1182.52s)]
*  I wonder if you could tell me maybe about some of those and also your own partnership with biocytogen. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1188.68s)]
*  Yeah, very active area in terms of deal making. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1195.08s)]
*  I'm not really able to comment on the competitive deals here because you don't see many details revealed. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1198.6s)]
*  Apart from the fact that bigger players certainly want to enter the field, I'm sure they always do [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1205.1599999999999s)]
*  a detailed review of the available technologies that allow you to generate bispecific antibodies. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1211.32s)]
*  And then usually the structure of the deal, you get the right for in-licensing of a certain number of molecules, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1217.24s)]
*  three, four, five slots, three to five shots on goal. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1225.32s)]
*  And for each of those programs that you then start developing within your company, your entity, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1229.0s)]
*  they are defined upfront and milestone payments that are usually not disclosed. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1236.28s)]
*  Our deal with biocytogen is no different. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1242.2s)]
*  Classical structure, we like biocytogen technology. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1246.12s)]
*  We were encouraged by the data that they showed us with respect to them being able to create fully humanized [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1251.1599999999999s)]
*  bispecific antibodies against targets of interest. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1258.52s)]
*  And a plus for us with respect to the biocytogen collaboration is that they actually also have [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1262.6s)]
*  readily available an ADC technology that you can use immediately to create bispecific ADC molecules. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1269.08s)]
*  So it's not just us in licensing bispecific binders, the bispecific component, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  but it's also about being able to collaborate with biocytogen on the specific design of the bispecific ADC as such. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  We signed the deal a few months ago. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1292.12s)]
*  Could you tell us a little bit about SOT 102? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1295.72s)]
*  SOT 102 is our lead ADC program. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1298.6799999999998s)]
*  With respect to SOT 102, we are talking about the classical ADC monoclonal antibody [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1301.88s)]
*  that is linked to a very toxic payload called PNU. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1307.72s)]
*  We started SOT 102 maybe five years ago from scratch within SOTEO, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1312.1200000000001s)]
*  where we decided to try to create an ADC molecule against a target called Chlodine 18.2. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1318.8400000000001s)]
*  It has since that moment, it has become a popular target because of encouraging clinical data [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  coming from Astella's program. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1332.52s)]
*  Chlodine 18.2 is a molecule that is expressed in approximately half of patients with gastric cancer [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1334.84s)]
*  and about 30% of patients with pancreatic cancer. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1341.32s)]
*  So two cancers with very sort of dismal prognosis and really big unmet medical need. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1344.3600000000001s)]
*  So the choice of a target certainly, I guess, was a very smart idea at that time. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1351.64s)]
*  We have generated a proprietary monoclonal antibody against Chlodine 18.2 [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1357.16s)]
*  that we believe has great characteristics. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1363.16s)]
*  And we then generated an ADC molecule using, again, the technology of NB-etherapeutics. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1365.3200000000002s)]
*  At that time, it was a Basel-based company in Switzerland. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1372.76s)]
*  Over the time, it got acquired by Bering-Ingelheim, but we are using this ADC technology. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1377.96s)]
*  So we have a Chlodine 18.2 antibody and PNU and anthracycline-based payload, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1383.64s)]
*  a very strong payload with potent anti-tumor activity. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1390.04s)]
*  SOT 102 is now in phase one in pancreatic cancer. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1393.8s)]
*  It has a very clear clinical development plan because it's expressed in pancreatic cancer patients. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1398.44s)]
*  And as unfortunately, most of the pancreatic cancer patients fail initial chemotherapy, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1404.76s)]
*  that's the time when they enter then our clinical program. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1411.08s)]
*  At this stage, it's the dose escalation. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1415.16s)]
*  And already at the low doses that we tested, we actually see some encouraging signs of [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1417.8s)]
*  clinical efficacy. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1423.72s)]
*  At this stage, we see patients who have sort of long-term stable disease [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1424.68s)]
*  and we hope to be able to dose escalate. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1429.16s)]
*  With ADCs, the concern and the risk that you always face is that the molecule will be toxic [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1432.28s)]
*  before you see clinical efficacy signals. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1438.52s)]
*  And this is the stage where we are right now. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1441.24s)]
*  We are dose escalating in pancreatic cancer. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1443.32s)]
*  We have a clear clinical development plan and we hope to see clear signs of clinical efficacy, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1446.28s)]
*  hopefully with acceptable safety profile. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1452.28s)]
*  Is there anything else in your pipeline that you're working on or is it just the one? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1455.48s)]
*  At this stage, it's this clinical stage coordinating 18.2 program. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1459.48s)]
*  And then we have two tangible ADC programs that are approximately one and a half years [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1463.64s)]
*  from entering the clinics. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1470.52s)]
*  We plan to disclose the molecules probably beginning of next year. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1472.28s)]
*  Once we have lead candidate molecules defined, then those bispecific programs we talked about. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1476.2s)]
*  And in addition to that, within SOTEO, we have two technologies that don't belong to ADCs. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1483.24s)]
*  We have a CAR T program that I mentioned already. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1490.2s)]
*  We believe we have novel concept for producing CAR T cells, a concept that we call BOXA. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1494.3600000000001s)]
*  It's basically a CAR T cells with an additional transgene that increases the fitness of the CAR [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1501.64s)]
*  T cell and its ability to survive in hypoxic tumor microenvironment, tumor microenvironment [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1507.96s)]
*  with low glucose levels. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1514.44s)]
*  Our lead program is targeting a molecule called GPC3, which is expressed in certain sarcomas [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1516.6s)]
*  in hepatocytes carcinoma. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1524.2s)]
*  And we are now also in the dose escalation. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1526.28s)]
*  We are in the phase one part of the program, hopefully having the recommended phase two [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1529.96s)]
*  dose for this CAR T construct sometime mid next year. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1536.68s)]
*  And then the third program that is in the clinic is a molecule that basically is a [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1540.92s)]
*  combination of an anti PD1 molecule, a checkpoint inhibitor that is coupled, fused to a cytokine [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1546.52s)]
*  called interleukin 15. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1556.1200000000001s)]
*  And we like to talk about this molecule as a next generation checkpoint inhibitor molecule [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1558.1200000000001s)]
*  because it has a function of anti PD1. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1563.64s)]
*  But in addition to that, the interleukin 15 component nicely stimulates cytotoxic T cells [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1567.48s)]
*  and K cells into tumor, which further helps to sort of potentiate the immune response [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1575.4s)]
*  in the tumor. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1581.24s)]
*  So this program entered the clinics June this year. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1582.44s)]
*  And I guess we have, let's say a year or a year and a half of those escalation ahead [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1587.0s)]
*  of us, but it's certainly a molecule that we are really excited about. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1592.36s)]
*  So that sort of clinical pipeline of SOTIO at this stage. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1596.9199999999998s)]
*  Obviously some of this is in its infancy in some respects, but what do you see as the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1601.1599999999999s)]
*  future for bi-specific ADCs? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1606.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sort of commenting on the global situation, right? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1610.28s)]
*  As far as I can tell from what is publicly available, there is a huge number of preclinical [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1615.24s)]
*  programs. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1620.68s)]
*  Clearly many biotechs, even pharma companies are looking into the field. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1621.3200000000002s)]
*  They are now defining their molecules, designing their molecules. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1627.4s)]
*  As far as I know, it seems like there are now maybe 10 programs in the clinics early [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1631.64s)]
*  in the phase one. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1638.2s)]
*  So I guess that within the next three years or so, the field should know whether the [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1639.5600000000002s)]
*  concept is valid and whether you see that there is any sort of superiority or an edge [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1646.6s)]
*  over the classical ADC approach. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1652.04s)]
*  And yeah, our ambition and our goal is to be early in the race and hopefully get some [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1654.52s)]
*  of SOTIO internal programs to the clinics in the frame of two to three years, something [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1660.9199999999998s)]
*  like that. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1666.36s)]
*  And I guess it's all ultimately about patients. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1667.48s)]
*  What does all of this mean for patients in the long term? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1670.28s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1674.52s)]
*  To say it bluntly for ADCs, it's first about the selection of the targets of the molecules [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1675.96s)]
*  that you target on the tumors. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1681.4s)]
*  Then once you have this decision, it's relatively straightforward then to determine the clinical [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1683.56s)]
*  development plan to design the trials. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1690.3600000000001s)]
*  And the fact that ADCs are very potent molecules actually brings one advantage, which is that [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1693.16s)]
*  for many ADCs, you see whether there is a clinical proof of concept, clinical, whether [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1700.6s)]
*  there are signs of clinical efficacy actually quite early in the process. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1706.76s)]
*  So there are many ADC programs where you see clear signs of clinical efficacy already during [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1710.92s)]
*  the dose escalation, which then obviously allows you to design your clinical program [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1716.92s)]
*  more aggressively. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1723.6399999999999s)]
*  So many of the ADCs you now see on the market went through the clinical development program [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1724.92s)]
*  rather quickly because there were clear signs of efficacy and it was possible for the companies [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1729.64s)]
*  to really design sort of ambitious, statistically aggressive clinical development programs. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1734.2800000000002s)]
*  A really enjoyable conversation there with Radek. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1745.3200000000002s)]
*  Hopefully we see both Prague developing as a biotech hub and the company's buy specific [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1748.2800000000002s)]
*  ADC approach bearing fruit. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1754.2800000000002s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1757.1599999999999s)]
*  and I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1763.32s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSXDMK4Lus&t=1767.48s)]
