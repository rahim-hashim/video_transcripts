Video Description: Aurion Biotech is a US biotech with a regenerative medicine platform, developing novel therapies to restore vision to millions of people in need. 


This week on the podcast, we have a conversation with CEO Greg Kunst about Aurion’s pipeline, and how the company’s treatment could be the first mass-market cell therapy available.


The FDA has granted the company BTD and RMAT designations for AURN001 -- the first-ever allogeneic cell therapy candidate in development to restore vision in patients with corneal endothelial disease. This is a condition with around 16 million patients in the US, Japan and Europe alone. The current standard of care is currently transplant surgery.


Aurion's proprietary process can turn cells from one donor cornea into more than treatments, with the potential to scale to more than 1,000, closing the gap on the global shortage of donor corneas.


Aurion recently completed enrollment of a phase 1/2 trial in the US and Canada.


00:43-01:53: About Aurion
01:53-03:12: What are allogeneic cell therapies?
03:12-04:11: Why is the eye a good target for allogeneic cell therapy?
04:11-06:16: What is corneal endothelial disease?
06:16-07:18: Is corneal endothelial disease genetic or just age related?
07:18-09:22: Is transplant surgery the only option?
09:22-10:58: Are other companies working on corneal endothelial disease treatments?
10:58-12:26: How does your treatment work?
12:26-13:36: Does your treatment alleviate the shortage of corneas?
13:36-15:47: How would you get your treatments around the world?
15:47-17:02: Could these treatments extend to other diseases?
17:02-18:36: What do you need for a mass market treatment?
18:36-19:36: Will there always be a need for this treatment?
19:36-21:12: Is your treatment easy to administer? 
21:12-22:41: What do the FDA designations mean for Aurion?
22:41-24:38: Where are you with clinical trials?

# The first mass-market cell therapy?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 105. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. This week the subject of the podcast is treating corneal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=17.0s)]
*  endothelial disease, but the treatment is possibly the first mass market cell therapy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=23.28s)]
*  The company that's working on this is Orion Biotech, based in the US, and to tell us how [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=29.76s)]
*  the company is hoping to restore vision in a unique way is Greg Kunst, CEO of Orion. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=35.08s)]
*  Hi Greg, maybe to get things started could you give us an introduction to the company? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  Sure. So, Orion Biotech is a relatively new company. So, we formed the company in 2022. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Orion Biotech came out of a prior company called Corneogen, which was a traditional [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=54.72s)]
*  tissue transplant company. It's been around for a number of years. They had acquired this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=60.28s)]
*  technology out of Japan from a very famous corneal specialist named Shigeru Kenishida. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=65.02s)]
*  And Shigeru started his original work at the bench in 2002 and then got into patients in 2013. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=70.2s)]
*  And so what we're doing is we're addressing a very prevalent disease called corneal endothelial [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=77.76s)]
*  disease with allogenic cell therapy treatment, where we take endothelial cells off of deceased [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=82.6s)]
*  donors and we're able to expand those cells from one donor to up to a thousand treatments and put [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  those into patients who have corneal disease and are starting to lose their vision. So, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=93.96s)]
*  it's a great company. We're based in Seattle. We have a very large presence in Cambridge, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Massachusetts. We have a smaller team in Japan. We're just recently approved in Japan and getting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  ready to commercialize there. Just short of 70 people worldwide. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=108.52s)]
*  Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the interview, if you could give us a bit of background [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=111.92s)]
*  on allogeneic cell therapies. Yeah, allogeneic cell therapies are really, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, we think about where we want to go in cell therapy, it's the Holy Grail cell therapy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=124.24s)]
*  And the reason why that's the case is traditional cell therapies that are approved today are things [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=128.48s)]
*  like CAR-Ts or you need a one donor for one treatment or more importantly, you're taking the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=133.44s)]
*  cells out of the body of someone's disease, you know, you're reprossing and putting back in that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=139.48s)]
*  same person. And while that's been a very meaningful treatment for difficult cancers, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=143.76s)]
*  it's expensive, it's not scalable, it's hard to make it available worldwide. Allogeneic cell [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=150.2s)]
*  therapy is the idea of can we take a cell from a different person, expand those cells, and then [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=156.12s)]
*  put them into a disease patient. And if that promise holds through, there's a multiplier effect [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=162.92s)]
*  in the number of patients that can be treated worldwide. And as of right now, we have very few [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  allogeneic cell therapies that are either in advanced states of development or approved. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  This seems to be what we're working on seems to be one of the most advanced and probably one of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=177.44s)]
*  the most scaled. We believe this is the first mass market cell therapy, you know, our ability [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=181.64s)]
*  to really affect a large population of patients is certainly paramount to what we're doing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  Why is the eye a good target for allogeneic cell therapy? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=191.52s)]
*  It's a great question, because it's very nuanced and important. So there's only two parts of the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  body that are immunoprivileged, and one is the eye. And so we don't deal with immunological [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=200.96s)]
*  responses like the rest of the body. So part of the challenge of other cell therapy targets have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  to deal with is rejection. And that's something that we see in the eye to any great extent. And [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=210.4s)]
*  so that's a huge advantage. The second one is the eye is very accessible. While the eye is small, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=216.24s)]
*  it's easy to get into the eye and put cells in the eye versus if you're using a treatment for, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=220.32s)]
*  let's look at it, you take something like the diabetic approach or cell therapy, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=226.2s)]
*  you've got to get into the pancreas. That's not easy. And that's a pretty invasive procedure. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=230.0s)]
*  The eye is easily accessible. There's lots of ophthalmologists that do ophthalmic surgery. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=233.84s)]
*  And again, the immunological responses are practically nil. So we think this is a very [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=239.04s)]
*  good target for cell therapy in general. But corneal field disease is particularly a good [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=243.72s)]
*  target for allergenic cell therapy. And you just mentioned corneal endothelial disease. I wonder [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=247.64s)]
*  if you could tell me about the disease itself, what it is and how many people have it, that kind [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=254.44s)]
*  of thing. Yeah, what it effectively is, is the endothelial cells are the last layer of tissue [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=260.52s)]
*  that are on the cornea. So the back of the cornea, it's that layer that protects the cornea from [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  the interior parts of the eye. And its function is really has one function. And that function is to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=272.12s)]
*  regulate the amount of fluid that was in and out of cornea. You need some fluid to maintain hydration, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=277.8s)]
*  but not so much that it causes edema and swelling. And we're all born with a certain number of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  endothelial cells. They're like brain cells. They don't naturally regenerate. And as we face aging, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  disease, trauma, those cells start to become reduced. And certain people, they lose enough [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=293.96s)]
*  of these cells, or that function, that pumping function is arrested or slowed. And once that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=298.52s)]
*  happens, the cornea starts to have an influx of aqueous humor or that clear fluid that's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=303.48s)]
*  inside the eye into the corneal tissues, and people start to lose vision. Now here in the United [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=309.32s)]
*  States, admittedly, we have modern corneal transplants available when people get sick enough [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=313.8s)]
*  where they generally speak in their 2060, 2070, 2080, meaning they can't drive a car. They have [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  some vision, but they can't drive a car. They have an option for corneal transplant surgery. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=324.36s)]
*  Outside the US is very hard to find tissue and very hard to find sources to do it. And so in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  many parts of the world, even in advanced economies, we see people go nearly blind from [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  corneal edema disease. And so at a high level, it is a prevalent disease. It's about 16 million people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  at any one given time in the US, Europe, and Japan that have it. It's a bilateral disease, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=345.56s)]
*  so the world is chasing 32 million eyes. Additionally, there's 8 million people in the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=349.56s)]
*  world today that are fully blind from corneal edema disease simply because they don't have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=353.56s)]
*  access to corneal transplants or tissue. So this is a major disease, and this is why we're so [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=357.96s)]
*  focused on the mass marketability of what we're doing. This is not something that can be solved [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  with a thousand treatments a year. This is something that can be solved with, in an ideal state, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  we're treating hundreds of thousands, if not millions of patients a year worldwide. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=371.4s)]
*  Is it purely age-related or is there a genetic component to it? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, great question. So generally speaking, the most prevalent form of corneal edema disease is a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  genetic disease called Fuchs dystrophy. Fuchs dystrophy, the NIH supports that 4% of the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=383.8s)]
*  population over the age of 40 is prevalent for Fuchs dystrophy, but admittedly, the prevalence [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=390.2s)]
*  rate goes up by age. So if you look at someone that is two years old, the prevalence is basically [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=395.8s)]
*  zero or nearly zero. If you look at someone that's the age of 40, it's in the 1 to 2%. By the time [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  you get to the age of 80, it's a high single digit. So it's like cataracts. As you get older [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=407.88s)]
*  and older, the rate of it goes up. Now there are forms of cornea of the disease that are [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=412.28s)]
*  trauma-related or surgical-related, meaning that these are patients that have had prior surgery in [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  the eye that because of either the procedure itself or maybe the surgeon touched the cornea, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=421.32s)]
*  they had a reduction in cornea of the LSLs that cause what's called pseudo-fakic Bowls care [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=426.84s)]
*  topathy. But that's much more rare, particularly inside the US, primarily we see in the US and in [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=430.52s)]
*  western parts of the world is Fuchs dystrophy. You mentioned the option of surgery. Is that really [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=435.88s)]
*  the only treatment for the disease currently? Yeah, I mean, so for early disease, there's a [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  hypertonic drop called Muro that's used to try to get some of the fluid out of the eye. It doesn't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=448.2s)]
*  work very well and it's not indicated for that. It's used off label. However, to really treat an [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=454.04s)]
*  aligned disease, the only real option is corneal transplants. Now over the years, especially [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=459.4s)]
*  gotten better and better at these procedures. So originally it was a full thickness transplantation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=464.2s)]
*  So you take the whole cornea, you take the whole cornea of a deceased donor, you put a new cornea [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=469.0s)]
*  on the diseased eye of the person receiving the donation. That's a big surgery and has a very high [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  failure rates, more than 50%. And then they got smart and said, well, maybe we can use a partial [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=479.32s)]
*  thickness transplant. And that became what's called DSECT. And the rates of rejection are about 20% [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=484.36s)]
*  in a DSECT procedure because you are using endothelial cells decimates and part of stroma. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=491.08000000000004s)]
*  And then the most recent innovation is an even thinner graph called DMEC, which is just decimates [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=496.92s)]
*  and the cells. And that has a low single digit rejection rate. And so we've seen dramatic [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=503.16s)]
*  improvements in this area. The problem though continues to be you need one donor for one treated [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=508.68s)]
*  patient. And these are big surgeries, so it's not scalable. Conversely, what we're doing, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=514.04s)]
*  we're creating with one donor today, we can make up to a thousand treatments. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=519.56s)]
*  I think that number will go up dramatically over time. We've done our development labs many times, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=524.5999999999999s)]
*  many fold over that. But the ability to treat patients goes up dramatically. Additionally, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  it's a simple injection of cells. And so we're able to have this done by any one of those cataract [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=533.4s)]
*  surgeries. So instead of targeting 300 corneal specialists in the US, we're targeting 8,000 [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  cataract cornea refractive specialists and really addressing the population again, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=544.6s)]
*  through our number of treatments we create and by way of the number of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=550.2s)]
*  treaters. And lastly, it's minimally invasive. So we can do it much earlier in the treatment algorithm. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  This has got all the hallmarks of being a big transformation. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=559.16s)]
*  Are there any other companies or is there any other research [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=562.6s)]
*  developing other potential treatments for this? Yeah. I mean, I always say the greatest form of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=566.28s)]
*  flattery is competition. I mean, so this is an emerging area where people are working in the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=570.76s)]
*  space and a lot of work in regenerative medicine in this area, different approaches, some are using [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=575.16s)]
*  IPSC cells. The idea there is you'd have a master cell bank. It's interesting, but the cost of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=580.36s)]
*  manufacturing is very high for that. Additionally, those are actually not endothelial cells. Those [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=586.2s)]
*  are endothelial-like cells. The beauty of the program that we have is we're asking natural [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  endothelial cells to continue to be endothelial cells. And that's why our efficacy and safety [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=595.24s)]
*  profile is so good. And our ability to scale the level we do, I think the advanced IPSC cells are [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=599.48s)]
*  reduced. Additionally, there are other people that are looking at different approaches in the adult [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=604.84s)]
*  differentiated area. There's a program at Stanford using magnets or charged ions within the cells to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=608.2s)]
*  get them to adhes. In our program, we use a therapeutic called Rho-Kinase. It's a well-known [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=614.9200000000001s)]
*  therapeutic approved in ophthalmology for lowering eye pressure. That therapeutic's role in our cell [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=620.76s)]
*  therapy and our final drug product is to help the cells adhere. And we think that's the most [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=627.08s)]
*  benign approach to addressing endothelial disease. There are many others out there as well. I would [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  say we're the first. We're leading the way. We think we have the right solution. And there'll [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=638.5200000000001s)]
*  be people behind us because it's a big category. It's a big area of unmet need. And areas where [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=644.5200000000001s)]
*  there's not additional competition, I always question whether you're addressing something [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=649.64s)]
*  that's really meaningful or not. We clearly are. We see the number of people that are at the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=652.44s)]
*  labs that are working in this area. I wonder if you can go into a little bit more detail on exactly [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=656.84s)]
*  how your treatment works and what the treatment is? Sure. We take from a deceased donor. And the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  greatest gift that someone can give at death is organ donation. So we have people that have agreed [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=667.1600000000001s)]
*  to donate their organs to medicine. We take the corneas from those patients. We remove the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=672.12s)]
*  endothelial cells. Again, these endothelial cells do not naturally regenerate. And we have a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=678.2800000000001s)]
*  proprietary way to turn the regenerative process on in our manufacturing process, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=683.0s)]
*  expand the cells many, many fold over. So again, with one donor, we create a thousand treatments. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=687.96s)]
*  And then we can turn that process off. And by the way, turning the process off is as much, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=692.92s)]
*  if not more important than turning the process on. You certainly don't want a replication process [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=696.36s)]
*  that keeps going for a lot of reasons. And then we suspend those cells into endoparal kinase. That's [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=700.76s)]
*  our final drug product, which helps the cells to adhere to the cornea. So again, what we're doing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=705.72s)]
*  is we're injecting those cells. The cells then form a monolayer. And once that monolayer is formed, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=710.92s)]
*  they start the pumping mechanism. What makes our program so unique is endothelial cells have one [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  function and their function is to pump. It's a single structure of cells. It's not a multi-cellular [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=721.88s)]
*  structure. It's not a multifunctional structure. So this actually makes the target straightforward [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=726.76s)]
*  to what we're trying to do. And I think that's part of the reason why we see such great results is [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=731.4799999999999s)]
*  we're not having to trick the body. We're not having to gene edit. We're not having to type [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=735.56s)]
*  tests. We're not having to do any of the complex biotech items that some of the other cell [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=739.08s)]
*  therapists have to do, which makes our program quite de-risked right now. Does your treatment [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  address that chronic shortage of corneas? I guess it must. What we know is for every 70 [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=747.72s)]
*  diseased eyes worldwide, there's only one donor available. The rates of donation have not changed [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=753.4000000000001s)]
*  in over 30 years. If you go back and look at donation rates for corneas, it's not a viable [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  solution to addressing the field disease at a whole scale. And so by making a thousand treatments [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=763.32s)]
*  every donor, we can treat the entire world today with our supply. Now it will continue to increase [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=769.24s)]
*  our scaling. Our goal is to be able to take this to all around the world. So this is not just a U.S. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=774.44s)]
*  problem or a European problem. This is a worldwide problem. I can tell you out in the developing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=779.4000000000001s)]
*  parts of the world, there are no options. The availability of tissue and the availability of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=784.6s)]
*  surgery and corneal transplant is practically nil. And so we've built a company. We could have [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=788.6s)]
*  stopped in our scaling where we are right now. We'd be very successful in the U.S., Europe, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=793.0s)]
*  and Japan. But we chose to keep working on what we're doing because we want to make this available [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=797.64s)]
*  worldwide. I can see a day in 10 years where this is being done in India and China, and more so in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=801.32s)]
*  Sub-Saharan Africa. And that's the company we've built. We've built our cost structure to do that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=806.6s)]
*  We've built our manufacturing scale to do that. We've built our organization to be able to do that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=811.08s)]
*  And that's exciting. Logistically, how would that work? Would you have to have, I mean, is this [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=815.32s)]
*  something that needs to be kept at a low temperature or how would you get it to some [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=820.92s)]
*  of these countries? Yeah, we've learned a lot about that. So what we know today versus what we [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=826.36s)]
*  knew a year ago, three years ago is very different to me. So we actually can move this at room [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=830.52s)]
*  temperature. Interestingly enough, the cells like warmer temperature than colder temperature. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=835.4799999999999s)]
*  So unlike the vaccines where you've got to keep them deep frozen and somehow we were able to make [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=839.56s)]
*  those get all around the world in the pandemic, this has moved around at room temperature. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=844.52s)]
*  We have shelf life in the final drug product about 10 days. Our drug substance that the cells in the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=848.52s)]
*  manufacturing process have a storage time of about six months. And so how we would handle this in a [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  global environment is we would harvest off doses on a weekly basis and ship around the world. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=858.6s)]
*  Now that's very viable. Today, corneal transplant has about a seven to 10 day shelf life in general [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=865.0s)]
*  when they send corneal tissue. So we have basically the same shelf life as modern [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  corneal transplant and people ship those all around the world. So Corneogen, our partner [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=875.0s)]
*  company, sends transplants to remote Pacific Islands, to Africa, all over the place and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=879.48s)]
*  there's a problem. Their issue is more of they can't scale. You can't scale with corneal transplant, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=886.04s)]
*  but we can ship corneal transplants all around the world. And that's the supply chain we'll use now. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=890.52s)]
*  Eventually, would it be nice to have a cryogenically frozen product that we can put to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=895.56s)]
*  shelf for a long period of time? Yeah, of course. And we'll do that post approval. But for now, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=899.24s)]
*  we think we have a solution. We can still get all around the world. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=904.68s)]
*  And it's just a one-off treatment? One time. The patients that have been reported out of Japan, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=907.0799999999999s)]
*  so at two years in the New England Journal of Medicine and five years in ophthalmology, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=911.9599999999999s)]
*  those patients are 10 years out now. They had one treatment. They're doing amazingly well. So [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  the thinking is by and large, it's a one-time treatment and you're good for life. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  This is also very good news as well. We don't have many of those in disease. I mean, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=924.76s)]
*  you look at most areas of medicine, we don't have many of those. Particularly, we don't have many [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=929.0s)]
*  of those that are very safe. We see gene therapies that can do that. But sometimes gene therapies [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=932.84s)]
*  cause collateral damage, off-target effects. We don't have any of that with cell therapy. So very [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=937.1600000000001s)]
*  benign, very effective, but more importantly, durable for life. You mentioned the fact that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=942.84s)]
*  the eye is a good target for this. Is this a kind of technology that you envisage could potentially [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=948.2800000000001s)]
*  in the future be extended into other areas other than the eye? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=955.48s)]
*  I'm an ophthalmologist. The eye itself has lots of disease areas that have applications. So [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=959.64s)]
*  what we're really addressing is cell death and non-regenerating cells. There are a number of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=965.56s)]
*  diseases of the eye that either are under-treated or untreated today where cell death is the primary [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=970.4399999999999s)]
*  cause of vision loss. That's where we'll go because again, the advantages of immunoprivileged [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=974.8399999999999s)]
*  nature of the eye, the accessibility of the eye, our knowledge base is organization, how eye [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=979.4s)]
*  diseases work. That's where we'll spend our time and focus. So I think if we look five, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=983.8s)]
*  10 years down the horizon, who will Orion Biotech be when they grow up, I think will be [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=987.24s)]
*  the world leader in cell therapy and ophthalmic disease. I don't see us in the near term going [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=991.4s)]
*  into other parts of the body, but I do think the promise to cell therapy without question has great [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=995.96s)]
*  application in other parts of the body. I think we have work to do in oncology. I think we've seen [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1000.84s)]
*  success in hematological diseases with CAR-T's. We haven't so much in solid tumor disease, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1006.12s)]
*  so more work to be done there. Hopefully we see breakthroughs there by other companies. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1012.6s)]
*  Obviously the autoimmune diseases are starting to show some promise, but again, that's not an area [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1017.08s)]
*  that we're targeting as a company. You mentioned about this being kind of the first mass market [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  cell therapy. Could you kind of expand on that? When I mean about mass market, you need a couple [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1026.44s)]
*  things. One, you need to be able to scale at a significant level. And so again, we talk about [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1031.56s)]
*  a thousand treatments to one donor. That would address worldwide disease in its entirety just [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1036.04s)]
*  with our current scaling. So number two is you have to do it in a cost-effective way. And we've got our [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1041.88s)]
*  scaling at a level where I fundamentally believe we can take this all around the world. I mean, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1046.28s)]
*  what we've talked about internally is we've got our cost because at a level now if we have to give [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1050.6s)]
*  it away in Africa, we'll do that. We'll do fine in the Western world. We'll make a reasonable profit, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1054.28s)]
*  a responsible profit in the Western world, but in other parts of the world where they may not have [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1059.3999999999999s)]
*  the economic feasibility to pay for such a treatment, we have a way to make that available. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1064.68s)]
*  And so that's the other part of the mass market. The third part is does it fit in the modern [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1069.08s)]
*  logistics system? And I think we've seen with the pandemic with vaccines and certainly we've [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1072.92s)]
*  seen with corneal tissue, we can move cells around pretty easily around the world. Heck, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1076.68s)]
*  during the pandemic, we were doing studies in El Salvador and how we were bringing the cells in. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  We would make the cells in Kyoto, Japan and ship them to San Salvador, El Salvador. If you can [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  imagine with all the air travel shut down in 2020 and 2021, how difficult that would be. And we were [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1091.72s)]
*  still able to move cells and treat patients. And so if we can do it then we can do it in normal [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1098.28s)]
*  time. So that's what I think about when I think about the mass market nature of what we're doing. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1101.8s)]
*  That's important only if the disease is highly prevalent, which this disease is, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1105.72s)]
*  and if the disease is global in nature. And it appears that corneal tissue disease is pervasive [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1109.8s)]
*  around the world. And I guess with some diseases as well, if it's either a rare disease or if it's [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1114.52s)]
*  something that you cure, you don't, I guess in commercial terms, you don't necessarily have that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1120.84s)]
*  market anymore. But with something like this, everybody is going to age. So it's going to be [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1126.92s)]
*  something that generation upon generation will need. Yeah, there's 32 million eyes that are [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1132.92s)]
*  prevalent, but there's about a million eyes that are incident every single year. So, you know, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1138.44s)]
*  there's plenty of patients just in the incident population, a million eyes per year for cell [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1142.3600000000001s)]
*  therapy is a lot. Then the CAR T side, I think CAR T's are barely not even over 100,000 treatments [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1148.04s)]
*  a year. If we're doing a million treatments a year, we'd look like an antibody or a small molecule [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1153.32s)]
*  in the number of treatments that we're providing. And so that's what we're targeting. So to your [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1159.48s)]
*  point, even if we get so lucky to treat all 32 million eyes in the Western world, corneal [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1163.32s)]
*  disease, just the yearly patients that come in the system are plenty for us to treat and clearly [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  still a mass market area. You were talking about how this is a one-time deal when it comes to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1174.12s)]
*  getting the treatment. Is it something that is very easy to deliver? I mean, if you're talking [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1179.8s)]
*  about doing this in Africa, Asia, is it something that local doctors would be able to administer? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1184.84s)]
*  That's one of the primary benefits of what we do. So this is a procedure which has three steps. So [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1192.12s)]
*  step one is we make an incision in the eye, we do a small little windshield wiper technique [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1197.56s)]
*  onto the disease and the other end, that's to try to wipe off the disease cells. Step two, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1202.2s)]
*  we inject cells. In step three, we put patients face down up to three hours, probably closer to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1206.52s)]
*  an hour in the real world, but post-operative for now, it's three hours. That's it. I mean, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1212.12s)]
*  in step one through two is not a very long procedure. And it's something that's in the [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1217.48s)]
*  skill sets of any ophthalmologist who does interior segment surgery. So that means all cataract [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1221.56s)]
*  specialists, all refractive specialists, all guacoma specialists, all corneal specialists. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1226.2s)]
*  And in plain numbers, if we take that same construct, today there's about 300 corneal [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1232.12s)]
*  specialists in the US that do corneal transplant. In Japan, there are about 50. Conversely, in the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1237.2399999999998s)]
*  US there's 8,000 cataract specialists and in Japan, there's about 2,000 cataract specialists. So just [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  by getting it out into the broader audience, you dramatically change the treater base. And that's [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1250.04s)]
*  really important in the US and Japan and Europe, but even more important out in more developed [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1255.56s)]
*  parts of the world. In the developed parts of the world, they do cataract surgery, they do retina [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1259.72s)]
*  surgery. That's about it. So if you can get a treatment like this in the hands of cataracts [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1263.24s)]
*  specialists, your ability to really get to patients goes up exponentially. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1267.16s)]
*  What do the recent FDA designations mean for the company? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1272.04s)]
*  That's all good news. I mean, so we received about a month ago both breakthrough status and [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1275.8s)]
*  R-MAT status. So breakthrough status is the highest designation one can receive at the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1280.52s)]
*  early parts of development. Really, it's a fast-tracker program. Your breakthrough status [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1286.36s)]
*  requires you to be addressing a serious disease that causes either loss of life or loss of function [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1290.6799999999998s)]
*  in the body. And you have to demonstrate evidence that your treatment actually has data to support [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1296.84s)]
*  that you would supplant standard care. And so that we received, there's only been three opomic drugs, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1302.76s)]
*  including ours, that have received it. So that's a big positive and a really good sign that we're [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1308.36s)]
*  in the right direction. R-MAT is a program reserved for cell therapies. This is a newer [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1312.28s)]
*  pathway that the FDA uses for novel cell therapies. And R-MAT and breakthrough work very similarly. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1317.6399999999999s)]
*  We do not know how many programs have both, but I'm pretty sure it's very rare. We may have won [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1324.04s)]
*  a handful of programs in the world who have gotten both. We've had FDA discussions the last [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1328.84s)]
*  month. They are bringing everything to bear to move this as quickly as possible. The right people [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1333.48s)]
*  in the room are in our discussions. The frequency of discussions are much greater, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1338.12s)]
*  and the willingness to be flexible with the FDA is greater. So I think all it means in plain English [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1342.9199999999998s)]
*  is this will help us get a much higher probability of success approval and a much faster approval [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  than we originally targeted. The desire of the programs is to get promising treatments to patients [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1352.4399999999998s)]
*  faster. And we're already seeing that in the first month we've had a designation. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1357.6399999999999s)]
*  Connected to that, where are you at with clinical trials? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1361.6399999999999s)]
*  We fully enrolled approximately 100 patients in phase 1 and 2 back early this year, so in April. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1365.16s)]
*  We started that trial in October. We made a classic mistake of don't start a trial in the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1371.16s)]
*  middle of the holiday. So basically we enrolled five patients between the end of October and January [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1375.0s)]
*  1. Then we went from January 1 to the middle of April and we enrolled a little over 90 patients. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1380.04s)]
*  I tend to say we enrolled the trial in four months. That's an unheard of enrollment time period [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1384.8400000000001s)]
*  for a novel first in class, fully blinded, randomized control trial, large randomized control [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1389.5600000000002s)]
*  trial and ophthalmology. And so I think it's a good signal that we have a lot of patients out [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1393.96s)]
*  there that need treatment. And more so we had to turn away patients at the end because we close [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1397.96s)]
*  the study down at the end as we hit our study numbers. So that's exciting. So what that means [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1401.48s)]
*  for us is we'll have data early next year. We'll then enter our phase 3 trials about this time next [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  year. And we're kind of looking right now at an approval sometime in 28, maybe faster with [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1411.72s)]
*  breakthrough. That's kind of TBD at this stage. But I think the base case at 28, and I can see [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1416.3600000000001s)]
*  scenarios where we're anywhere from 6 to 18 months earlier, depending on where the FDA comes out. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1420.6s)]
*  Is there anything else that we didn't talk about that you wanted to mention? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1425.48s)]
*  The mass market is this program, I think really puts cell therapy on the map. I mean, cell [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  therapies thus far have been reserved for, you know, frankly, wealthy countries and then they [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1433.56s)]
*  reserve for the most sick patients in the world. I think we're challenging that dogma. Is cell [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1438.84s)]
*  therapy available for the masses? And can cell therapy be used worldwide? And I think that's, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1443.6399999999999s)]
*  I think for your listeners, that's one of the takeaways I'd like to get across is we're doing [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1448.04s)]
*  that day in and day out. And, you know, I kind of challenge the industry, we need to get better at [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1451.48s)]
*  making sure that our treatments are available globally and push ourselves around the area [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1455.8s)]
*  to scaling to get the cost structure down where people can take any treatment in these cell [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1460.6000000000001s)]
*  therapies around the world. Some of the cell therapy that Cartes used as an example, I mean, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1465.16s)]
*  they're miracle drugs in hematological diseases, but they're only available to a slight few. And [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1469.0s)]
*  that's not the approach we're taking to orient biotech. We're addressing a global problem with [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1473.8s)]
*  a global solution. Well, it seems like this is one development that's going to make a huge [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1477.08s)]
*  difference to a lot of people around the world. The word transformative does get thrown around a [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1486.6799999999998s)]
*  lot, not unlike the word disruptive. But it really seems that Orion's work is going to be truly [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1493.8799999999999s)]
*  transformative and hopefully in the not too distant future. Don't forget to check out the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1501.0s)]
*  latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu. And I hope wherever in the world you are, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YZdO0LtiXI&t=1506.92s)]
