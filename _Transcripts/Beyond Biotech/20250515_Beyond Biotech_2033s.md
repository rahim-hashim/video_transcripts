# Fighting mucopolysaccharidosis type I, a rare disease, by reprogramming B-cells
**Beyond Biotech:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from the Biotech. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dylan Cassane and this is episode 147 for the podcast. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=10.68s)]
*  There are cell therapies, gene therapies and biologics and then there's ImmuSoft. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=16.52s)]
*  ImmuSoft sits at the nexus point of some of the most innovative approaches in biopharma [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=21.56s)]
*  and their immune system programming platform is unique in its capacity to address the rare disease MPS. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=27.36s)]
*  I sat down with ImmuSoft CEO Sean Ainsworth this week to learn more about his journey in biotechnology, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=34.84s)]
*  the work that ImmuSoft is doing in B cell reprogramming and unpack some of the positive results [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=41.44s)]
*  the company recently shared at the World Symposium. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=47.2s)]
*  Sean explains the challenges of developing therapies for rare disease and why they're planned for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=50.68s)]
*  re-dosing their number one patient at a higher dose is going to be a critical moment, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=55.6s)]
*  not just for the company but for cell and gene therapy generally. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=60.08s)]
*  Enjoy my discussion with Sean Ainsworth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=64.12s)]
*  Sean Ainsworth, thank you for joining us today on Beyond Biotech. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=68.76s)]
*  My pleasure. Thank you for having me on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=73.36s)]
*  We'd love to really get a little bit of an introduction here about your early career in microbiology [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=75.2s)]
*  and try and understand what really sparked your interest in biotechnology to start with. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=81.12s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, I've always been interested in biology from my earliest days in school. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  So it was a natural course for me to go in undergrad. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=93.92s)]
*  And so right out of undergrad at UCS&T, I started at a biotech in San Diego [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=98.48s)]
*  and we were working on stem cells and looking to effect proliferation of stem cells without differentiation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=105.68s)]
*  So these were core blood cells and we were genetically modifying them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=114.88s)]
*  And it was really a cool program for me to work on straight out of undergrad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=119.76s)]
*  Got a lot of experience with many of the techniques that are still in use today from tissue culture to PCR, etc. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=125.36s)]
*  So, yeah, it was super interesting for me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=135.36s)]
*  But, you know, at some point I came to the realization that, you know, I didn't want to do science forever. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  And so I took a segue between business school and the lab. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=149.08s)]
*  And I lived and worked in Japan for a little bit, worked in an intellectual property law office in Japan. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=155.0s)]
*  And so from there came back to the US, went to business school and got into corporate development consulting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=162.88s)]
*  And that was largely partnering between US and Japanese pharmas and biotech. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=172.32s)]
*  So really, you know, the veritable sip from a fire hose type of job for me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=177.16s)]
*  But, you know, really learned a ton in that experience and moved from there into more into the business side. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=183.48s)]
*  But I'll hit the pause button. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=193.0s)]
*  You asked about my early days in biotech, but I went a little beyond that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=194.76s)]
*  So when you when you jumped into business, you've actually founded a couple of biotech companies along the way. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  We're talking RetroSense and Compendia Bioscience. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  What drove you to to take the entrepreneurial side of biotechnology by the scruff of the neck? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=209.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, great question. Thanks. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=215.52s)]
*  As mentioned, I was I was consulting at a St. Louis consultancy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=217.88s)]
*  It was it was called Mets and Jack Group at the time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=222.16s)]
*  It is now Kent R Health. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=224.84s)]
*  I really enjoyed that work. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=227.04s)]
*  But at the time, actually, I was engaged a bit of a long story. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=230.4s)]
*  But my wife moved to Michigan. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=235.88s)]
*  She was my fiance at the time, and I decided to take the plunge on the entrepreneurial side and moved to Michigan. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=238.84s)]
*  And that's where I discovered the work that ultimately led to Compendia Bioscience. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=244.8s)]
*  So helped co-found that company, get it off the ground. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=250.4s)]
*  And so, yeah, that was ultimately acquired by life technology. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=256.48s)]
*  So great, you know, early success and really just a phenomenal experience in and of itself. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=260.64s)]
*  We had that experience. You also had RetroSense, which was acquired by Allergan, I think, acquired by Allergan. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=268.88s)]
*  Indeed. Correct. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=275.56s)]
*  Did that shape how you're moving within yourself now to move towards exits, move towards acquisitions? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=276.64s)]
*  So, indeed, indeed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=284.8s)]
*  So let me maybe take a step back real quick and just say from the technology perspective that absolutely shaped what we're doing at ImmySoft and why I joined ImmySoft. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  So, yeah, RetroSense was an ocular gene therapy company. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  And if I can go back to my days in consulting and partnering between US and Japanese companies, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  there was kind of a dogma that you wouldn't recommend any gene therapies to anybody. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=313.52s)]
*  So this is going back into the early aughts. And so gene therapies were absolutely just not in favor. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=320.2s)]
*  When I started the work at RetroSense, that was always in the back of my mind and a question mark. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=327.56s)]
*  But I really appreciated the eye as a initial place to go with a gene therapeutic for many reasons. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=335.56s)]
*  And in fact, the first gene replacement therapy in the US was an ocular gene therapy, Luxterna. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=346.36s)]
*  So pardon me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=353.64s)]
*  So we did get acquired by Allergan. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=356.72s)]
*  And as I was at Allergan and helping to transition the technology over, I knew that I wasn't going to end up there forever. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  I started looking at opportunities to move into cell and gene therapies outside of the eye. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=370.76s)]
*  So once you move outside of the eye, things get pretty tricky really fast. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=377.08s)]
*  And so I was introduced to ImmuSoft and really appreciated the elegance of the approach that obviates the need for things like [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=382.84s)]
*  immunosuppression, myeloablation, and gives us the potential, I'll say, to go back and redose patients. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=394.64s)]
*  So and so in terms of the acquisition by Allergan of RetroSense, I think just kind of at the core of biotech and VC backed startups, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=404.6s)]
*  there's always I think part of the understanding is that you'll be working towards a liquidity event. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=419.92s)]
*  In other words, an event in which the investors will be able to actually realize investment capital from their investments that they've put into the company. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=431.12s)]
*  So typically IPO or acquisition, my first two were acquisitions. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=444.12s)]
*  Was there someone along the way, an influence or a mentor, someone who influenced you to go back into leading these companies and go back to lead a company like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=452.28s)]
*  ImmuSoft? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=460.92s)]
*  So I wouldn't necessarily say it was one person in particular, but the ecosystem here in Michigan is something that they've been working on for a long time to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=463.88s)]
*  develop a better ecosystem for startups. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  And so I found myself in that ecosystem when I moved to the state. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think it was a confluence of many people kind of pushing in that direction. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=487.36s)]
*  And I probably took cues from a lot of people. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=493.04s)]
*  And so it's really been an exciting ride here. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=497.88s)]
*  In different industries as well, I imagine from the startup community, we're talking not just biotech. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=501.96s)]
*  So within the state, yeah, there's a lot of advanced manufacturing, alternative energy, etc. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=509.32s)]
*  So yeah, a lot in the biotech, pardon me, in the startup ecosystem. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=516.92s)]
*  Let's turn to ImmuSoft now. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=523.8399999999999s)]
*  For listeners who are new to ImmuSoft, how would you describe the core mission in a sentence or two? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=525.68s)]
*  How do we put it all together? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=531.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So we're developing B cells as a modality for therapeutic protein delivery and a modality that enables us to safely deliver these [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=534.16s)]
*  therapeutic proteins in the circulation and in a way that obviates some of the college shortcomings of virus delivery, stem cell delivery. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=546.68s)]
*  And so, yes, we've advanced into the clinic and really excited about what we're seeing there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  Can you actually maybe walk us through how that reprogramming of the B cells works? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=568.0s)]
*  Why is it different? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=573.24s)]
*  Sure. So it starts with the fact that B cells are really extraordinary biofactories. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=575.64s)]
*  So when we talk about B cells, we sometimes use the word plasma cell and B cell interchangeably. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=588.12s)]
*  But the plasma cell is really the workhorse of our approach. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=597.48s)]
*  And these are cells that respond to antigens. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=601.72s)]
*  So you can think of a virus or a COVID vaccine, something of that nature. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=605.92s)]
*  It drives these cells to respond and then produce thousands of antibodies per second. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=612.04s)]
*  And they naturally migrate to and engraft in the bone marrow. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=618.32s)]
*  And once they're engrafted in the bone marrow, they can last many years, potentially decades, producing these proteins in the case of a vaccine or a virus [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=623.52s)]
*  producing that antibody to the tune of thousands per second over potentially decades. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=635.08s)]
*  So the two key things here is, one, we program those B cells to produce therapeutic proteins. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  And then we, outside of the body, ex vivo, we differentiate them towards that plasma cell state. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=651.36s)]
*  And that's what we ultimately deliver back to the patient. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=658.12s)]
*  And we've actually now seen proof positive that those cells do go to and engraft in the bone marrow, which is super exciting. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  And we're a bit over a year out now from our first patient. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=670.92s)]
*  But the expectation is those cells will stick around and produce that therapeutic protein for many, many years, potentially decades. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=675.64s)]
*  If I can add one more comment to that effect, I talked earlier about not requiring immunosuppression, not requiring myeloablation. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=686.5200000000001s)]
*  So myeloablation, just to explain, is if we think about a bone marrow transplant, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=699.44s)]
*  there's a need to essentially remove the existing bone marrow to make room for that transplant. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty toxic, not very well tolerated by these patients. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=714.28s)]
*  And it can lead to death. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=720.72s)]
*  And so that we avoid that altogether is hugely important. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=723.44s)]
*  And then on the topic of immunosuppression, when we deliver viruses, we deliver gene therapeutics by viruses. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=729.88s)]
*  Or I should say when other groups deliver gene therapeutics by virus modalities, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=739.6s)]
*  there is a pretty significant hyperimmune response to that vector, as one might imagine. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=745.08s)]
*  So that actually can be pretty toxic initially. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=753.36s)]
*  And in some cases, it does lead to death as well. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=759.28s)]
*  So we've been delivering our B cells without the need for either of those modalities, those regimens. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=763.28s)]
*  And we've demonstrated a really clean safety profile thus far. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=771.4s)]
*  I'm super excited about that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=777.28s)]
*  And on top of that, we've actually seen pretty compelling early signs of activity in these patients. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=779.64s)]
*  What sort of diseases are best suited for this platform? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=788.4s)]
*  And I guess the second part of that is what are you deciding? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  How do you decide what to prioritize? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=794.6s)]
*  Great. Yeah, excellent question. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=798.32s)]
*  So, you know, at a high level, we believe that if we can, you know, if there's a therapeutic protein delivered systemically, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=799.88s)]
*  that's a candidate to be delivered by but from B cells. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=813.04s)]
*  So we could conceptually program the B cells to deliver that therapeutic protein. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=817.04s)]
*  We've started with lysosomal storage diseases for a couple of key reasons. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=823.08s)]
*  One is that they're genetically defined. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=829.48s)]
*  And so what that means is there's not this mystery as to how we target the disease, what protein we need to deliver and so forth. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=832.76s)]
*  So having a genetically defined indication is very, very helpful in the development pathway. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=841.84s)]
*  There's also quite significant on that need. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=851.48s)]
*  And so, you know, in the case of MPS1, it gets a little complicated as to the standard of care. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=855.48s)]
*  But there is an enzyme replacement therapy that is on the market. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=862.36s)]
*  And it has absolutely positively impacted these patients. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=868.36s)]
*  However, you know, it's not curative. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=874.76s)]
*  It does require weekly infusions and four hours at a time and doesn't fully address all of the manifestations of the disease. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  So we think that there is, you know, a lot of room for a new entry into the space. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  I guess when you're developing a technology in a platform like this, you've got to run into some technical problems. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=895.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just the nature of the beast. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=902.92s)]
*  Can you tell me maybe about one that you ran into and how you solved or how you're currently addressing that? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=905.16s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, you know, I think the key to any advanced therapeutic like this is it's all about manufacturing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=913.0s)]
*  So and there's no silver bullet. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=922.72s)]
*  It's a function of continuous improvement, you know, really bringing in the experts first and foremost to get, you know, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=926.32s)]
*  get things moving forward and then continuously improving. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=934.6s)]
*  And so we've, you know, we've done that. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=938.1600000000001s)]
*  We've put a lot of resources and time, thought, energy into the manufacturing of these programs. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=941.2s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's really paying off for us. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=949.68s)]
*  I'm going to ask you to drill down now into something you just mentioned a minute ago, which was MPS1. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=953.92s)]
*  Now, that's a rare disease. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=958.68s)]
*  Like you said, it's really tough to treat. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=961.28s)]
*  Can you give a little bit of a background about the patient load there? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=963.16s)]
*  How many people are we talking about and what sort of symptoms are they experiencing that you're trying to address? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=966.5999999999999s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. So pardon me. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=974.12s)]
*  At a high level, this is a disease that is characterized by the by the loss of or deficiency of an enzyme. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=978.08s)]
*  The enzyme is is known as iDuronidase. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=988.48s)]
*  And so that's what we're programming our B cells to deliver. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=991.5600000000001s)]
*  So that enzyme is involved in the breakdown of long chain sugars known as glycosaminoglycans or GAGs for short. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=996.44s)]
*  And so when those glycosaminoglycans build up, they get they're not broken down by that enzyme. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1006.12s)]
*  They build up in the lysosomes within the cells. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1014.16s)]
*  And so they're they're toxic at the cellular level and by extension through the tissues, organs, organ systems. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1017.12s)]
*  They they have manifestations in the in the brain and the bones in the liver, spleen, really throughout the body, the muscles. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1024.56s)]
*  And so. If untreated, you know, that these these patients with the most severe form of the of the disease don't typically live through childhood. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  So thankfully, we do have treatment approaches and, you know, we're working to build on that and improve at this point now at Emisoft. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1047.6s)]
*  And ideally, you're going to improve over what's currently out there. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1058.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe you can explain what what your candidate does for the patients that they're not getting from these existing treatments. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1063.44s)]
*  So, yeah, excellent, excellent question, Joachim. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. So the let me let me start by saying, you know, we've we've dosed a couple of patients. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1076.24s)]
*  So I think we are absolutely encouraged by what we are seeing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1083.52s)]
*  And so that includes biomarkers that indicate, you know, our our B cells are delivering the protein as expected and it's functioning as expected. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1090.6399999999999s)]
*  We've also positively identified those B cells within the bone marrow of, you know, of that initial patient so far, which is which is super exciting. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1102.52s)]
*  It really closes the loop on how we are getting to the to the outcomes we're seeing. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1113.0s)]
*  Beyond that, you know, we've seen functional improvements that have completely exceeded our expectations. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1119.08s)]
*  So that's for two reasons. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1128.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, we started out with a very low dose that, you know, we'd hoped to see some activity. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1132.08s)]
*  We've seen, you know, to date, a 240 meter improvement in a six minute walk test. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1139.32s)]
*  So for the American audience, that's roughly three football fields. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1146.36s)]
*  Pretty, you know, pretty significant over, you know, over six minutes. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1151.12s)]
*  We've seen improvements in shoulder flexion. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  And so that's an indicator that, you know, that that there's there's greater flexibility throughout the body. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1158.76s)]
*  The patient is reported being in less pain and taking less pain meds. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1167.08s)]
*  These are these are all hugely important indicators that we are, you know, having a positive effect in the clinic. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1172.76s)]
*  Was this some of the data that you shared at and results you shared at World Symposium? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1182.6000000000001s)]
*  These were the sorts of things you were talking about there, right? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1187.88s)]
*  Indeed, indeed, exactly. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  So our PI principal investigator, Paul Orchard at University of Minnesota presented the data. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1193.0s)]
*  And so it was very well received. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1200.84s)]
*  I was there. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1205.56s)]
*  It was the very last day of the conference. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1208.08s)]
*  So I wasn't sure how many people would actually show up. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1210.08s)]
*  But, you know, it was a pretty full room and a lot of interest around what we're doing. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1213.28s)]
*  So that was that was very exciting. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1219.8s)]
*  And I guess I should ask what comes next for the trial, then, because as I understand it, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1223.28s)]
*  you're going to try redosing patient number one. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1228.24s)]
*  What's the expectation there? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1231.44s)]
*  What's the hope? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes, indeed, that's what we're working towards. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1235.36s)]
*  And so, pardon me, we are looking to actually increase the dose and, you know, while reducing the patient. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1239.2s)]
*  And the expectation is that, you know, over time, we can take the patient off of enzyme replacement therapy entirely. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1250.68s)]
*  And so that's that's that's what we're working towards. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1260.5200000000002s)]
*  That having been said, I think, you know, having a patient redosing a patient in this type of setting, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1265.3200000000002s)]
*  that'll be a watershed moment for cell and gene therapies. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1274.7600000000002s)]
*  Nobody's really doing that in a, you know, in a scenario where you're you're you're over expressing a gene as we are. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1278.12s)]
*  How do you how do you balance the urgency of treating MPS one and the patients with sort of the need for really rigorous clinical validation? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1286.04s)]
*  I mean, these patients are going through something we would hope nobody goes through. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  And you've got to balance helping those people right now with doing things the right way, the long way, the slow way through the clinic. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1301.72s)]
*  Is that a challenge for your team? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1308.8s)]
*  So, you know, I think that's that's kind of the broader question with clinical trials writ large. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1311.84s)]
*  Right. So I think the FDA has got a very deliberate approach for balancing safety with, you know, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1320.04s)]
*  prospective benefit. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1330.52s)]
*  And so we're, you know, we're we're working with the agency to ensure that, you know, we we we approach this in a way that [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1331.96s)]
*  is compatible with their expectations, but does, you know, bring this this treatment forward as as quickly as safety permits. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1342.04s)]
*  I guess the other thing that comes to mind when when we're dealing with a rare disease [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  is, you know, in terms of trial design, access to patients, how do you how do you work around that? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  Because there there's just so so few of these patients to trial within the first place. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1362.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah, indeed. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  So in an orphan indication such as MPS one, you know, the expectations are not going to be the same as, you know, for example, an obesity trial. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1371.92s)]
*  You can you can conduct much, much smaller clinical trials. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1382.8s)]
*  We've actually been actively working with many of the patient advocacy groups as well to, you know, to get the word out there. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  Dr. Orchard again, presenting at at World Symposium in February was a great way to get the word out there. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1398.6s)]
*  And so, you know, there's this kind of organic [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1406.04s)]
*  growth of interest in what we're doing. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1411.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, we've we've got patients that are coming to us and expressing interest in joining the trial, which which certainly makes things much easier. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1414.04s)]
*  And in terms of partnerships, and are you partnering with any particular hospitals or even pharma companies to help drive this forward? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1424.24s)]
*  So, yeah, we, you know, I mentioned University of Minnesota, Paul Orchard. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1432.44s)]
*  We also have a clinical trial site at UC San Francisco. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1437.04s)]
*  That's Dr. Paul Harmatz. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1442.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, likewise, one of the key opinion leaders in the space. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1445.3200000000002s)]
*  He's been doing clinical trials in MPS for for decades. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1448.64s)]
*  Great group to work with. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1452.76s)]
*  And so we've we've recently brought them online and we're looking forward to getting, you know, some patients in. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1454.1200000000001s)]
*  And at UCSF as well. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1460.52s)]
*  You know, one of the one of the things that comes to mind when I hear you talking about the therapy and the approach is you sort of seem to sit at that intersection between cell therapy, gene therapy, biologics. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1465.32s)]
*  Where do you actually see yourself as sitting in as fitting into this group? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1478.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1484.36s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1485.8000000000002s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I look at these as gene therapies there. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1486.72s)]
*  We've got either a virus delivered or gene modified stem cells. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1491.72s)]
*  So, yes, you're entirely correct. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1496.96s)]
*  We're we're a little in between, you know, a few different approaches. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1501.64s)]
*  So we're the broader field being advanced therapeutics, cell and gene therapies right in that in that space. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1505.44s)]
*  I guess because we we hear a lot of excitement around mRNA around CRISPR, you know, where does B cell reprogramming fit in? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1514.72s)]
*  Is this the next big thing or is it always going to sit next to it as a specialized approach? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1524.8s)]
*  So, yeah, that's an interesting question. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1532.2s)]
*  I think that the B cell approach, you know, if we think of CAR T, I think we're kind of [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1536.04s)]
*  there are many analogues to what's what's going on in the CAR T space, right? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1543.44s)]
*  We've got a defined cell population. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1546.8400000000001s)]
*  It can be modified by different approaches, including CRISPR. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1549.64s)]
*  We use a transposon system. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1554.56s)]
*  And so, you know, I think of it as a specialized cellular approach. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1558.24s)]
*  And are there other disease groups or therapeutic areas where you can see this reprogramming coming in and playing a role? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1565.56s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1573.72s)]
*  So there's, you know, potentially dozens of therapeutic indications that we could pursue with with the reprogramming of B cells. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1575.28s)]
*  You know, as mentioned earlier, if we can deliver a therapeutic protein into the circulation, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1586.84s)]
*  then there's potential application with with gene modified stem cells. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1594.08s)]
*  So a couple of programs that we're working on real time are a Parkinson's program, which we're, you know, super excited about. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1598.2399999999998s)]
*  We've also [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1607.56s)]
*  are working with a group, an academic consortium on an art by age grant to deploy GLPs. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1610.0s)]
*  And so that's, you know, that's exciting work as well. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1620.0s)]
*  And, you know, there are other projects we've got ongoing that include antibody approaches and oncology, autoimmune. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1623.1999999999998s)]
*  So a lot of [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1633.0s)]
*  big potential applications of gene modified B cells. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1635.7199999999998s)]
*  You mentioned back at the start of a discussion here that one of the big challenges was was manufacturing and manufacturing was always going to be a big challenge. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1640.52s)]
*  I guess with rare diseases, manufacturing scalability, but also funding, funding for this sort of research. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1649.1599999999999s)]
*  These are all challenges to face. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1656.52s)]
*  You know, what's your what's your take on how the industry can do more to support rare disease scaling with these therapies, a little bit more funding and to help solve that manufacturing problem? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1658.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1671.56s)]
*  So I think I should start out by acknowledging and thinking CIRM, California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1672.96s)]
*  So they've been very active and supportive, both financially as well as with [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1681.12s)]
*  personnel and resources. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1687.96s)]
*  And they recognize that, you know, manufacturing is something that that ultimately needs to be supported as well. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1689.48s)]
*  There have been probably too many examples of brilliant therapeutics that looked promising, but ultimately couldn't be manufactured at scale. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1697.88s)]
*  So, yeah, we've got an outstanding support from CIRM. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1706.5200000000002s)]
*  Pardon me. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1711.8000000000002s)]
*  I think that, you know, the the industry has evolved now to a point where it's understood that, you know, there needs to be investment in manufacturing. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1713.48s)]
*  That having been said, you know, we've really been also focusing on scalability. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1724.32s)]
*  I mentioned that, you know, we use a transposon system and so that it's a naked DNA plasmid. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1730.12s)]
*  And so from a manufacturing standpoint, that's much more tenable than virus vectors. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1738.24s)]
*  Having worked in both worlds, you know, I think that I'll take a few more examples. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1745.28s)]
*  You know, I think that I'll take transposons 100 times out of 100 over overworking with virus. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1752.04s)]
*  So we also, you know, our culture system is quite short, seven days. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1759.56s)]
*  And that's that's where a lot of the costs can come in, is in the culture system. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1766.56s)]
*  That's the human hours. Right. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1773.84s)]
*  So saving that back to a week is a big advantage for us. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1776.6s)]
*  And then a minor item, but important is in the case of MPS one, if we contrast that with oncology where CAR-Ts are being deployed in oncology, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1782.44s)]
*  there's a very immediate need to get those cells turned around and back to the patients. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1796.24s)]
*  And so, pardon me, without we don't have quite that same urgency. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1803.04s)]
*  And so that leads to some streamlining of operations that we can realize. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1809.4s)]
*  So in terms of scalability, we think that ultimately at commercial scale will be roughly the same ballpark as gene modified, pardon me, as AAV delivered gene therapeutics. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1815.76s)]
*  I've got a final couple of questions here for you in terms of the horizon. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1831.76s)]
*  What's coming next? If we can look maybe short term first in the next 12 to 18 months, what are we going to see from you, Mr. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1835.16s)]
*  Sof? What are you going to be achieving in the next 18 months? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1842.24s)]
*  So, yeah, thank you. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1848.0s)]
*  We, of course, continuing forward with the MPS one clinical trial. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1850.28s)]
*  So we expect to get some data readouts over the course of the next three to six months, which we're we're really excited about. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1854.56s)]
*  That also includes potentially reducing our first patient again, watershed moment for cell and gene therapeutics. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1864.84s)]
*  MPS two is our follow on program. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1873.8s)]
*  And we've been working with the FDA towards bringing that into the clinic. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1877.08s)]
*  And I can't go into exquisite detail, but it appears we're actually going to benefit from some of the work that we've already done with MPS one, which could streamline that that clinical program. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  And from there, we're continuing forward with I mentioned our Perkinsons program, which we're quite excited about. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1898.56s)]
*  We've had you asked earlier about potential partnerships with industry. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1907.2s)]
*  You know, we've had some really interesting conversations on with potential partners as well. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1912.84s)]
*  So a lot of really exciting things coming up over the next couple of next few months to to a year here. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1918.28s)]
*  It all sounds exciting. And if I can just push you towards a bigger horizon, if we talk in terms of five or ten years, it's hard to say exactly where where you'll be. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1926.96s)]
*  Or what the result of a trial is. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1937.12s)]
*  But do you have in mind the sort of advance or the sort of contribution to medicine and therapeutics that you hope in yourself is going to be able to deliver in that five to ten year horizon? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1938.84s)]
*  So. Well, I'm going to I'm going to make a bold statement and say that, you know, I think if as people catch on and realize that we're able to deliver these gene, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1951.64s)]
*  these genes as safely as so far we've been able to do, you know, we could potentially supplant a lot of what is going on at present in [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1964.68s)]
*  virus delivery in gene modified stem cells. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1975.8s)]
*  So and ultimately, that's why I got into this is to try to develop a better approach that's safer and and still delivers that kind of efficacy that so many of these patients need. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u37maO4rqqM&t=1978.84s)]
