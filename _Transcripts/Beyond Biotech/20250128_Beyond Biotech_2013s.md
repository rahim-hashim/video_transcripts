Video Description: This week’s podcast is sponsored by Vetter.


On this week’s episode, we have a conversation with Steve Worland, CEO of eFFECTOR Therapeutics.


eFFECTOR is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of a new class of oncology drugs referred to as STRIs (selective translation regulation inhibitors). 


eFFECTOR’s STRI product candidates target the eIF4F complex and its activating kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK). The eIF4F complex is a central node where two of the most frequently mutated signaling pathways in cancer, the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways, converge to activate the translation of select mRNA into proteins that are frequent culprits in key disease-driving processes. 


The company’s product candidates are designed to act on a single protein that drives the expression of a network of functionally related proteins, including oncoproteins and immunosuppressive proteins in T cells, that together control tumor growth, survival and immune evasion. 


The lead product candidate, tomivosertib, is an MNK inhibitor currently being evaluated in KICKSTART, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial of tomivosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 


Zotatifin, eFFECTOR’s inhibitor of eIF4A, is currently being evaluated in phase 2a expansion cohorts in certain biomarker-positive solid tumors, including ER+ breast cancer and KRAS-mutant NSCLC. 

eFFECTOR has a global collaboration with Pfizer to develop inhibitors of a third target, eIF4E.

# Beyond Biotech podcast 63 – Tackling cancer with STRIs
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech Podcast number 63. I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly LeBioTech podcast. This podcast is sponsored by Vetter, a globally leading contract [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=15.08s)]
*  development and manufacturing organisation with over 70 years of experience as a responsible [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=22.6s)]
*  independent family business. Driven by more than 6,000 employees worldwide, we provide, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=28.08s)]
*  together with our customers, life-saving injectable drug products to the patients [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=34.04s)]
*  that rely on them most. We partner with our customers from phase one through market launch [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=38.68s)]
*  and beyond, supporting them with our versatile services, highest possible quality standards, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=44.2s)]
*  and innovative production technologies. For more information, visit us at Vetter-Pharma.com. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=50.0s)]
*  So what's been happening this week? Well, not much really. A little bit of planning because [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  events have started up again after the summer and so I'm sure there are plenty of you out there [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=64.08s)]
*  putting itineraries together for various trips. It's funny how in the spring I ended up going to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=68.72s)]
*  Liverpool twice in a week and the last time I was there was 1984. Similarly, the last time I was in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=75.52s)]
*  Munich was 1983 and it looks like I'll be there twice in November. I'm sure it hasn't changed a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=82.36s)]
*  bit in 40 years. Not that I can really remember that much about it anyway. And so today's podcast [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=88.84s)]
*  number 63 goes out on September the 15th, although of course you may be listening to this after it [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=95.16s)]
*  was published. It's not like live radio, which I do miss, I must say. So September the 15th is Green [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=101.56s)]
*  Peace Day, Caregivers Day, Cheese on Toast Day, Tackle Kids Cancer Day and Eight Track Tape Day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=109.08s)]
*  I was wondering exactly what you would do with that one. No one has an eight track player anymore, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=117.16s)]
*  do they? I remember, and this is going to make me feel really old, but my first ever ride in a car [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=122.36s)]
*  it had an eight track in it. It was boxing day and my then brother-in-law took me in his Ford Capri [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=127.96s)]
*  to get petrol or gas and he was playing in Gordon Lightfoot's band at the time and when I got in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=133.96s)]
*  car Sundown was playing. Funny how you remember some things from your childhood but I have no [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=139.8s)]
*  idea what I did yesterday. In science it's the day a patent was filed for saccharin and also the day [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  the first weather balloon was launched. It's the day the first railway was opened in the UK and it's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=152.12s)]
*  also the day of the first railway fatality because it happened at the same event. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=158.2s)]
*  And it's also the day that the term bacteriophage was used for the first time, at least as far as [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  we know. The person who coined the phrase in 1917, Dr Felix Derrell, might have mentioned it to his [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=170.44s)]
*  wife the day before, or maybe she suggested it. Regardless, let's move on to today's podcast, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  which doesn't involve bacteriophages. Cancer dysregulation affects a large network of cellular [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=183.72s)]
*  signaling pathways resulting in tumor progression. The complexity of these pathways limits the long [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=190.44s)]
*  term benefits of therapies and that often results in resistance and adverse effects that can [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  significantly affect patients quality of life. To tackle this challenge, Effector Therapeutics [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=202.6s)]
*  is spearheading a novel approach to targeted therapies by depriving cancer cells of essential [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=209.56s)]
*  proteins. They use small molecule selective translation regulation inhibitors, also known [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  as STRIs, to selectively prevent the overproduction and critical cancer causing proteins, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=222.2s)]
*  which are activated by highly validated cancer pathways. To explain it all to us much better than [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  I ever could is Effector Therapeutics CEO Steve Worland. All right, so I guess to get things [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=235.24s)]
*  rolling, I wonder if you could first give me a little bit of background on the company. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=242.84s)]
*  Yeah, sure. The company is called Effector Therapeutics. We were founded 11 years ago [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=247.96s)]
*  using technology out of UCSS. Our academic founder is a Kavon Shokat, who's quite a prolific company [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=252.84s)]
*  starter and his colleague, Davide Rogero. We had an idea, the three of us really, about how to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=259.4s)]
*  regulate production and stop the overproduction of certain proteins that are essential for cancers [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=266.44s)]
*  to grow. That was sort of the start of the company. We invented three different candidates that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=272.35999999999996s)]
*  hopefully will become products that are currently in development to treat different types of tumors [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=279.56s)]
*  and are busy working on two of those. The third one, we did a licensing deal with Pfizer on that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=284.2s)]
*  one. You said UCSF and yet you're in San Diego. Yeah, well, so I had a team here in San Diego that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=289.32s)]
*  we were kind of looking for our next thing. I'd run a company and sold that company to Roche in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=297.4s)]
*  2011 and was looking for kind of what to do next, particularly in cancer. I was fairly agnostic to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=302.52s)]
*  where the academic science came from, so I actually went around the country. I went to all the top [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=309.32s)]
*  notch academic universities on the East Coast and the West Coast looking for the most exciting thing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=313.4s)]
*  I could find and it happened to be at UCSF. I didn't actually know the founders before we started [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=318.76s)]
*  talking, but we very quickly kind of knew that the team I had here in San Diego and what they [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=324.44s)]
*  were working on was going to be a good match. And so we came together and formed the company. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=328.84s)]
*  What are some of the challenges in tackling cancer that you're trying to address? Because clearly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=334.36s)]
*  there were so many different forms of cancer and so many challenges involved. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=339.08s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's really spot on with why we started the company. The real challenge that I [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=344.52s)]
*  saw was the complexity of cancer. And you mentioned there are several different kinds of cancer, even [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=350.44s)]
*  within what we would call one type of cancer. There's quite a bit of genetic diversity and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=355.72s)]
*  what we call plasticity, meaning the cancer can really morph back and forth. If you think about [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=361.24s)]
*  a treatment as kind of putting pressure on the cancer, it can kind of dodge and go a different [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=367.24s)]
*  direction. I'd spent about 10 years working mostly in the antiviral area. So first, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=372.2s)]
*  way back in my career, I worked on everything as a generalist, including cancer. Then I focused on [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=377.8s)]
*  antivirals, first HIV and then hepatitis C. And the real answer to both of those diseases was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  you've got to play chess with the disease, anticipate what the disease will do. I hit [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=389.88s)]
*  this target, it's going to evolve, it's going to mutate, it's going to do that. If I hit this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=394.6s)]
*  target, then that target, then that target, you could begin to actually see what in chess they [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=398.12s)]
*  call the game tree. You could see how the disease will respond to one type of therapy and how could [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  I complement that and kind of box it into a corner. I'd say in HIV, we at least box it into a corner. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=407.72s)]
*  Now there's long-term, relatively effective care and hepatitis C for 95% of patients, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=413.72s)]
*  we beat the disease. Most patients, almost all patients, you can eradicate what was a chronic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=419.96s)]
*  viral infection. And the thinking here was really how is the disease going to respond [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=424.76s)]
*  to our therapy? So now you have to amp the complexity up by a factor of 10, maybe more, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=429.0s)]
*  maybe a factor of 50 for cancer. But that same idea that there were some remarkable successes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  in cancer, targeted therapies like LVAC and Herceptin. And then when people tried to take [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=441.56s)]
*  those concepts to other types of tumors, they found resistance developed quite quickly for most [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=447.24s)]
*  what we call targeted therapy. And so our thinking was, okay, let's acknowledge that's part of the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=452.2s)]
*  disease. It is very complex. It's very agile and can squirm out from under our treatment. So let's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=456.92s)]
*  anticipate that and let's think about our therapy. And so fundamentally that was the issue with the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=462.76s)]
*  complexity that leads to resistance developing to therapy. How can we anticipate that ahead of time? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  And we were really looking for a way to try to address that complexity. And so because the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=475.0s)]
*  complexity of the cancer allows or enables the cancer to evolve and develop resistance to one [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=480.52s)]
*  type of therapy. And so one of the ways it does that is to rely on several different factors. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=487.0s)]
*  And so going back to starting the company, the idea was to block the overproduction of several [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  factors at the same time. And therefore I'll never say we eliminate the possibility of resistance, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=498.68s)]
*  but at least slow it down and make it harder for the cancer to develop resistance. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=505.4s)]
*  And maybe you can, the immune system can kick in and actually eradicate the tumor, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=510.84s)]
*  but at a minimum try to extend the benefit much longer time that people can treat the cancer or [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=514.68s)]
*  experience the cancer as a long-term chronic treatable disease instead of a short-term death [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=520.76s)]
*  sentence. Could you maybe explain a little bit about the role of proteins in cancer and how you [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=525.16s)]
*  describe cancer cells of those essential proteins and sort of what STRIs are and how they work? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=533.64s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. So let's start with a couple of basic ideas. So DNA of course is the kind of the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  code of life. And so people now know that we sequenced the human genome about 20 years ago now [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=547.48s)]
*  and did viruses and bacteria before that. So that's DNA. And I think everybody knows about [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=552.76s)]
*  protein and the protein that we eat. It turns out proteins are the workhorses inside a cell. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=558.2s)]
*  Most of the functions that a cell has to carry out are executed by specific proteins. And these [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  would be things like hemoglobin or trying to think of protein, someone might've heard of it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=570.76s)]
*  Hemoglobin carries oxygen around in your blood. You think about a protein like an insulin receptor [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=575.88s)]
*  recognizes insulin and tells cells what to do with the sugar molecules. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  So DNA again code of life protein, the workhorses in the cell in between those two is another species [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=586.84s)]
*  called RNA. So RNA is related to DNA, but with a slight chemical difference. And so the information [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  in the DNA is read or we say transcribed into the RNA. And then the information in the RNA is then [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=598.84s)]
*  translated into a protein sequence. And so we're working on that second step called translation, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=606.28s)]
*  which is basically taking the information in the genome that's been rewritten as RNA and then [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=611.72s)]
*  reading that into a directions to a factory inside a cell to make proteins. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=618.2s)]
*  I'll give you just a little bit of history. So when I started moving into molecular biology now, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=623.24s)]
*  my goodness, 40 years ago, transcription was the hot thing. Everybody thought, oh, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  we've understood gene expression and all the action happens at transcription making RNA. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=631.72s)]
*  And translation is kind of boring. Everybody's known about that. That's how you make the protein. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=637.24s)]
*  That's housekeeping function. And for 95% of the proteins in a cell, that's true. All the actions [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=640.92s)]
*  at transcription, once the cell has taken the steps to transcribe the DNA, the protein is going [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  to get made. But there's a very small set of proteins. And these are important proteins that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  really have a profound effect on the cell's behavior. There's a second set of instructions [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=657.4s)]
*  that needs to be read. There's a second sort of gate you have to get over called translation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=662.76s)]
*  And the cell has evolved so that those proteins only get made if there's specific conditions [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  where those proteins should be made. And again, that's because these proteins drive cells to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  divide and they drive cells to migrate to other parts of the body, both of which are central to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=678.52s)]
*  cancer. And what cancer cleverly has done is sort of hijack that translation function. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=683.56s)]
*  And it's continually making these many proteins that allow cells to divide. It allows cells to [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=689.7199999999999s)]
*  avoid cell death, which is a natural thing that a cancer cell should go kill itself. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=695.56s)]
*  Cancer will override that signal, allow cells to start migrating to other parts of the body, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=699.7199999999999s)]
*  which create metastasis. So cancer has perpetually upregulated this overproduction of proteins. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  And what our molecules do, our STRIs, they actually intervene there and stop cancer cells from [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  exploiting that overproduction mechanism. And we can tamp it back down. We actually don't shut [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=717.56s)]
*  off production entirely. That would be more like a toxochemotherapy. What we do is just work on [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=722.04s)]
*  that overproduction and that last little bit that lets a normal cell become a cancer cell. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=727.0s)]
*  We block that part of translation and then the tumor can't grow and the tumor can't avoid its [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=731.9599999999999s)]
*  own death signals. How does this work in terms of the way that it's delivered to the body? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=738.52s)]
*  Yeah, so we have two different product candidates now in clinical development. One of them is a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=747.16s)]
*  small oral pill. And so you would swallow that twice a day. You take it with your meals, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=751.4s)]
*  sort of breakfast and dinner kind of thing. And that product candidate now is in what we call [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=756.28s)]
*  phase 2B. So it's in a randomized study against placebo. The other one is an IV product. And so [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=762.92s)]
*  that's delivered over about 45 minutes. Right now we're looking at once every two weeks. So [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=768.76s)]
*  not too inconvenient there. If you can take a week off and then come back in and relatively [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=774.04s)]
*  short infusion time. That's not like an eight hour kind of chemotherapy or something. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=779.4799999999999s)]
*  And so that one's delivered by IV. And then both of them very quickly distribute throughout the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=783.88s)]
*  whole body and of course get taken up by the tumor cells and have their effect inside the tumor cells. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=787.8s)]
*  Does it need to be repeated or is it once it's done its thing then you're good? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  No, right now we're repeated really until the cancer grows. And so it's very hard to know very [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=799.9599999999999s)]
*  generally when to stop cancer therapy because if it's working, if you block the tumor, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=806.92s)]
*  there are instances where we know the immune system has taken over and you actually can [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=813.56s)]
*  stop therapy because you now have your own immune system, knows your own tumor and can eradicate it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=817.24s)]
*  Those are still quite rare. And so generally cancer therapy is taken for as long as the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=821.88s)]
*  tumor is under control. It's not growing in the patient. Hopefully it's shrunk typically. And for [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=827.4799999999999s)]
*  our drugs as well, people would continue taking these until there's a safety signal, which I'll [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=832.04s)]
*  come back to in a minute or until the tumor unfortunately ultimately becomes resistant [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=836.52s)]
*  and starts growing again. Because it is long-term chronic therapy, the safety profile is very [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=840.4399999999999s)]
*  important as well. And not just straight on like medical safety, but also just the convenience of [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=845.8s)]
*  taking it. And if you're not technically sick, but you feel like crap all the time, you feel [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=849.96s)]
*  nausea, vomiting, that's not good. So we've really tried to make sure that we find doses and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  what we call regimens, how often you take it, that are well tolerated and easy for the patients to [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=861.0799999999999s)]
*  take. Because the big idea here is to let a patient with cancer almost forget they have cancer. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=865.88s)]
*  They're going to have to stay on therapy, but you don't want their therapy to constantly remind [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=870.76s)]
*  them by how horrible they feel taking the therapy that they have cancer. You want them to go on with [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=874.68s)]
*  their life and check in obviously with their doctors periodically, but hopefully keep the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=879.56s)]
*  cancer at bay for a long time and make it more like a chronic treatable disease than a short-term [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=883.64s)]
*  sentence. What kind of cancers is this approach applicable to? Yeah. So I would say [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=890.2s)]
*  probably quite broadly from our understanding and the work we've done to date, we're really focusing [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=896.28s)]
*  on two types of cancers. So for the first product called Tamila Certib, that's the oral pill, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=901.0s)]
*  that one we're focusing on non-small cell lung cancer. And that one we're actually combining [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=907.0s)]
*  with a drug from Merck called Keytruda, which is the best drug in non-small cell lung cancer today. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=912.28s)]
*  And we're combining with that and trying to extend that benefit. And then the second product we call [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=919.64s)]
*  Zotadiphen, or we call it Zota for short, we're testing that in breast cancer right now. So both [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=924.36s)]
*  of these lung cancer and breast cancer, very large patient populations who are suffering from those [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=929.72s)]
*  diseases, very significant death rates from both of those, as breast cancer gets later stage [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=934.6s)]
*  metastatic and lung cancer right off the bat, typically it's already metastatic when it's [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=939.24s)]
*  diagnosed. And so those are the two lung cancer and breast cancer that we're focused on. I do believe [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=943.48s)]
*  with success in those two, we could expand both of the products into other tumor types as well. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=949.4s)]
*  . . . And ultimately, you're mentioning how you want people to be feeling okay and not feeling [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=954.68s)]
*  horrendous about not only the cancer, but the treatment. Is this moving towards [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=962.84s)]
*  curing or just maintaining as a chronic disease that you can maintain for 20 years and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  die of something else, I guess? Yeah. So I think that's one of the critical questions in cancer is, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=977.8s)]
*  could you stop therapy? I think right now the conservative thought is find well tolerated [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=982.52s)]
*  drugs and patients would stay on those drugs. Typically clinical trials don't test for more [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=988.4399999999999s)]
*  than a couple of years, typically. So the FDA labels and European EMA labels would typically say, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=994.28s)]
*  you know, indicate it for two years. But most of the time, physicians and patients don't want to [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1000.28s)]
*  stop the therapy. So, you know, 20 years, of course, is a long, long time. But the idea is [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1007.32s)]
*  probably take it for as long as you can and keep the cancer at bay for as long as possible. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1013.32s)]
*  Ultimately, as the immune system kicks in, there is some hope that patients can sort of educate [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1018.84s)]
*  their own immune system against their tumor and then maybe stop therapy. And if it flares up just [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1023.96s)]
*  a little bit, your immune system can recognize that and eliminate it. There is some evidence for [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1028.76s)]
*  that. But I think that's still early days to think about a fixed treatment and then you can stop and [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1034.2s)]
*  hopefully never have it come back or monitor another intermediate idea to stop the therapy [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1040.44s)]
*  after some period of time, but then monitor periodically. And then if it comes back, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  you can jump back in and treat again. So that may be a step on the way towards true cures where you [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1050.68s)]
*  could walk away and say, I don't need to worry about that again. That would be fantastic to [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1055.48s)]
*  get there. But there's probably an intermediate step on the way to that. You were mentioning at [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1059.48s)]
*  the beginning about the analogy with chess. Is there a danger that in spite of what you're doing [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1063.8s)]
*  that the cancer can adapt and circumvent what you're doing? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1070.76s)]
*  There is. There's always that chance, I think, because of that cancer complexity. So [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1076.84s)]
*  we actually try to anticipate it. That's again part of the disease is, quote, smart as well. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1081.56s)]
*  But trying to anticipate what the tumor might be. So we think a lot about combination therapy. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  Mostly this will be used in combination with other drugs and even understanding how a tumor [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1092.68s)]
*  might become resistant to our drug could suggest another combination we could do. Or one of the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1097.56s)]
*  most important things you can do is kind of as a legacy thing, if our drug treats your cancer and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1103.48s)]
*  then you become resistant, if we understand that resistance, we could suggest what the next therapy [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1108.8400000000001s)]
*  might be as well. Okay. So a different protein has now come up. Unfortunately, we can't control that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1113.8s)]
*  But if there's a drug that could treat that, knowing that ahead of time, they have a patient [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1119.16s)]
*  ready to move on to a different type of therapies. So a lot of what we do is we analyze our successes [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1123.0800000000002s)]
*  in great detail. Why did this patient respond? But we also analyze our failures both upfront. And when [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1129.5600000000002s)]
*  a patient is responding, then becomes resistant. We try to sequence their tumors and you can now [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1135.24s)]
*  sequence tumor cells circulating in blood or tumor DNA actually circulating in blood. So it's very [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1140.44s)]
*  important to have enough realistic view and enough humility to say the cancer is going to try hard [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1146.92s)]
*  to get back at and overcome our drug. How could that happen? And what could we do for that patient [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1152.1200000000001s)]
*  at that point? Could we add on a new drug or switch to a different drug, but have that knowledge [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1157.5600000000002s)]
*  already being part of our understanding early in clinical development? And again, I think that's [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1162.52s)]
*  a lesson we learned very strongly in HIV. And then hepatitis C was a little easier to get rid of, but [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1166.92s)]
*  in HIV, knowing what to do next was one of the critical things early on in therapy where the [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1171.72s)]
*  drugs were working, but they were working for six months or a year. And then what do we do? Okay, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1177.08s)]
*  well then you do this and then you do that. And then ultimately we came up with regimens that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1181.16s)]
*  we pushed that question out, what are we going to do in 10 years, in 15 years? And so that's the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1185.08s)]
*  hope with cancer, that as we understand how the cancer reacts to our drug, we can then begin to [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1189.08s)]
*  push out that time and be ready with the next treatment course as the cancer, if it does become [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1195.08s)]
*  resistant. So it's not just a case of understanding your own product, you also have to understand [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1201.4s)]
*  other products in order to be able to use them together, but also for potential future use. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1209.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I've heard for the last 20 years, this is the best time to be working in cancer. I [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1217.0s)]
*  think that's true every year when somebody new says it, but there's remarkable advances happening [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1222.6000000000001s)]
*  across the industry and across academics and with government sponsorship for basic research [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1227.48s)]
*  and the industrial research that happens. So once a fascinating time to pay attention to [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1233.08s)]
*  how quickly new ideas are coming forward, and then also to think about a more holistic treatment [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1238.3600000000001s)]
*  perspective, we're going to probably come after something. We're probably not going to be [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1244.68s)]
*  the first drug that somebody takes when they get diagnosed with cancer, at least when we would [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1249.32s)]
*  first hopefully get approved, but then also what will come after us. And then understanding that [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1254.04s)]
*  landscape and understanding how the different treatment choices at different stages of cancer, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1259.0s)]
*  how that will change over time, is really critical for doing the best job. And I'll say, it may sound [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1264.36s)]
*  a little corny, but I think we at the company, we feel a responsibility, of course, to the patients [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1270.36s)]
*  and almost to the drugs and to cancer development broadly to do the best job possible. And so to do [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1274.92s)]
*  that, you really need to understand the entire landscape. We fit in part of a very big, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1280.92s)]
*  constantly changing environment of cancer therapy. And to do the best by the patients, meaning [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1285.4s)]
*  offering the best treatment that our drugs could possibly offer to anybody, it's central to that, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  to understand everything that's going on in therapy. And so that's both very fun to have [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1296.6000000000001s)]
*  that continuing learning, but also very important for kind of doing right by the patient and doing [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1302.04s)]
*  right by the drugs that we've invented. Because of all of the developments and advances and [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  every year there's something new. Does that make it challenging for clinical trial design, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1312.4399999999998s)]
*  if there's so many different things going on? It does, Jim, and a couple of levels. And so there [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1319.32s)]
*  are a lot of treatments being tested, especially in lung cancer, because that's such a big disease. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1325.24s)]
*  And even the best therapies today, you know, on average give maybe, you know, six to nine months [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1330.84s)]
*  of good control. And then on average, resistance starts developing again. But because of that, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1336.6s)]
*  there's lots of products being tested in cancer. And so there's frankly, you know, a competition [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1341.9599999999998s)]
*  for patients and a competition for the best cancer treatment centers to get the attention [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1346.76s)]
*  of those people. And then there's both the complexity of what you might add to. And then [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1351.48s)]
*  even from a regulatory point of view, if you're, you know, kind of walking down a path to register [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1356.9199999999998s)]
*  your drug, and then in combination with something else, you need to understand would something else [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1362.12s)]
*  come in front and be better than what you're combining with? Even worse, would the drug you're [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1367.1599999999999s)]
*  combining with somehow fall off the way and not be a part of an approved FDA regimen? So it does [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  make it difficult. And you just have to, again, as part of that constant awareness, you have to [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1377.32s)]
*  constantly be thinking about not just what are we trying to prove today, but then what, you know, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  how is this leading to a registration path? I mean, how could we get FDA approval, EMA approval? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1387.32s)]
*  And what are the potential risks for that? And one of the biggest risks is, you know, a changing [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1392.4399999999998s)]
*  treatment landscape where another therapy comes in, or as I said, the therapy you're using somehow [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1397.24s)]
*  falls out of favor. So yeah, that's one of the biggest challenges we face. Quite often, the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1402.2s)]
*  public especially probably thinks that once you start a clinical trial, you just run it to the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1407.96s)]
*  end and that's the end of it. But clearly there are nuances along the way that you have to take care of. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1413.32s)]
*  No, absolutely. Because at the end of it, if it's successful, and if it's a registration [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1418.84s)]
*  enabling trial, meaning you're going to take the data to the FDA, they're going to look at everything [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1422.84s)]
*  that happened in the couple of years that you were running that trial and weigh your results in the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1427.1599999999999s)]
*  context of everything that's happened, including things that happened after you started the trial. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1433.0s)]
*  So it's absolutely the case that you need to anticipate that. And then, you know, it can be [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1437.0s)]
*  nervous times if you're in the middle of a big registration trial, and, you know, that nothing [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1441.8799999999999s)]
*  comes and upsets the apple cart, you know, there's certainly known examples where people [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1447.3999999999999s)]
*  developed successful phase three trials ready to go to FDA, and there's no point in taking it to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1451.0s)]
*  the FDA because it's either it's been superseded by something else in the marketplace. And yes, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1455.72s)]
*  that's technically a successful trial, but it's not an important trial anymore, because something [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1461.48s)]
*  else has superseded what you were testing against. And where are you currently at with [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1465.8799999999999s)]
*  your own trials? We're in what is called phase two right now. That means so we've done some [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1472.1200000000001s)]
*  exploratory work in phase one, we've identified the dose, we have identified the tumor. So right [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1476.6000000000001s)]
*  now we're in phase two trials. And the point there is to, you know, convince ourselves and convince [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1481.88s)]
*  patients, physicians, and ultimately the capital markets that these drugs, you know, are working [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1487.64s)]
*  and they have a good chance and then we move into phase three to seek registration or approval for [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1492.5200000000002s)]
*  to market the drugs. The registration process, are you working or will you be working towards [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1497.0s)]
*  the US alone or EU, Japan? Yeah, no, I think typically we would want to involve the EU and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1502.84s)]
*  Japan as well. And so our thought right now is our registration trials will be what are called [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1509.96s)]
*  global. That's a little bit of a narrow perspective global really means, you know, US and North [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1514.2s)]
*  America, Europe, Japan, for sure, maybe some in South America. Unfortunately, the way development [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1519.72s)]
*  goes right now, we don't reach some of the other parts of the world. For example, in Africa, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1525.32s)]
*  that's not typically part of it. China comes and goes sometimes as part of registered global plans, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1531.0s)]
*  then it became China only, then the FDA said that's too much China only data. So it's back to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1536.2s)]
*  looking more, incorporating them globally. But the point being there are obviously limitations. Some [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1541.24s)]
*  parts of the world don't get to experience or participate in those trials right now as we try [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1545.32s)]
*  to get the drugs approved. But hopefully then there's an opportunity to expand access as broadly [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1551.08s)]
*  as possible. Clearly, you can't guarantee anything. But what kind of timelines are you working on at [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1556.12s)]
*  the moment? Yeah, so we're hoping to start our registration trials in the, you know, let's say [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1562.6799999999998s)]
*  early 2025 timeframe. So a little more than a year from now, but not much longer than that. So really [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1567.8s)]
*  take the rest of this year, understanding our data next year to get ready to start phase three [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1573.32s)]
*  trials. It's a big endeavor. It's like, you know, I'm sorry to use a militaristic term, but I've [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1578.52s)]
*  heard of it, you know, the analogy drawn to the Normandy invasion. I mean, a global phase three [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1583.24s)]
*  trial is a big endeavor. So it takes, you know, several quarters to interact with the regulatory [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1588.2s)]
*  agencies, get everything up and going. But, you know, we're targeting early 2025, maybe the very [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1592.52s)]
*  end of 2024 for one of the drugs to start those trials. And then those would typically run about [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1598.12s)]
*  two and a half years or so on average, and then you need to collect the data and submit it to the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1602.84s)]
*  agencies. And as you said, just getting a clinical trial together is not as straightforward as it [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1607.08s)]
*  would seem. It's not that you just say, okay, we're going into phase three trials and you just [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1613.6399999999999s)]
*  start one, you've got the recruitment and that can be a challenge too. Yeah. And you have the sites, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1618.6s)]
*  you want to identify good sites. And for a phase three trial, there's a blend of very academically [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1624.4399999999998s)]
*  oriented, what are called tertiary treatment centers where you have the thought leaders, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1629.1599999999999s)]
*  but then you also have community practices. Most cancer patients are treated in what we call the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1633.16s)]
*  community, smaller practices that aren't necessarily at Harvard, Dana-Farber's, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1637.96s)]
*  Memorial Sloan Kettering, Stanford's, MD Anderson's of the world. You love to start your trial there [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1642.1200000000001s)]
*  because you're right at the cutting edge of understanding. But again, most cancer patients [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1647.4s)]
*  are treated in more smaller centers in the community. And so you need a good mix of both [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1651.96s)]
*  of those types. And that's just in the United States. And then you go to Europe and Japan and [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1656.44s)]
*  treatment is provided differently there. And so you need to factor all of that in and really [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1661.16s)]
*  establish good relationships with the sites and with the clinical study coordinators there. So [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1665.5600000000002s)]
*  there's the MDs, but there's also the people who actually get the patients into the trial. And [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1670.76s)]
*  all of that's a very big logistical operation on top of the scientific and medical connections [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1675.3200000000002s)]
*  and thinking that needs to go into the trials. Is it important to get diversity in trials in terms [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1681.48s)]
*  of gender, age, race? It's critical for a couple of reasons. One, again, you know, we're in mission [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1687.56s)]
*  to try to treat humans with disease. So that includes all the people just from a first [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1693.0s)]
*  principles point of view, you want to provide the therapy as much as possible. And if there are any [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1697.1599999999999s)]
*  differences in one group or another, you want to understand that early and try to provide the [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1702.6s)]
*  benefit as broadly as possible. And of course, the regulatory agencies now have made a big deal of [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1706.6799999999998s)]
*  this as I believe they should. They've understood that treatment historically has too much been [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  focused on very narrow groups. And so it's part of their expectation that you'll show them how [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1716.44s)]
*  you're including both genders and also people of different backgrounds in the trials, pediatrics [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1722.52s)]
*  as well. What is your plan to test your drug in younger children? So the agencies now have made it [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1728.8400000000001s)]
*  a expectation, in fact, the requirement of clinical development that you'll address this. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  You go back to the fundamental mission of the company, that's not adverse to our mission. It's [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1739.48s)]
*  just something that maybe the industry needed a little prodding from the agencies to say, you know, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1743.4s)]
*  you're here to treat disease, treat everybody who potentially treat everybody who has the disease, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1747.96s)]
*  not just the narrow segment that historically clinical trials have focused on. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1753.3200000000002s)]
*  Will Barron You were saying earlier about how it's an exciting time to be [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1757.24s)]
*  in cancer research. Clearly, you're very hopeful about the future. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1760.8400000000001s)]
*  Dr. David Pletka Yeah, I would say that I am. Again, I think you have to have the perspective [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1764.68s)]
*  that this is a deadly disease and people are dying all the time. But I think we are making [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1768.3600000000001s)]
*  remarkable progress again, I've been in the industry now almost 40 years. And I really [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1773.24s)]
*  went back into cancer 10 years ago, because it felt very much like antivirals did in the mid 90s. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1777.64s)]
*  I didn't recognize it at the time. But I remember how all the pieces were starting to come together. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1782.92s)]
*  I'll overuse my chess analogy. We finally knew how all the pieces moved on the board. Okay, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1787.16s)]
*  let's start playing a game. So 10 years ago, cancer really felt that way. It's like, oh, we're [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1792.1200000000001s)]
*  finally understanding it was, you know, human genome kind of 2000 war on cancer going back to [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1796.36s)]
*  Nixon in the 70s. It's very hard. It's very complex. But it really felt like we actually [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1802.04s)]
*  kind of understand the disease. Now we have to go invent therapies and test them and they won't all [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1808.04s)]
*  work. But I am very helpful that I think we do understand a lot more about cancer's complexity. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1812.6s)]
*  And not just that it is complex, but we've taken the complexity apart. We've understood the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1818.28s)]
*  interaction between tumors and the immune system, which is critical, the other major advance in [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1822.76s)]
*  therapy in addition to targeted therapy. So I actually am very hopeful that that we understand [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1828.2s)]
*  so much more about the disease. We have so many different ways of inventing products now, and not [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1833.64s)]
*  just small molecules, but we have, you know, RNA DNA therapies, we have cell based therapies. So [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1839.24s)]
*  we still have a ways to go, but it feels so different than it did. You know, in the 90s, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1845.48s)]
*  when I worked on cancer, it was like, I may try to kill the tumor cells before you kill all the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1849.64s)]
*  other cells in the body and come up with things that kill cells. And hopefully we'll find a little [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1853.64s)]
*  bit of a window in retrospect that was, you know, far too simple an understanding of the disease. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1857.64s)]
*  So I am very hopeful that we've picked apart all the knowledge and now we're in that phase [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1865.4s)]
*  of reassembling things. And as you reassemble and you invent something and you test it and go, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1870.0400000000002s)]
*  you know, it kind of works like what we thought it might work. That's a signal to say, okay, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1874.68s)]
*  we understand the rules of the game now, probably haven't figured out every last little trick in [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1879.0800000000002s)]
*  cancer's book yet. And, you know, it's a form of little foe and we're going to have to keep [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1883.3200000000002s)]
*  fighting for a while. But I feel like the industry broadly and academics were so much [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1887.16s)]
*  more empowered than we were before in order to understand cancer. And that's the first step [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1891.4s)]
*  towards actually being able to come up with successful treatments. Hopefully working towards [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1895.48s)]
*  that checkmate then. Yeah, exactly. Right. At least a stalemate. We'll take a stalemate, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1900.0400000000002s)]
*  probably, but checkmate would be better. Yeah, exactly. It's getting better anyway, that's for [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1905.8000000000002s)]
*  sure. Yes, absolutely. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1911.8s)]
*  Great to hear more ways in which cancer is being targeted. Certainly learned a lot from Steve in [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHcKQnYWys&t=1917.8799999999999s)]
