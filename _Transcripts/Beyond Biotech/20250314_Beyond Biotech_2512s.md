# Regeneration Biomedical: Fighting Alzheimer's with innovative stem cell therapies
**Beyond Biotech:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Cassane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 139 for the podcast. This week, I'm in conversation with Christopher [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=12.48s)]
*  Duma of Regeneration Biomedical, a Newport Beach-based clinical stage company specializing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=18.96s)]
*  in innovative stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. I hope you enjoy my interview with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=25.86s)]
*  Regeneration Biomedical's president and founder, Dr. Christopher Duma. Christopher, welcome. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=32.54s)]
*  Maybe you can start by telling us a little about your journey in medicine. You haven't [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=40.14s)]
*  always been running a biotech, that's for sure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=43.46s)]
*  That's very, very true, Dylan. Thank you for the invitation. Yeah, I think when I was nine [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=47.7s)]
*  or 10 years old, I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to help people. I had a family physician [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=54.94s)]
*  that was a great role model and that led me down the path to definitely be pre-med when [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=61.62s)]
*  I was in college. In college, I was fascinated by the brain and I was a neurosciences major. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=68.66s)]
*  So the interest in the brain started as early as when I was in my late teens. Finishing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=77.46s)]
*  college, went to medical school, that was a definite. I was thinking to be a neurologist, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=86.5s)]
*  but as you move on through medical school, you realize whether you're a medical type [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  or a surgical type, they have two different, very different personalities and I was the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=97.86s)]
*  surgical type. Neurosurgery was a perfect solution for me. I went on to do my neurosurgical [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=102.98s)]
*  training at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. I then went and did a small stint in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  England, by the way. Six months at the Atkinson Morley's Hospital in England. This was a very [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  brilliant six months I spent with the famed Henry Marsh, who wrote a book called First [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=133.38s)]
*  Do No Harm. So I have been really blessed with having a very positive experience in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  the field of neurosurgery and brought that to the West Coast in California and have been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=149.82s)]
*  practicing as an active neurosurgeon for the last 30 years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=155.34s)]
*  In those 30 years, there must have been some big evolutions in the field, some big changes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=162.62s)]
*  What are the ones that really stand out to you? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=166.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. It really has been fascinating. First of all, the technology that we use in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=170.22s)]
*  operating room is massively different than it was 30 years ago. Microscopes have become [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=179.1s)]
*  more intuitive. They have image injection into the oculars of the microscope, so you're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=186.1s)]
*  actually seeing MRI images in your oculars of the microscope while you're operating [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  on the brain. We have 3D guidance now, computer guidance with various systems like the stealth [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=200.78s)]
*  system and surgical theater, 3D rendering of brains, and the 3D rendering models can [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=208.94s)]
*  be injected over the patient's brain while we're operating. I can actually see through [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=214.66s)]
*  a tumor and know that there's a large artery or a vein below it to watch out for. Yeah, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=219.74s)]
*  it's really advanced significantly over the years and it's really more getting toward [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=227.82s)]
*  the concept of AI and 3D modeling in the operating room now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  What were some of the projects or the breakthroughs that you worked on yourself in neurosurgery [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=241.02s)]
*  over these recent years? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=246.22s)]
*  Well that's a very good question. My holy grail is to treat this horrible disease called [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  glioblastoma, which is the most malignant brain tumor that exists in the brain. It is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=256.98s)]
*  an incurable disease. Your survival is 14 months once you get the diagnosis, that's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=264.62s)]
*  the median. So one of my missions was to figure something out, something different in the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=273.66s)]
*  treatment of that. And that's another disease where we've had no traction in the treatment [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=280.26s)]
*  of that disease for about 40 years, four zero. And it's been boggling the minds of neurologists, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=287.46s)]
*  neurosurgeons, oncologists for that long and we still don't have a control for that. I [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=296.46s)]
*  use a machine called the gamma knife, which is focused radiation, and I use it in a special [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=303.46s)]
*  way where we treat along the tracks where the tumor is going to migrate through the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  brain. So we basically treat it as if we're cutting it off at the pass, stopping the last [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=314.38s)]
*  migrating cell getting through the brain. And that has a United States patent and it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=322.86s)]
*  is a way that I treat glioblastoma to this day. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=329.26s)]
*  This is something a little bit different though than what you're working on with regeneration [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=334.46s)]
*  biomedical. What's the vision behind regeneration? What's the vision behind this new company? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, it stems from the same need, my need to fix a problem. And the problem is, is that we [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=344.94000000000005s)]
*  haven't had a new treatment for the neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease. We have not had a new treatment for those in about 20 [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  years. Recently in the last year or two, there have been two biopharma companies that have [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=370.14s)]
*  put out a couple of monoclonal antibodies that are at least targeting amyloid plaques in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=378.53999999999996s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease. But unfortunately, they're not really disease modifying. They don't [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=384.78s)]
*  improve the patient's cognition. They just slow the deterioration. So, you know, our company [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  that I formed in 2018 is targeting these diseases that have an unmet need for new and different [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=399.1s)]
*  therapies. We're targeting all of these diseases using stem cells instead of a single targeting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=408.7s)]
*  factor. For example, a multi-faceted approach to treating these diseases. It's my philosophy and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=418.94s)]
*  the company's philosophy that these diseases do not have a single targetable problem. Like [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease. Do you think there's one problem? If you remove the amyloid plaque, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=436.78s)]
*  you still have some tangles to remove that are phosphorylated tau. There are other problems going [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=443.26s)]
*  on. There's problems with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, membrane [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=447.98s)]
*  transport problems, inflammatory issues. Can a single pill or a single IV injection really [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  target all of those at once? And so our philosophy is that maybe a stem cell can do that. That's kind [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  of their mission. They can target multiple things at once. So why not use stem cells to target these [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  dreaded diseases? And by the way, the way we use stem cells and our actual product [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=477.58s)]
*  is used in a very novel way. We actually are the first in mankind to inject the stem cells [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=487.9s)]
*  directly into the brain for Alzheimer's disease, for example. So we're not giving an IV. We're [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=494.94s)]
*  not giving an oral drug. We're trying to defeat the blood brain barrier by [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=501.02s)]
*  direct injection into the brain. Was there a particular patient case or was there a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=506.46s)]
*  particular personal experience, something back in 2018 that gave you the impetus to launch into [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=512.54s)]
*  regeneration biomedical? No, it wasn't a single, it was probably thousands. Over the years, over [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  my years as a neurosurgeon, thousands of people come across my desk in consultation that have [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=527.18s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease, that have ALS, that have MS, that have stroke, Parkinson's disease. And [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=536.8599999999999s)]
*  I just sit back and I say, there's got to be something for these people. And that was the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=544.14s)]
*  you know, the light bulb that lit up over my head back in 2018 that we really have to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=551.7399999999999s)]
*  do something about this and use the FDA to do it. I had done some research prior to 2018 [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=560.06s)]
*  in rats, an IRB approach in humans that actually had some merit to it. And we realized that we can [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  inject things into the brain and let them do their job. So that was the light bulb that went [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=578.46s)]
*  over my head at that time. And obviously, if you're going FDA, you know, one of the reasons to go FDA [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=586.38s)]
*  is to get legitimacy. There's a lot of illegitimacy in the field of stem cell work, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=593.58s)]
*  to get legitimacy and to be guided by the FDA. And, you know, I had to inject pigs en route to [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=599.4200000000001s)]
*  get through FDA clearance for this. And I put little ports in pigs heads, and then we injected [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=609.9000000000001s)]
*  our stem cell product and the FDA like that. And believe it or not, they gave us clearance for a [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  phase one trial. So since 2021, we would excuse me 2022, we received FDA clearance to actually do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=625.26s)]
*  this work in humans. So we're the first really that we know of that that are doing this. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=636.3s)]
*  Maybe you can you can just take I can take a step back and just ask for a bit more of an overview [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=643.98s)]
*  of where you are when it comes to research and development, the pipeline there you're talking [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=650.86s)]
*  about these injections and being able to work with with humans there. Can you give me an overview [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=654.94s)]
*  of what the pipeline looks like of what the the research is right now? Yeah, absolutely. So [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  as I as I mentioned, the the when we actually proposed this to the FDA, that was in 2021, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=668.7800000000001s)]
*  they gave us a laundry list of things to check off. And we did that we you know, we satisfied [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=680.22s)]
*  that laundry list. And then that took about a year. And then they came back to us and said, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=687.34s)]
*  Well, we still want you to do work in large, large mammals. A Yucatan mini pig is a large animal [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=692.62s)]
*  weighs about 70 pounds. And so I went down to a vivarium in in San Diego, and did that work, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=701.26s)]
*  those animals were sacrificed, they sent to a separate lab. And the results of the analysis [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=709.5s)]
*  went to the FDA and the FDA said, Okay, you're cleared for human for a human trial. So when you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=715.58s)]
*  start your human trial, you need a sponsoring site. You need a hospital that would be willing [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=724.62s)]
*  to do the research and my home hospital here, Hogue, Hogue Memorial Hospital Presbyterian here [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=734.3s)]
*  in Newport Beach was very open to welcoming this research because there hadn't been anything like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=741.26s)]
*  it. So they gave the green light for the research to be done here. The FDA said you only need [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=746.86s)]
*  nine patients to do the phase one. And phase one is typically and as is ours, a safety trial. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=753.82s)]
*  So we're looking purely for safety. And not as a primary as a primary endpoint, we are also looking [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=765.4200000000001s)]
*  for efficacy on the side. But we started our first injection of our very first patient in March of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=772.5400000000001s)]
*  2024. So last year, so our very first injected patient is out almost one year now. And it's been [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=782.3000000000001s)]
*  it's been quite dramatic what we've seen and, and what we've experienced. Since that time, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=792.14s)]
*  we've injected five for others. So we have five total injected patients, we have [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=798.86s)]
*  four more patients in the pipeline ready to go because of the, you know, need for nine patients. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=805.42s)]
*  And of the five patients, not one has had even a headache after the injection of the cells into [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=811.98s)]
*  the brain. That's the pipeline. So that's where we are. We're we've we've finished our fifth [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=819.26s)]
*  patient and we're moving to the sixth patient. And to continue the pipeline, we expect to be [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=825.9s)]
*  complete with the phase one by the middle of this year. And then we will propose to the FDA [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=833.5s)]
*  a phase two trial, which will be multi institution, placebo controlled, and move on with about 70 [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  patients. So they're really the next milestones in in the clinic there. And you're looking to do that [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  really within the next year, next two years? Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, time is of the essence. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=859.26s)]
*  I mean, you know, we're it's like David and Goliath, you know, you know, we're David in the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=865.58s)]
*  world of big pharma, and we'd like to move at their pace. It's incredible how quickly they get [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=870.14s)]
*  drugs out and do 1000 patient studies in a matter of, you know, very few years. So we're, we're, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=876.46s)]
*  we're in there with them. And you're focused primarily or only on Alzheimer's now? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=884.46s)]
*  They scope right, expand that, right? That's exactly right. We know that if we get approval [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=890.14s)]
*  from our phase one, to move to a phase two, that all of the data from the phase one can be used [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=899.82s)]
*  in phase two studies with all those other diseases. ALS, Parkinson's disease, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=907.66s)]
*  we're thinking of working with the football players for traumatic brain injury to give them [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=917.9s)]
*  some some hope. So the only thing holding us back from that is money. It's very expensive to do [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=924.38s)]
*  these trials to do a single patient is about $150,000 for the phase one trial. So you do the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=932.78s)]
*  math, you know, for 70 patients, it gets quite expensive. So we're seeking funding for this and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=940.86s)]
*  we're moving forth. But you know, we don't have the deep pockets of big pharma. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=946.9399999999999s)]
*  Can you walk me through a little bit how your your particular stem cell therapy works? Because [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=953.3399999999999s)]
*  you're actually taking these stem cells from the individual? And is it from fat cells, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=958.6999999999999s)]
*  if I understand correctly? That is correct. So there are numerous sources of stem cells, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=963.8199999999999s)]
*  you can get bone marrow, you can get stem cells from umbilical cord, you can get it from fetuses, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=969.66s)]
*  you can get it from your own fat. And I think, first of all, no one is really averse to having [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=976.9399999999999s)]
*  a small liposuction, are they? And secondly, the fat cells are absolutely useful in in this [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=985.82s)]
*  particular instance as well. So there's nothing special about the stem cells that come from other [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=995.6600000000001s)]
*  sources. But the most special thing about our stem cells is they're they're coming from the patient [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1001.5s)]
*  themselves. So we're not taking stem cells off the shelf. We're not taking what's called allogeneic [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1007.4200000000001s)]
*  stem cells and, and putting them into the brain. And nor would I even fantasize about doing that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1014.78s)]
*  first, before using the patient's own stem cells. So the stem cells that we acquire from the patient [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1021.74s)]
*  themselves, a little liposuction, they get out about 50 cc of cells, and those cells go to our [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1029.82s)]
*  laboratory, and then they are separated into the stem cell components. We use the vascular component [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1036.3s)]
*  of the stem cells, which is much more likely to affect the neural lineages. And we prepare them [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1043.9s)]
*  in such a way that we choose the ones that are expressing something called WNT, W-N-T. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1053.5s)]
*  So I'm I don't want to, you know, spill the beans of what our secret sauce is, but our proprietary, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1061.1000000000001s)]
*  our proprietary information here. But WNT is a activating signaling protein that's seen on stem [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1069.74s)]
*  cells. And when WNT is expressed by a stem cell, it actually acts as an on off switch [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1077.98s)]
*  for other stem cells to turn on. And the stem cells will turn each other on by this expression [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1085.5s)]
*  of WNT. And that's called the WNT cascade. So if we can get the WNT cascade going in the brain [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1096.38s)]
*  to target and help any diseased areas of brain, that's kind of the that's kind of the mechanism [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1105.66s)]
*  of action. And the second mechanism of action is that we are all aware, or not everybody, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1111.98s)]
*  that there are stem cells that are living in our brains right now. So you, Dylan, and I, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1120.86s)]
*  and everybody listening to you, we have stem cells in our brains right now. And believe it or not, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1128.2199999999998s)]
*  they live right in the wall of the hollow cavities of the brain called ventricles. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1134.3799999999999s)]
*  So if we were to inject ourselves into the ventricles of the brain, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1141.58s)]
*  we would expect and hope that our stem cells will percolate into the those little stem cell areas [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1145.82s)]
*  that are already sitting there and turn on those latent stem cells that are just naturally there [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1152.62s)]
*  in all of our brains to get get to wake up and get moving. So it's kind of a paracrine effect [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1158.46s)]
*  that we're expecting. We don't expect a direct effect from our stem cells. But the beauty is, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1165.8999999999999s)]
*  is that the brain is sitting there, even the brain of an 80 year old is sitting there with stem cells [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1171.34s)]
*  waiting to be turned on. You mentioned before, you're you're bypassing the blood brain barrier [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1179.58s)]
*  by injecting directly into the into the brain. Why is it really important to bypass that barrier [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1186.78s)]
*  when you're treating a neurodegenerative disease? Yeah. So that's been the, you know, again, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1192.6999999999998s)]
*  the holy grail for for the field of pharmaceuticals, getting through that dreaded blood brain [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1199.58s)]
*  barrier. And it's Mother Nature's way of protecting our brains. It's a beautiful mechanism that [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1207.74s)]
*  it really saves us from all sorts of tyrannous problems that can happen in our lives in our [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1216.06s)]
*  daily lives. If you ingest something, it's not going to get through that blood brain barrier. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1224.54s)]
*  If you get take a poison, it might not get into that blood brain barrier. Even if you have something [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1229.74s)]
*  administered IV, it may not get through that blood brain barrier. But there was another barrier. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1235.82s)]
*  And it's called the CSF, a pendulum of that barrier. And that barrier is literally the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1241.74s)]
*  the barrier between the hollow cavities of our brain called ventricles. A lot of people [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1250.22s)]
*  don't realize that our brains are hollow. It's like a honeydew melon, you cut the melon in half, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1256.22s)]
*  and the center is hollow. If you put a tube in there and inject stem cells, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1261.02s)]
*  the layer between the brain itself and the ventricle, the hollow cavity, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1269.18s)]
*  actually becomes porous when we get older. So when we're young and thriving youngsters and [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1274.46s)]
*  babies, that barrier there, the wall of the appendema, actually has very tight junctions. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1283.82s)]
*  Interestingly, as we age, those junctions get less and less tight, and they become actually porous. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1294.78s)]
*  enough for a stem cell to eke through. And so we know from our rat work that the cells injected [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1301.02s)]
*  into the ventricle can actually percolate through these little porous defects in the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1308.54s)]
*  appendema and when they're way into the brain. And they're being they're being delivered there by [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1316.54s)]
*  cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid is floating through every area, every nerve, every nerve, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1323.02s)]
*  floating through every area, every nook and cranny of the brain. So if you want to deliver [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1328.22s)]
*  stem cells everywhere, including the spinal cord, it's a great way of doing it. And it's our [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1332.6200000000001s)]
*  invention. It's actually, frankly, my invention. And we have also a US patent for that. So that is [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1340.3s)]
*  our novel way of delivering the stem cells into the brain. Exactly what happens for an Alzheimer's [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1349.9s)]
*  patient after that. We don't know. We're going to figure that out though with CSF analyses going [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1356.62s)]
*  forward on all of our patients. Recruiting these patients for a phase two trial. Are there going [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1363.5s)]
*  to be any any ideal candidates there or any limitations placed on participants in a trial [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1370.3799999999999s)]
*  like that? Yeah. So we in our phase one, we're accepting patients between the ages of 45 and 80. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1376.9399999999998s)]
*  So that's a very large range. But we're only accepting patients who have mild to moderate [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1385.9s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease. The big pharma studies that just finished used patients that were [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1392.38s)]
*  mild cognitive impairment. That's a stage three patient and stage four patients. We're using stage [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1401.5s)]
*  four and five patients in the Alzheimer's group. Alzheimer's has seven stages of the disease and [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1407.1000000000001s)]
*  obviously stage seven is morbid. But the difficulty in enrolling is there is no difficulty. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1415.18s)]
*  The biggest difficulty is competing with other new drugs like Denanumab and Licanumab that are out [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1426.54s)]
*  there right now. And in our study, we're not allowing anybody who's had those drugs to be [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1434.54s)]
*  in our study because frankly, they cause edema and hemorrhage in the brain and brain shrinkage [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1440.14s)]
*  and have all sorts of side effects and we don't want our data kind of affected by that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1445.5s)]
*  And what about the treatment process? You talked about a period of time between the liposuction [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1453.74s)]
*  and the injection of the stem cells. But is that the extent of the treatment? Is there a secondary [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1459.3400000000001s)]
*  injection or any particular follow-up after that surgically? Right. The plan is to inject the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1465.1s)]
*  patients every two months with their cells and that would be in a phase two. Phase one that we're [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1472.06s)]
*  doing now is a single injection and when we start discussing some of our secondary endpoints, that's [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1480.06s)]
*  going to become very exciting because with only a single injection, we're getting some amazing [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1487.5s)]
*  secondary effects that are very promising. So the patient's process is exactly this. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1493.66s)]
*  They first go through a liposuction and that is about a 20-minute procedure and it's a same-day [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1502.7s)]
*  procedure. They go home that day. Then about two weeks later, they get a port implanted into their [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1509.98s)]
*  brain. It's called an Ohmaïa reservoir and we've actually used Ohmaïa reservoirs for [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1519.74s)]
*  40 years in the field of neurosurgery to deliver chemotherapy for brain cancer. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1524.78s)]
*  If one is familiar with what's called a porticath, which is the port that's placed under your collar [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1531.34s)]
*  bone to deliver chemotherapy and is used over and over and over, we have the same thing for the brain. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1537.26s)]
*  It's called an Ohmaïa reservoir and that gets implanted. That is a 15-minute operation [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1543.9s)]
*  with extremely low risk and once that's implanted, it's under the scalp so no one sees it [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1549.9s)]
*  and once that's in there, the tube that goes into the brain can deliver our stem cells over and over [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1558.22s)]
*  again. The fat that was taken on the first stage is worked on at our lab and then cryopreserved. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1565.9s)]
*  So we sift out the Wnt-expressing cells. We save them, store them and a single liposuction [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1574.5400000000002s)]
*  should be good for an entire year of injection in a patient in a phase two trial every two months. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1585.02s)]
*  Well yeah, I mean and then finally once the cells are ready to be injected into the brain, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1596.14s)]
*  which is about four weeks after we work with them, then the cells are requested by the physician [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1601.18s)]
*  and they come in a small syringe and they are injected at the patient's bedside through the port [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1610.94s)]
*  in a five-minute procedure. That doesn't hurt at all. Putting the needle into the port doesn't hurt [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1620.0600000000002s)]
*  and the cells are injected and then the patient goes home. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1625.66s)]
*  Let's take a step back and maybe look at a bigger picture here in the US. How would you describe the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1631.5s)]
*  state of stem cell therapy research right now in the US? Is it advancing? Is it stuck? Is the new [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1639.02s)]
*  administration scaring people into not moving forward? Well I think that stem cell research [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1645.5s)]
*  has really gotten a bad name in the past. I mean there's these rogue clinics that are [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1654.14s)]
*  using stem cells to treat the common cold has been a problem in the field of stem cell research. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1662.38s)]
*  The only way in my opinion to legitimize that research is to get in with the FDA and use FDA [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1673.5800000000002s)]
*  cleared trials. But as far as changing the mentality of a patient traveling to China [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1683.3400000000001s)]
*  or Germany to get a single stem cell procedure for God knows what at an exorbitant price, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1692.22s)]
*  that still is going on. But as far as legitimate research that's going on like ours, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1702.0600000000002s)]
*  we're very few are being done right now. There are a few that I know of that are actually [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1708.62s)]
*  injecting into the brain but not like we are through the ventricles and getting some promising [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1718.1399999999999s)]
*  results. But again with a disease like Alzheimer's disease, MS, these are whole brain and spinal cord [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1723.82s)]
*  diseases. You need to get your stem cells everywhere in the brain and you can't just target certain [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1731.02s)]
*  areas. So I think to answer your question, we're getting there and it's starting and it's the [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1737.1s)]
*  beginning of what's called personalized medicine. Personalized medicine is probably the next [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1743.58s)]
*  iteration of the pharmaceutical industry. It's very easy to take a pill but it may not be the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1749.74s)]
*  solution for certain problems. I mean you may have to get a hole drilled in your head and a port [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1758.86s)]
*  placed to treat Alzheimer's disease or any of the others. You mentioned the cost for a phase two [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1764.38s)]
*  trial, a phase two clinical trial. Is the financial landscape or the maybe the scientific landscape or [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1773.42s)]
*  the regulatory landscape, are these challenges for people in your position to overcome? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1780.8600000000001s)]
*  Well there's you mentioned a few things there, the financial and regulatory, right? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1787.8200000000002s)]
*  In terms of financing our work, our phase one trial has been financed by friends and family money. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1794.8600000000001s)]
*  Almost everybody's been touched by Alzheimer's disease and our first phase one trial is for [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1803.42s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease only. Everybody's had you know six degrees of separation of someone with [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1809.18s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease, family members, etc. And you know people are willing to you know donate or [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1815.1000000000001s)]
*  invest money into these projects. When we get into the phase two level we're talking about a [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1823.74s)]
*  need of about 25 million dollars to do a 70 patient phase two trial over a year and a half. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1831.34s)]
*  So those numbers get a little bit dramatic and still there are private investors who can come [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1839.74s)]
*  up with that. There's institutional money that can come up with that. There's investors and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1845.9s)]
*  financiers who will do that and they just what they do is they get stock in our company and [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1851.98s)]
*  they you know see how we do as we move on as an investment. But right now we have been [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1859.6599999999999s)]
*  seeking the series B round of 25 million dollars to be satisfied that we can fully start and not [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1870.3799999999999s)]
*  have to quit halfway through a phase two trial. So that's number one and number two is the [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1879.58s)]
*  regulatory. I think I'm just fascinated that the FDA allowed us to go forth with this and the real [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1887.98s)]
*  reason is I think is that there's an unmet need. We need to treat these diseases. A lot of them [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1898.06s)]
*  have absolutely no effective treatments. Number two it's been decades since there's been [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1904.78s)]
*  any good treatments for these and number three if the stem cell world is now going to become [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1913.74s)]
*  something real the FDA wants to regulate it and I say that's okay. We want to keep the [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1920.1399999999999s)]
*  legitimate people in the pipeline and the illegitimate ones out. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1927.98s)]
*  How does the U.S. compare to two other countries when it comes to stem cell therapies and the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1935.58s)]
*  research and development there? Yeah I mean there are a few other countries that are a little less [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1941.4199999999998s)]
*  a little more lenient less strict with stem cell work. Japan is one of them and China is another. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1947.98s)]
*  They're a little more open to stem cell research but really that's about it. I mean the European, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1957.1s)]
*  I don't know much about the European you know the European Medical Association whether they're [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1964.3s)]
*  allowing stem cell work there but I'm a little out of touch with that but I think by virtue of our [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1972.1399999999999s)]
*  doing our work right now here in the U.S. I think they're looking to us. The FDA is looking to us [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1979.1799999999998s)]
*  to allow further studies to be done and they're going to be very happy with this with the results [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1987.26s)]
*  we have. In the past stem cell therapies were sometimes considered a little controversial [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1992.9399999999998s)]
*  depending on where the stem cells were were brought in from. You don't have any of those [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=1999.82s)]
*  problems when they come from a person's own fat cells. Precisely I mean it's really a social issue [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2004.78s)]
*  a personal issue when it comes to getting stem cells from aborted fetuses for example or from [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2014.94s)]
*  fetal tissue. So yes we're not using that and I didn't think that this FDA would even approve it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2022.54s)]
*  They wouldn't even come close to approving that as one of the first trials of its kind. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2033.74s)]
*  Let's take a look a little bit into the future now. Obviously you're looking forward to phase [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2038.46s)]
*  two clinical trials but if you were looking a little bit further ahead sort of the five or [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2043.9s)]
*  ten year horizon where do you see regeneration biomedical then? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2048.14s)]
*  We have this vision of becoming the fathers of stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2052.86s)]
*  diseases in the brain. We believe that we can move forward with the phase two. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2073.1s)]
*  Let me just tell you a little about the results of phase one that are not the primary endpoints. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2079.4199999999996s)]
*  The secondary endpoints out of the first five patients we've seen actual cognitive improvement [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2084.7799999999997s)]
*  in their cognition in four out of the five their ADAS cog scores went up. Their mini mental status [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2094.46s)]
*  scores went up. Their ADL scores went up. So that has not even been seen by big pharma with their [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2103.26s)]
*  two new drugs. We've also seen a decrease in the amyloid plaque density. We look at that using [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2109.7400000000002s)]
*  amyloid PET scans. So every patient in our study is getting a PET scan and you can see the reduction [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2121.34s)]
*  of the amyloid plaques by half in our single dose for the patients. By the way we're also [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2127.02s)]
*  seeing the same results for phosphorylated tau which is the tangles that are seen in Alzheimer's [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2134.94s)]
*  disease. Those have all normalized 100% in all five patients so far. Family members are saying [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2140.62s)]
*  wow our family member is doing great. They're much better. By the way in one year like our first [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2148.7s)]
*  patient is out now one year we should see some significant decline in their cognitive function [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2155.58s)]
*  but they seem to be stable or improving. So that's really very promising. So we expect phase two to [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2162.06s)]
*  look the same and then after phase two you make the decision whether to move to a phase three if [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2170.46s)]
*  you have enough money to do that and investor money etc. Or big pharma may pick it up. Now they [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2179.02s)]
*  may also pick it up now as a synergistic approach to a disease where they're for example using their [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2187.1s)]
*  monoclonal antibodies to clean up the debris of beta amyloid that's the plaques and then hitting [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2196.38s)]
*  it with a chaser of stem cells such as ours to build repair and repair really a lot of different [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2205.42s)]
*  mechanisms. You know the membrane transport is one of the biggest problems in these diseases and [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2216.54s)]
*  protein folding is a big problem in these diseases and perhaps the stem cells are good at [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2226.62s)]
*  profilaxing against that. So the short answer is we will see after phase two where we are. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2234.06s)]
*  Are you actively looking for big pharma partnerships or are you still sticking with [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2243.98s)]
*  private fundraising? No we'd be delighted to entertain big pharma partnerships absolutely. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2248.94s)]
*  I would never turn anything away at this point in our development but I'm quite sure they're [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2257.34s)]
*  all probably waiting to see what phase two looks like. You've been a researcher, you've been a [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2265.42s)]
*  surgeon, you're now on the business side as well, really an entrepreneur. What sort of advice could [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2272.46s)]
*  you give to someone who's really interested in neurodegenerative diseases and finding solutions? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2279.1000000000004s)]
*  Where can they start? What should they be reading? Yeah well I think the, well interesting you should [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2286.2999999999997s)]
*  say, what should they be reading? A lot of my work, a lot of my reading is done by signing up [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2293.98s)]
*  with Google Scholar. Google Scholar is a way where you can put in key words and Google Scholar will [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2301.66s)]
*  send you every week the latest scientific articles that have come out with those key words in it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2310.94s)]
*  So you know in my case it's you know stem cells, neurodegenerative diseases, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2318.38s)]
*  and subventricular zone, that's the zone that has the stem cells in our brains innately. So I want [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2326.46s)]
*  to see where all the research is going. So that's what you read, that's what you look at because [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2334.46s)]
*  it's literally the fastest information you can get. You know obviously listening to your podcast, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2339.58s)]
*  Dylan, Beyond Biotech is a source, another source for anybody very interested in this [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2348.94s)]
*  and updated. I mean you're talking to me live in a very updated fashion, you're hearing the latest [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2355.9s)]
*  even before we publish. The second is to go to scientific meetings. I have been submitting to [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2364.06s)]
*  various meetings locally here in the United States and internationally. We just got back from presenting [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2372.62s)]
*  in Madrid at CTAD, which is Clinical Trials for Alzheimer's Disease, and we got picked up by a [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2378.3s)]
*  podcast there, which is, excuse me, by a digital news source there called Biospace, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2385.98s)]
*  and they compared us with side by side with Biogen, Eli Lilly, and good old Regeneration [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2394.94s)]
*  Biomedical. So we got some real traction there, but interestingly we just submitted to the ISCT, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2402.54s)]
*  that's the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy. The meeting is in New Orleans in May, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2410.62s)]
*  and we are very proud to say that our abstract received an award. They only give about 20 awards [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2417.1s)]
*  out of about 1,500 abstracts, and we were one of them for our abstract submission, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2425.9s)]
*  and we will be giving a podium presentation at that meeting in May. So that's a feather in our cap. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2434.7799999999997s)]
*  And finally, I would say to any new researcher, think outside the box. I did, and believe it or [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2441.8199999999997s)]
*  not, by perseverance the FDA approved it. So if you're thinking outside the box, you've got to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2450.06s)]
*  think of something new, novel, different, go for it. And I would suggest that don't be shy, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2457.5s)]
*  don't be bashful, and try something new. Christopher Dumer, thanks for joining us on [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2467.18s)]
*  Beyond Biotech. Thanks very much for having me on. That's it for this episode. Don't forget to check [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swdYpiwTDdk&t=2475.1s)]
