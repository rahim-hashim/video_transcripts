# Redefining chronic pain treatment
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 90. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=16.0s)]
*  This week we're talking about a condition everyone has experienced to some degree, and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=19.56s)]
*  Jackson Brower is the Chief Scientific Officer at Doloromics and we had an in-depth conversation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=26.36s)]
*  about chronic pain, what's new in pain treatment and how Doloromics is addressing the field. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=33.24s)]
*  And I first asked about the company's recent exit from stealth. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=40.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely happy to do that. So just as an intro to the audience as well, I'm Jackson [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=44.84s)]
*  Brower, co-founder and CSO of Doloromics. We are a precision neuropharmaceuticals company. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=51.48s)]
*  So to answer the question, we initially incorporated just about four years ago now during COVID, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  a little bit of a hectic time to be forming a company. But the idea at the time was this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  emergence of how can we use newer technologies that are coming online, particularly in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=69.64s)]
*  omics space, so starting to take advantage of different single cell transcriptomic technologies [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=77.0s)]
*  or proteomic technologies to actually better understand the progression of neurological [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=83.0s)]
*  diseases like chronic pain. As we have grown, we've started to expand our areas that we are [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=91.0s)]
*  looking to treat beyond chronic pain, but we have concerted effort there and plan to initially [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  address indications within that space. So jumping back to that timeline about four years ago, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=104.92s)]
*  we had the opportunity upon forming the company to actually join Illumina's accelerator program. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=112.84s)]
*  So for those unfamiliar, Illumina is kind of like the Microsoft or the Google of the sequencing world [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=119.0s)]
*  where there are other competitors, but by far they have the market dominance in the established [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  players in the field. And while it's not around any longer, at the time Illumina was running a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=134.2s)]
*  twice a year or two cycle a year accelerator program wherein you could move out to either [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  the Bay Area or a site that they had in Cambridge in the UK and actually be given lab space to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=147.32s)]
*  set up your company for about six months and also have access to their sequencers. That was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=154.76s)]
*  tremendously helpful for us because at the same time we had just set up a few different collaborations [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=161.24s)]
*  to give us access to human sensory tissue. So we were working and still continue to work with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  several different organ procurement organizations. These are the groups that facilitate things like [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=172.68s)]
*  transplants of vital organs to actually access human sensory tissue. So primarily dorsal root ganglion [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  and spinal cord to be able to sequence it and omically profile it using those resources at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=183.88s)]
*  Illumina. So that's really where we began about four years ago. When I look back on the company [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=190.6s)]
*  itself there's this almost natural progression where we went from building around this idea of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=196.44s)]
*  we need to characterize these tissues better. We need to understand how we as humans differentiate [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=205.24s)]
*  from non-human species like different rodents that pain therapeutic identification work has traditionally [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=211.24s)]
*  been performed in. We need to go from there to actually building up these databases to allow us [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=218.28s)]
*  to identify novel therapeutic targets. Once we had done that kind of the second stage of our [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  evolution was to build a computational platform around that which we now call Dolores. Kind of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=230.52s)]
*  a play on our name Doloromics and that root Dolor meaning pain in Latin. We developed this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=236.04s)]
*  computational platform to identify novel therapeutic targets from the data that we were generating [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=243.72s)]
*  and then from there we kind of entered this build phase that we've been in for the last few years [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=249.96s)]
*  of actually starting to build out a therapeutic pipeline with several different assets in it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=254.44s)]
*  We haven't listed what those targets are just yet but we've listed some of the indication spaces [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=259.88s)]
*  that we plan to go after things that are being addressed in the field right now like migraine [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=265.24s)]
*  but as well as looking at some underserved areas like fibromyalgia. That's kind of the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=270.84s)]
*  progression of the company over the past four years in a quick little snapshot. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=275.32s)]
*  You're looking at pain. I wonder if you could kind of explain chronic pain and how much of a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=281.0s)]
*  problem chronic pain is. Yeah absolutely. So this will be a good little test for me. I'm going to see [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  I believe I can recite the International Association for the Study of Pain's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=295.88000000000005s)]
*  definition of pain and chronic pain. So you can fact check this after the fact and see if I got [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  it right. But I believe that IASP defines pain itself not chronic pain but pain as an unpleasant [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=306.12s)]
*  sensory and emotional experience related to or associated with actual or potential tissue damage. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=313.72s)]
*  So that's kind of a very roundabout way of saying pain is this thing that we perceive [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=321.88s)]
*  that can be related to tissue damage or disease but isn't necessarily. Chronic pain is then defined [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=329.08s)]
*  as pain that persists or recurs for more than three months in most definitions of chronic pain. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=335.8s)]
*  To your second part of that question the actual problem or you know how big of an issue is chronic [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=342.68s)]
*  pain. Well I know it may be a little bit less an issue while still an issue for your EU and UK [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=349.24s)]
*  audience. Most folks who have turned on the news over the past 10 years are familiar in the US at [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  least with the rising opioid epidemic which is part and parcel fueled by the incidence rate of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=363.08s)]
*  chronic pain. So we can look at the kind of problem of pain through that angle or through any other [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=370.04s)]
*  number of angles that we'd like to. As far as the incidence rate goes again in different surveys of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=376.92s)]
*  individuals you do see a wide range though commonly the percentages that you'll see really range [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  anywhere from 20 to 30 percent of the population worldwide. So it's a significant proportion of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=391.24s)]
*  the human population that suffers from chronic pain. I think one of the things that's really [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  notable here is that that increases with age. So while that may be 20 to 30 percent of the total [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=401.64s)]
*  population when we look at elderly populations or individuals over the age of 65 in particular [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=408.68s)]
*  you start to see that prevalence exceeding 50 percent of the population which obviously has [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  huge downstream costs both economically and personally as well for those populations that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=420.68s)]
*  are suffering from chronic pain. When it comes to treating chronic pain or even defining it how much [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=427.0s)]
*  of an issue is the challenge of pain being kind of subjective? I would certainly say right on that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=435.16s)]
*  last part especially pain is an individualized experience. It is difficult to minimize another [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=442.12s)]
*  individual's pain because there isn't a unified measure right. We can't do things that we can do [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=449.24s)]
*  like an oncology where we can diagnose cancers based on their staging. To an extent we are all [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=456.92s)]
*  familiar with going to the doctor and pointing at a series of faces from zero to ten with zero [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=464.12s)]
*  being a smiley face and ten being a very upset face but at the same time you write pain as a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=471.32s)]
*  uniquely individual experience and oftentimes when we're relating that experience to others [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=476.6s)]
*  you do run the risk of it being minimalized. I think maybe the way that we try to address that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=481.72s)]
*  at Dolaromics is delineating this idea of no-suception versus pain itself. Again pain [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=487.24s)]
*  being that emotional experience that we have due we believe at Dolaromics to changes in no-suception [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  particularly in chronic pain and I'm happy to dive into that if you'd like. Yeah that would be [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=503.72s)]
*  that would be good. So when we at Dolaromics think about no-suception we primarily focus on [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  nociceptors which are highly specialized sensory neurons within the peripheral nervous system [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  but kind of backing up a step no-suception itself is referring to physiological processes [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  our body's ability to detect harmful stimuli again originating in the periphery and signaling [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=528.1199999999999s)]
*  to higher central brain areas. So the kind of first step of no-suception is the activation of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=536.92s)]
*  those sensory neurons those nociceptors in response to either tissue damage or other stimuli. Thinking [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=545.2399999999999s)]
*  back to like a neuro 101 course those can be broadly grouped into thermal mechanical or [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=553.88s)]
*  chemical stimuli that are causing those nociceptors to activate. From there no-suception itself has [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=560.12s)]
*  really canonically been thought of as these four key processes transduction so that initial [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  activation of nociceptors and generation of electrical signals which is key part of our [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=573.24s)]
*  ability to actually develop novel therapeutics and we can dive into that in a minute. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=579.08s)]
*  From transduction we go to transmission so that's kind of encompassing that transmission of action [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=584.44s)]
*  potentials and signals from the periphery to the spinal cord to higher brain regions and then the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  last two processes are modulation of that signal within the spinal cord and then the perception. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=596.5200000000001s)]
*  So that's where we're starting to again tie more into that component of pain as a emotional [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=603.4s)]
*  sensation that we feel and there is a difference between nociception and pain right when we are [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  referring to nociception we are talking about these electrical signals in our ability to either in [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=616.84s)]
*  some cases measure them that's most often ex vivo but there are clinical methods for doing so [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  and also to modulate them and ideally develop novel therapeutics around them. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=630.44s)]
*  You're right that pain itself is still subjective however I believe and we can talk about it that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=637.4s)]
*  recent clinical successes in addressing that actual transmission of the signal both the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=644.04s)]
*  transmission of the signal and the transduction of the signal really do pave the way for us as a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=651.88s)]
*  precision neuropharmaceutical company to come in and develop novel therapeutics. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=657.8s)]
*  What would you say the biggest challenge is when it comes to developing new ways of treating pain? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah I think for us the biggest challenge and where we've spent a bulk of our time is actually [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=669.8s)]
*  in identifying targets for the treatment of pain. In the field right now the hot areas of kind of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=676.52s)]
*  this next stage of analgesics is largely around sodium channels and other ion channels as well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=685.16s)]
*  Since the beginning of 2024 I have seen the rise really the splash around three different companies [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  that have come out are either come out of stealth as well or launched clinical trials or you know [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=700.92s)]
*  kind of whatever however else you want to characterize that. Anyways those being vertex [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=708.1999999999999s)]
*  pharmaceuticals which has a clinical stage nav 1.8 channel inhibitor a company known as Latigo [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=712.28s)]
*  which is also developing sodium channel inhibitors and then a company known as Noceon who are also [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=719.48s)]
*  developing ion channel inhibitors. All of these three companies really what they hold in common [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=725.3199999999999s)]
*  is that they are specifically looking to modulate that initial transduction or transmission of those [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=731.72s)]
*  painful signals from the periphery to the brain. In some of the literature that you sent me you'd [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=738.76s)]
*  kind of mentioned how chronic pain could be redefined from a symptom to a disease in its [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=747.08s)]
*  own right. I wonder if you could explain a little bit more about that and also maybe how treatments [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=752.84s)]
*  can progress from pain management to pain resolution? Yeah absolutely so in doing so I'll [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=759.8s)]
*  talk a bit about our platform as well kind of the underlying philosophy that we have at [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=766.68s)]
*  Dolaromics if that works for you. Sure. When we are looking at developing new treatments [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  this goes back to my previous answer about identifying novel targets and really understanding [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=780.68s)]
*  what is actually causing that initial transduction event to occur. We take an approach here that [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  our core belief is these nociceptive neurons are innervating all the tissues in our body and in [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=795.4s)]
*  doing so they're interacting with almost every other cell type in your body. We can take the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=802.12s)]
*  example of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis where they have pain in their left knee joint [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=807.48s)]
*  that is persistent and by all means is chronic in the definition. Here in the United States I believe [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=815.88s)]
*  that there are more than 15 different approved FDA therapeutics for the treatment of rheumatoid [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=822.36s)]
*  arthritis. What we see in patients who receive those FDA approved treatments for rheumatoid [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=828.92s)]
*  arthritis is that while the treatments themselves are remarkably successful at treating the RA [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=835.32s)]
*  itself and patients are able to be considered in remission of rheumatoid arthritis, oftentimes in [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=844.04s)]
*  a substantial population of those patients you actually have the persistence of pain even once [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=851.56s)]
*  a patient has gone into remission. Meaning the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=857.88s)]
*  have resolved, they are no longer present, the synovium itself which is the tissue in that knee [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=865.64s)]
*  joint has returned to a baseline state. At the same time the patients continue to feel [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=872.6s)]
*  pain in that joint area that impacts their day-to-day life. So what we do here at Doloromics [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=881.56s)]
*  is we use those omics technologies, things like single cell transcriptomics, to actually profile [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=889.72s)]
*  tissue from those patients and identify what signals have changed between say fibroblasts [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=896.76s)]
*  or macrophages in that tissue compartment in those patients. In doing so identifying which of those [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=903.4s)]
*  signals, these can be things like secreted ligands that are signaling to various different receptors [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=910.92s)]
*  on the nerve fibers themselves of the nociceptors, we identify those ligand receptor interactions [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=916.92s)]
*  and then take a step of trying to either resolve or remove those signals and in doing so aim to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=924.92s)]
*  return the pain itself to a resolution state. So that was a bit of a word salad or a bit of a jumble, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=935.4s)]
*  hopefully not too much or hopefully you were able to follow along. But I think kind of what that idea [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=942.52s)]
*  tries to encapsulate is that oftentimes when we are treating traditional diseases like rheumatoid [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=947.4799999999999s)]
*  or osteoarthritis or any other number of inflammatory diseases or conditions like fibromyalgia, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=954.28s)]
*  oftentimes now we are able to better treat the disease itself but the pain persists. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=961.4s)]
*  And so while maybe it's not exactly correct to think of chronic pain as a disease itself, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  I think that we need to address the fact that when we are treating these diseases we also need to [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=976.28s)]
*  have the capacity to treat the pain and oftentimes that relies on focusing or identifying [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=984.68s)]
*  different mechanisms that are driving the persistence of pain. You mentioned already what [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=991.56s)]
*  some of the other approaches are, I wonder if you could maybe, seen as some of them are quite [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=997.16s)]
*  interesting, if you could explain the VX548? Yeah, so that's the compound that Vertex has [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1003.0s)]
*  launched now through phase three clinical trials I believe and been publishing data about and I [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1013.32s)]
*  think is going to bring enormous relief to a substantial patient population. So we mentioned [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1019.72s)]
*  that those first two steps of nociception are transduction of signals and transmission. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1026.12s)]
*  I assume that most of your audience will probably be familiar with the idea of neurons [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  communicating with each other by generating action potentials. So these are electrical signals [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1037.56s)]
*  that travel down the axon to the synapse and relay that electrical signal to another neuron [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1042.76s)]
*  at the most basic high level. What Vertex has done and really cracked the code with in an area [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1051.64s)]
*  that others have before them have tried as well is to develop small molecule inhibitors for a [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1058.68s)]
*  specific sodium channel known as NAV1.8 that is pretty highly expressed on nociceptors in peripheral [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1065.4s)]
*  sensory neurons. The idea behind these therapeutics is that when somebody is in chronic pain the [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1075.0800000000002s)]
*  nociceptors themselves become hyper excitable, they fire more frequently. That's kind of the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1082.04s)]
*  underlying basis for their approach as well as our own approach at Dolaromics. We're addressing [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1087.08s)]
*  neuronal hyper excitability. Where our company is diverged is Vertex is developing these NAV1.8 [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1092.52s)]
*  inhibitors that show a remarkable ability to actually dampen that signal from being generated [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1100.12s)]
*  and kind of return those nociceptors back to a baseline. So what their small molecules do is [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  they actually block those ion channels and in doing so stop that actual nociception to higher [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1114.68s)]
*  brain regions. I think what their clinical trials have shown is that by addressing nociception at [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1122.44s)]
*  the periphery you can address that sensation of pain and chronic pain in patients which is a [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1127.88s)]
*  remarkable proof of concept for the field itself. They're certainly not the first to do so but they've [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1135.3200000000002s)]
*  had some amazing clinical success so far. Where our paths diverge though is like I said, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1140.4399999999998s)]
*  they're addressing really that ability of nociceptors to fire right away. What our [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1147.08s)]
*  therapeutics are aiming to do instead is to look at the signals that are actually causing the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1153.3999999999999s)]
*  nociceptors to fire more frequently. So we are identifying things like cytokines that traditionally [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1159.4799999999998s)]
*  haven't been known to signal through nociceptors and really understanding their physiology and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1166.76s)]
*  their ability to drive both an acute response where the nociceptor fires more frequently in [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1173.0s)]
*  response to a cytokine binding its cognitive receptor on the nociceptor as well as what [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1178.04s)]
*  causes that persistent positive feedback loop that leads to the nociceptor becoming hyper excitable [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1185.0s)]
*  and persisting in that chronic pain state. What about the use of monoclonal antibodies against [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1193.08s)]
*  CGRP and its receptor? Yeah absolutely. So there's a number of players in the CGRP field now [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1202.36s)]
*  both on the monoclonal antibodies and there's also several small molecule inhibitors for the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1209.24s)]
*  receptor itself that are clinically approved now. I think these really encapsulate our approach at [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  Dolaromics a little bit better than the NAP channel approaches that others are taking. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1221.64s)]
*  What I would say there is kind of backing up a step. So CGRP or calcitonin gene related peptide [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1227.16s)]
*  is a neuropeptide and when it is released from neurons it causes a potent vasodilation and while [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1234.76s)]
*  there is an enormous breadth of research in the role of vasodilation in conditions like migraine, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1244.92s)]
*  at the same time I would say that that story isn't fully understood just yet. But what is shown is [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1253.0s)]
*  that in these patients who have previously had treatment resistant migraines that the CGRP [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1258.92s)]
*  antibodies are remarkably successful in being used as a preventative measure. So when we think about [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1265.64s)]
*  migraine and migraine treatments we can think about treatments as either being preventative [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1273.96s)]
*  where we have to take them quarterly or weekly or bi-weekly depending on what the dosing schedule [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1278.8400000000001s)]
*  the therapeutic is to stop the migraine from actually on setting and we can also think about [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1284.04s)]
*  migraine treatments as abortive. So once you have a migraine you're able to take that treatment. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1289.16s)]
*  The CGRP antibodies are typically preventative. They're not going to be able to resolve a migraine [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1294.04s)]
*  once it's actually set in in a patient. That said these kind of pave the way in my mind for [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1301.0s)]
*  developing a precision medicine approach to treating different types of pain like migraine. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1307.56s)]
*  Fundamentally if we kind of take a 40,000 foot look at these treatments and what the idea behind it is [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  is that if we remove a signal we are able to stop the pain, in this case migraine, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1323.08s)]
*  from on setting and I think that's just a remarkable advance for the field at this point. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  I guess this is kind of taking a step back a little bit but how [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1337.1599999999999s)]
*  have recent advances in genomic technologies advanced the understanding of pain? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1341.0s)]
*  Yeah so I'll speak for ourselves. Fundamentally they've allowed us to understand human biology [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1347.24s)]
*  to a greater degree. Even when I was in undergrad which wasn't too long ago or maybe I'm just kidding [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1354.1200000000001s)]
*  myself there, we had very limited abilities to actually profile the wide range of receptors [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1361.0800000000002s)]
*  that these human nociceptors expressed. You could pick a few and perform either flow cytometry or [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1370.2s)]
*  an IHC experiment in stained populations of cells to identify various different potential drug targets [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1378.6000000000001s)]
*  that they may express. What we're able to do now particularly with technologies such as single cell [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1385.88s)]
*  transcriptomics is to take every cell in a given tissue and fully understand its molecular [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1392.2s)]
*  landscape. This allows us not just to look and see whether a drug target is expressed in a given [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1400.52s)]
*  tissue or not but to actually understand better how these cellular populations differentiate from [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1407.72s)]
*  one another and how they may then be differentially affected by different types of disease. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1415.64s)]
*  In the role of what we're interested in, sensory neurons, nociceptors, we're able to take human [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1422.2s)]
*  dorsal reganglion and then using these advances in omics technologies take the tissue, dissociate it, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1428.68s)]
*  sequence it, and then categorize and characterize all the different populations of nociceptors. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1436.2s)]
*  And that's really important because different populations of nociceptors play different roles [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1443.24s)]
*  in our perception of the world around us. Nociceptors are not a kind of generic one-size-fits-all [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1449.56s)]
*  class of neuron where they're all conveying the same information about the world around us. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1456.9199999999998s)]
*  You have nociceptors that convey things like temperature, nociceptors that convey mechanical [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1461.1599999999999s)]
*  responses, and you have nociceptors that can convey things like chemical responses, again, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1468.36s)]
*  more looking at being able to perceive things like tissue damage or inflammation. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1474.6799999999998s)]
*  A really nice example of this is a population of nociceptors which sense temperature and express [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1480.6s)]
*  markers like trypimate, a ion channel known to transmit the sensation of colder temperatures. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1488.12s)]
*  These populations of cells are fundamentally affected in treatments such as chemotherapies [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1495.96s)]
*  for other diseases. What that causes then is that patients undergoing chemotherapy oftentimes [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1505.56s)]
*  develop cold hypersensitivities which on its face just seems like an inability to [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1513.8799999999999s)]
*  really withstand touching cold things. But it's actually much more severe than that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1521.24s)]
*  Individuals who are undergoing chemotherapy and develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1528.28s)]
*  oftentimes develop these cold hypersensitivities wherein after receiving their chemotherapy, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1534.84s)]
*  they go to their fridge to get out a can of Diet Coke or another drink or something like that, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1540.1999999999998s)]
*  and they touch the can and initially it's painful and they're unable to really hold it and they put [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1545.56s)]
*  it back in the fridge. But what that actually leads to is a longer sensation of pain in that [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1550.2s)]
*  affected area because those thermoreceptors, those cold sensing nociceptors are hyper excitable and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1558.1200000000001s)]
*  the insult of chemotherapy that is driving that painful phenotype is then leading to a [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1566.2s)]
*  hypersensitivity when the patient engages in their environment and tries to go about their [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1575.24s)]
*  day-to-day life. You've already mentioned the Dolores platform. I wonder if you could go into [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1580.6s)]
*  a little bit more detail about how it works and your approach to treating pain. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1585.64s)]
*  So Dolores as a platform has both an in silico and in in vitro or ex vivo portion of it. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1592.92s)]
*  Where we begin with on that in silico portion of the platform is taking human tissue, again, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1600.2s)]
*  primarily dorsal ganglion or spinal cord. In addition to that, we're also obtaining tissue [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1606.44s)]
*  from I mentioned synovium from patients with various different types of arthritis. We also [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1611.8799999999999s)]
*  look at things like other peripheral nerves like serol or sciatic nerve from patients say with [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1617.24s)]
*  diabetic peripheral neuropathies. And what we do is we take all of these tissues and we profile [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1623.24s)]
*  them omically using again those same techniques that we've already talked about from bulk [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1629.88s)]
*  transcriptomics to single cell transcriptomics to proteomics and even looking at things like [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1635.16s)]
*  the epigenome through spatial attack sequencing or looking at microRNA regulation networks. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1641.4s)]
*  And in doing so, what we do is develop this comprehensive atlas or what we call nociceptive [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  cartography around the tissue in how our sensory tissue changes across various different types of [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1656.04s)]
*  disease. From there, we take a fairly involved computational approach to identify the signals [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1663.4799999999998s)]
*  between cells and within cells that are changing in leading to the nociceptors becoming hyper [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1670.76s)]
*  excitable, which is again kind of the key part or basis of the platform itself. We're trying to [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1677.0s)]
*  understand better what signals are not just changing, but what signals are leading to the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1683.56s)]
*  increase in excitability, which leads to the increase in transmission from the periphery to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1689.96s)]
*  the central nervous system. From there, we identify a typically short list of therapeutic targets [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1695.8s)]
*  that we want to validate in our wet lab. Traditionally, I'm sure most folks in the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1703.8s)]
*  delay audience will think of neuroscience drug development and picture a movie that they've [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1708.84s)]
*  watched or something similar and picture a scientist standing in a room of lab rats. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1715.56s)]
*  We take a human first and human to human approach in developing our therapeutics, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1721.48s)]
*  meaning as we move into the in vitro or ex vivo portion of our platform, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1728.9199999999998s)]
*  rather than relying on those traditional animal models, instead what we're doing is taking either [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1734.6799999999998s)]
*  the human primary tissue, so taking the human dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord that we [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1742.12s)]
*  are obtaining from organ donors, or taking IPSC derived sensory neurons. These are sensory neurons [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  that we're growing from induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiating into a mature sensory [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1754.36s)]
*  neuron phenotype. We use those for actually screening our therapeutic targets or the [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1760.4399999999998s)]
*  eventual drugs that we are developing themselves. To explain that maybe a little bit better, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1767.24s)]
*  what we're doing is we're taking traditional neuroscience approaches like running various [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1774.52s)]
*  electrophysiological assays, say plating cells on a microelectrode array, which allows us to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1779.96s)]
*  monitor the cell's firing rate. If we remember, the cell's action potential firing rate relates [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1786.9199999999998s)]
*  to their kind of state of excitability. So what we may see when we culture, say, human tissue [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1794.76s)]
*  on a microelectrode array is that at a steady state or baseline, it's fairly silent or not [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1802.9199999999998s)]
*  firing very often. However, when we add a given factor that our platform has identified, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1810.4399999999998s)]
*  we see that the signals increase, say in response to a growth factor that Dolores has nominated as [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1818.28s)]
*  being a key driver of chronic pain. And we add that exogenous growth factor to the cell's [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1824.84s)]
*  microenvironment, we see that the nociceptors or the sensory neurons increase their firing rate. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1833.3999999999999s)]
*  From there, what we can do is monitor how, not just the amount, but how long that [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1839.6399999999999s)]
*  pain phenotype persists and how it changes the underlying baseline of the tissue that [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1846.4399999999998s)]
*  we're working with. From there, we can take that next step of beginning to develop therapeutics, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1853.72s)]
*  which we can then again test in that same test system. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1859.16s)]
*  As far as delivery goes, what kind of delivery methods are you looking to? Or is that too far [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1863.32s)]
*  down the road? I wouldn't say it's too far down the road. I think it's important to always be [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1868.68s)]
*  keeping those things in mind as we start to develop therapeutics. So you'll see on our website that we [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1873.8s)]
*  have seven different therapeutic programs ongoing in various stages of development right now. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1879.88s)]
*  Those range from monoclonal antibodies to small molecule inhibitors or small molecule positive [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1885.72s)]
*  allosteric modulators or negative allosteric modulators. Really all to say that we are a bit [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1893.3200000000002s)]
*  modality agnostic at Doloromics. The team itself has a deep expertise in neuroscience and in drug [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1900.1200000000001s)]
*  development, particularly my co-founder Chris Flores, who's an industry veteran of 20 years [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1907.48s)]
*  at J&J. We rely on the team to identify the best therapeutic modality to address a given target [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1913.32s)]
*  that is nominated by Dolores. When it comes to things like delivery routes, obviously that will [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1921.08s)]
*  depend on what that end chemical matter is. For something like a monoclonal antibody, it may make [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1927.64s)]
*  sense to do a more localized infusion or injection, particularly in cases where the pain itself is [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1933.48s)]
*  more localized to a given compartment of the body. But at the same time, it may prove out that based [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1944.2s)]
*  on the pharmacokinetics of whatever therapeutics we end up developing may be amenable to a systemic [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1949.8s)]
*  administration as well. And I guess one of the other things that is associated with, especially [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1955.64s)]
*  with pain treatments, is cost. Is that something that's on your radar as to how to keep costs down? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1961.16s)]
*  Absolutely. So our CEO, Lucas Rodriguez, is really fond of saying when we look at traditional [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1969.5600000000002s)]
*  treatments, things like opioids, that opioids have a place in pain treatment. That place just isn't [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1977.0s)]
*  in our medicine cabinet at home. I think that is important when thinking about things like cost. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1983.8000000000002s)]
*  Particularly here in the U.S., we do have to keep in mind that while we could develop the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1991.3200000000002s)]
*  greatest therapeutics for treating pain itself, we still need to be able to address the fact that [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=1997.4s)]
*  likely therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies will cost more than a traditional opioid. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2004.2s)]
*  The hope here is that we will be able to demonstrate that our therapeutics will be disease [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2012.0400000000002s)]
*  modifying and will lead to pain resolution rather than just treating that symptomology of pain. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2018.2s)]
*  I believe if we're able to do that, we will be able to justify those costs associated with [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2026.52s)]
*  development of various different things like biologics. And so what are the next steps for [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2032.28s)]
*  the company in terms of clinical trials? Our lead asset right now is really approaching IND. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2038.44s)]
*  I believe that you can draw up the natural time course from there when we should ideally be [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2046.2s)]
*  entering clinical trials with that lead asset, but our other assets as well are starting to [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2051.88s)]
*  approach IND, particularly some of our monoclonal antibodies. So as a company, particularly as a [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2056.2799999999997s)]
*  small biotech, and I'll be a little bit more cagey here in my response, we'll focus on developing [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2062.84s)]
*  our therapeutics likely up to a stage where we can then partner them with larger pharmaceutical [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2069.32s)]
*  companies just because we really believe our expertise is in identifying non-therapeutic [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2074.44s)]
*  targets and developing initial chemical matter around them. That said, I don't see us ever really [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2079.96s)]
*  going into those late stage clinical trials, things like phase three clinical trials, rather [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2087.32s)]
*  instead I think we have a lot more strength in developing earlier stages and then partnering [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2092.2000000000003s)]
*  for later stages. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2097.0s)]
*  Pretty much everything you needed to know about the treatment of pain there, definitely an [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2097.88s)]
*  interesting subject of study and good to see new treatments in development. Don't forget to check [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2108.36s)]
*  out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu and I hope wherever in the world you are, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2114.92s)]
*  you have a great week ahead. Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us again next time for [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2122.44s)]
*  another Beyond Biotech. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QomTnRqjQ&t=2128.04s)]
