Video Description: June is myasthenia gravis awareness month. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder where antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, and this results in weakness of the skeletal muscles. 


It especially affects the voluntary muscles of the eyes, mouth, throat and/or limbs. It is most frequent in women from 20 and 30 and men aged 50 and older. 


To talk about the disease, how it is being treated, and what is in the pipeline for future treatments, we had a conversation with Dana Vigier, head of Central Eastern and Northern Europe at Alexion.

# How biotech is tackling myasthenia gravis
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 96. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. June is Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month and so we thought it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=16.48s)]
*  would be a good opportunity to see what's happening with respect to tackling the disease. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=24.18s)]
*  It's a chronic autoimmune disorder where antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=30.1s)]
*  muscle and that results in weakness of the skeletal muscles. It especially affects the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=36.86s)]
*  voluntary muscles of the eyes, mouth, throat and limbs and it's most frequent in women [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=43.22s)]
*  from the ages of 20 to 30 and men aged 50 and older. To talk about the disease and how it is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=49.54s)]
*  being treated we had a conversation with Dana Vigier, Head of Central Eastern and Northern [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=57.18s)]
*  Europe at Alexion. Alright, hi Dana. I wonder if you could give me a bit of background on what you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=64.18s)]
*  do. I'm VP heading up the Central and North European countries for Alexion for about a year [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=72.3s)]
*  now. I used to be a doctor, GP by training, worked in pharma for ages, the last eight years [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  probably in oncology and then I joined AstraZeneca in oncology by the way. Alright, how are you [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  finding it so far? Oh I find it fascinating. Rare diseases is a very special space, very very [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=91.46s)]
*  special space and very emotional space but also you know sort of taking us back to realities of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=98.58s)]
*  how come that we can still have patients who take five years to diagnostic. That's the former [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=105.82s)]
*  doctor that speaks here and the fascinating part is this translation of science really into [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=113.06s)]
*  medicine for like 7,000 rare diseases is like a huge number, multiplying a very small number of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=119.06s)]
*  people suffering from each of those and making it a very difficult game for doctors. So I find it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=129.62s)]
*  absolutely amazing and I think Alexion is an amazingly positioned company for that. As you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=136.58s)]
*  mentioned that you were previously a doctor, are a lot of these diseases very difficult to diagnose? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=142.06s)]
*  They are very difficult to diagnose and you know what when you consider that there are 400 million [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  people around the world who are suffering from about 7,000 rare disease, different rare diseases [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  right and about 90% of those have absolutely no therapeutic solution anyway and most of them but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  not all are genetic and we don't know much about them is a hugely complex area for multiple reasons. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=167.78s)]
*  Complex area first of all to sort of understand the physiology, the pathophysiology of the disease. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  Second is to try and obviously develop drugs so the R&D process is extremely difficult [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=182.54s)]
*  in rare diseases but then it is difficult to diagnose for a poor GP as I used to be because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=190.3s)]
*  they present in multiple non-specific forms. So you will have a person coming in and coming with [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=199.02s)]
*  very non-specific symptoms and we're trained to go towards the most prevalent diseases. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  So if somebody comes to a doctor and just sort of signals fatigue before thinking about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  myasthenia bravis for instance you're going to think about about 10 other things that are much [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=222.33999999999997s)]
*  more common and that is the other element so after difficult R&D, very difficult diagnostic [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=227.62s)]
*  and then the whole system, the whole healthcare system in all our western countries by the way [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=237.3s)]
*  certainly mine is not necessarily built for that so the referral system, the expertise centers, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=243.38s)]
*  the guidelines, the value assessment, the access to drugs, nothing is built for them. So there is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=251.38s)]
*  a lot of work and collaborative work to be done across all stakeholders at each and every step there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=259.06s)]
*  Could you give me a little bit of a background on myasthenia gravis? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=266.58s)]
*  Totally so. So myasthenia gravis is one of the diseases that election is focused on and it's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=272.18s)]
*  one of those chronic progressive diseases and it's an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. So the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=280.66s)]
*  problem at the end of the day as you certainly know is at the neuromuscular junction you need [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=289.06s)]
*  a neurotransmitter to be able to sort of actually get the muscle to contract and there is a point [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=295.86s)]
*  in time in this disease where basically there is a disruption there and muscles do not contract [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=304.26s)]
*  anymore. It just affects approximately 20 people in 100,000 which is not an ultra rare disease but [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  it's still a very typical rare disease obviously. For reasons we don't know it affects mostly women [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  before their 40s and men mostly after their 60s and again they're present with quite [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=329.29999999999995s)]
*  non-specific and surprising symptoms. Slurred speech, choking, first with problems with [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=335.46s)]
*  the eye muscles, the eyelids drop, shortness of breath is the more severe area and then when it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=342.5s)]
*  starts affecting as you might imagine the breathing muscles, the chokes, that's when it starts getting [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=353.22s)]
*  really serious and then really dangerous and then you have those myasthenic crisis that take people [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=361.14000000000004s)]
*  to hospital basically and intensive care and that basically is what you really don't want to happen. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=368.18s)]
*  So it's this whole range of symptoms and evolution that defines myasthenia gravis and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=375.22s)]
*  basically there is if I go quickly on that about 80 percent of people have an acetylcholine receptor [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=383.3s)]
*  antibody. So it's an autoimmune antibody so something that turns against something in your [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=392.1s)]
*  own immune system that turns against your own protein, your own enzymes and destroys them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=398.1s)]
*  So that is the core of the reason why Alexion has expanded its development, very difficult to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=405.22s)]
*  bend in this particular area as well because it exploits the principle of the complement system [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=413.86s)]
*  and the complement is one of the multiple elements of our innate immune systems. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=420.82000000000005s)]
*  What's the prognosis for somebody that has been diagnosed with the condition? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=427.38000000000005s)]
*  Basically the condition can evolve over many years, many many years and you'll have most of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=432.42s)]
*  people who are after a few years until they get diagnosed but once they're diagnosed they will [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=439.06s)]
*  respond to relatively traditional therapies if you want like mestinol and acetylcholine receptor [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=445.22s)]
*  activator, they will respond to corticosteroids or to immunosuppressants but then you'll have about [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=451.94s)]
*  10 to 15 percent of patients basically who actually do not respond to that, do not respond [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=458.82s)]
*  anymore to that and that is when they get into this risk of myasthenic crisis and we go then to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  the second level medications which will basically for instance include the complement, the C5 [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=473.38s)]
*  medication so where Alexion sort of opened up the trail back in 2007 with the first sort of complement [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=479.06s)]
*  5 inhibitor which was soliris and then went into ultramiris later on which is a long acting one to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=486.9s)]
*  protect people on the long longer term and basically that again as you might imagine [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  acts in terms of blocking inhibiting this excessive complement activation. Do you know [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=503.62s)]
*  why it's called complement? It basically so this thing is what's a complement basically [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=509.94s)]
*  it's a system of about 50 plasma proteins that activate each other like a domino and they [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=515.06s)]
*  complement in a way our antibodies which need this complement to basically kill the microbes [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=522.7399999999999s)]
*  and by extension they will kill anything that is perceived as being non-self so that you don't [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=531.54s)]
*  wreck your body doesn't recognize anymore as self as being self and that the complement will [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=537.4599999999999s)]
*  actually at the end of the day will be marking them for destruction and if that mechanism goes [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=543.38s)]
*  wild and is not inhibited anymore that's for instance when it destroys acetylcholine enzymes [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=551.06s)]
*  and will get your myasthenia gravis just worse and worse so giving that complement that's a C5 [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=558.42s)]
*  inhibition which is the terminal when you have that domino effect it inhibits the last bit of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=566.98s)]
*  it so it stops the whole event from actually destroying the cell so it's a difficult disease [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=573.3s)]
*  to treat but all these diseases are. The current treatments how effective though and how do they [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=579.86s)]
*  work? So there are multiple mechanisms of action so as I said basically when you have the guidelines [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=586.9s)]
*  the current guidelines are very much going first to relatively traditional and historical medicines [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=593.06s)]
*  like mestinon which allows acetylcholine to remain in the neuromuscular junction. Most people react [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=600.18s)]
*  well to that for quite a long time. Other treatments are corticosteroids as you know [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  corticosteroids inhibit inflammation so they stop the inflammation. Immunosuppressant agents like [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=613.2199999999999s)]
*  cells have to be around whatever so these are like all kinds of different ways of attacking [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=620.66s)]
*  the immune system at the very beginning at one basic level I would say but then you'll have [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=626.5799999999999s)]
*  these new treatment much more sophisticated I would say like the C5 inhibitors starting with [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=635.06s)]
*  Sleris, which was FDA approved already back in 2007 but now Ultimaris approved in 2018 [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=642.5s)]
*  and which is this long-acting inhibition you block the last moment the last element of the complement [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=651.54s)]
*  domino and do not allow it to eat up the enzyme but it's not the only one there are others obviously [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=659.9399999999999s)]
*  so Argenics has another drug approved which is Vivgard then there is a Bristigo approved as well [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=668.42s)]
*  for the treatment of GMG so it's just a lot of science and a lot of companies at the end of the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=676.26s)]
*  day who are now following the path that has been opened there on this C5 inhibition and this [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=683.4599999999999s)]
*  particular element of the immune system. Do all of the drugs work in a similar way? Some are slightly [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  different some are adding up so as you probably know now that you haven't been interviewing and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=697.14s)]
*  discussing with so many people working in this area I mean immunology is probably one of the most [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=703.62s)]
*  complex areas so you'll just our immunological system is so incredibly complex that you can [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=709.14s)]
*  tackle multiple different cascades if you want of activation so most of them will now follow what [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  will follow this path of the complement inhibition because it is a very effective [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=726.26s)]
*  it has been proven to be a very effective pass but then for instance even Alexia now so we just got [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=730.98s)]
*  FDA, EMEA and Japan approval for Voidea which is a factor D now what is factor D factor D inhibition [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=737.6999999999999s)]
*  is one again element that will actually add on to the complement C5 inhibition to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=748.58s)]
*  strengthen that inhibition even more so so you will have a lot of pathways but once we open up [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=757.22s)]
*  one of those pathways in the immune sort of system most next drugs will actually look into that and [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=764.74s)]
*  try and work as much as possible on it until another path is open. What kind of R&D is happening [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=771.62s)]
*  in the field? There is a lot of these efforts of trying to work around the complement system but [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=780.26s)]
*  not only now there are new areas as well which is for instance you will have the B-cell depletion [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=788.9s)]
*  treatments that we are involved in as well, neonatal FCA receptor antagonists we also look [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=796.34s)]
*  there is a huge trend in T-cell directed treatments that's another element of the immunological [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=803.7800000000001s)]
*  action in a completely different area obviously companies like Janssen are evaluating medications [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=811.22s)]
*  like Nibcalimab, Roche is investigating Satralizumab, Regeneron is investigating Bezalimab, I mean there's [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=818.02s)]
*  a number of drugs there and that is also a testimony of this I would say this incredibly [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=825.6999999999999s)]
*  difficult way to develop these drugs because it takes a lot of effort to find these patients to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=834.7399999999999s)]
*  be able to treat these patients properly to standardize development in these patients so [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=843.3s)]
*  just as an example if you want in terms of doing R&D the importance of getting the patient insight [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=850.74s)]
*  and understanding truly the dynamic of the disease from the patient is absolutely critical [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=856.8199999999999s)]
*  and that's when you sort of just to give you a benchmark if you want when you work in oncology [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=864.26s)]
*  as in R&D and oncology as I used to for a number of years you'll have MRIs or scans that will [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=870.02s)]
*  absolutely tell you that tumor diminished or did not diminish and that's very simple very objective [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=878.9s)]
*  very quick to identify not that the general symptomatology of cancer is not important but [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=886.26s)]
*  at the end of the day it's about shrinking up that tumor in diseases like GMG there is nothing [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=893.06s)]
*  completely objective that you can base on everything is in the patient's expression of disease of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=899.38s)]
*  symptomatology of problems and that is incredibly difficult to standardize and this is one of the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=907.22s)]
*  things that we are very keen to work on this is why when you ask me how it is it was Alexian [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=915.0600000000001s)]
*  nowadays I think that this is one of the things so there are two things I'm fascinated about [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=921.3000000000001s)]
*  one is the science in Alexian and one is I've hardly seen so much patient focus and listening [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=925.46s)]
*  and I understand now why because this is the truly only way to sort of move forward with [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=933.78s)]
*  effective therapies and let me tell you the example for that for me that was an eye-opener really [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=940.18s)]
*  we did in Switzerland which is one of the countries I'm looking after we did in Switzerland a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=946.66s)]
*  collaborative study involving a survey involving both patients and doctors in terms of assessing [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=951.54s)]
*  the symptoms of the given patients and I'm still very impressed with two results there are many [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=960.5s)]
*  results obviously but there are two results that I'm very impressed with one is and you asked me [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=967.62s)]
*  about the effectiveness or the efficacy of the treatments one is that about 83 percent of patients [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=972.3399999999999s)]
*  still report significant symptoms even under treatment I mean under current traditional [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=980.26s)]
*  treatment right that is quite staggering I would say I mean one would wonder why don't they move [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=986.58s)]
*  on to the next level of treatment and then this the second part if you want is quite interesting [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=993.7800000000001s)]
*  it is about 43 percent of patients disagreed with the assessment of their disease that was done by [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=999.94s)]
*  their doctors so they felt that that did not adequately reflect the size and the depth of [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1008.74s)]
*  their symptoms and that to us truly a wake-up call and to me specifically as a former doctor [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1015.62s)]
*  and I think that that is the one thing that we need to work with as well in R&D but not only [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1021.94s)]
*  also in the way that we are actually working with and collaborating with doctors with value assessors [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1029.7s)]
*  across the countries as reimbursement systems to make sure that this vision is actually truly [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1038.5s)]
*  embedded and not diminished I would say we're not understood I'll give you another example there [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1045.94s)]
*  which did strike me in terms of questions there are two types of questionnaire let's put it this [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1052.18s)]
*  way to assess the disease in GMG and one is patient reported and one is physician assessed [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1057.86s)]
*  and they both have for instance a question around swallowing because choking is an important symptom [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1068.74s)]
*  and there is one question which is do you have troubles swallowing and basically the patient [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1077.14s)]
*  in the study asked this way said well no I'm fine and then in the patient reported one there is also [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1084.26s)]
*  a question that is the complement question which is when was the last time you had a stick [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1093.38s)]
*  and then the patient answers well no I'm not having sticks I can't chew them so this is an [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1099.7800000000002s)]
*  eye-opener it's like little stories tell us much more than a lot of studies we need to listen more [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1107.14s)]
*  and better to patients. Could you tell me a little bit about the company and what you're doing to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1113.46s)]
*  tackle nicely new crevice? Alexia was founded in 1992 in Connecticut and now 30 years later is [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1118.9s)]
*  employing about 3,800 people talking about the R&D talking about the rapid expansion across the world [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1129.3000000000002s)]
*  and delivers slightly less than eight billion dollars a year and what that success was made [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1137.5400000000002s)]
*  of is really it started with the complement system so particularly with this C5 so translating this [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1145.46s)]
*  biology into an actual drug. Celeris was launched in 2007 then there was a second launch aside from [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1152.58s)]
*  from C5 so this company was not only a C5 company it did launch the Aspartase Alpha [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1161.38s)]
*  which is called Schrenzig in genetic hypophosphatase 2008 then it acquired [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1168.82s)]
*  Alexin acquired silent JIVA 2015 and launched Canuma for LAL deficiency yet another rare disease [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1176.74s)]
*  and developed progressively and vastly about four different indications for the C5 complement [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1186.1799999999998s)]
*  inhibitors Celeris and Ultramaris which are PNH in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, AHS [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1193.46s)]
*  atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, NMOSD neuromyelitis, Optica disorder and last but not [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1202.42s)]
*  least the GMG we're talking about so the general miastinia gravis and then in what was it July 21 [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1210.1000000000001s)]
*  Alexin was actually acquired by AstraZeneca and now is striving to develop massively and use also [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1218.1000000000001s)]
*  the AstraZeneca muscle to be able to expand access to rare diseases in new countries so it's expanding [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1227.0600000000002s)]
*  its geography massively and I didn't tell you that actually there was an interesting it's not [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1235.5400000000002s)]
*  finished there because in 2023 because that is part that fascinates me as well so [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1241.54s)]
*  2023 the company acquired actually Pfizer's pre-clinical gene therapy portfolio [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1247.46s)]
*  and that is going to be the next step chapter of the R&D and basically the development part [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1253.94s)]
*  so gene therapy development very strongly focusing on rare diseases from here onwards [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1260.5s)]
*  and other types of deals acquired from other biotechs like amylet for instance this year. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1267.7s)]
*  Are you working currently on any clinical trials related to GMG? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1274.1s)]
*  We do have several clinical trials actually in GMG some already on I mean still on Celeris [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1278.82s)]
*  and Ultramaris but also on Alexin 2050 which is an investigational therapy and [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1286.9s)]
*  as also discussed I told you about Voidea which is in full launch right now so the factor D [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1295.7800000000002s)]
*  that comes with the complement and we now also work in key areas as you know like research on [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1301.8600000000001s)]
*  GMG on B-cell depletion treatments on T-cell directed treatments so there are multiple areas [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1310.02s)]
*  so yes this is a continuous active area of development. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1317.14s)]
*  June is GMG month what is the importance of having awareness months in some of these rare diseases? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1321.38s)]
*  Yes we know of course that there are a lot of awareness days and months lately in many diseases [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1330.5800000000002s)]
*  and in many areas by the way not only in diseases but I think raising awareness of GMG is [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1337.14s)]
*  particularly important first of all for GMG patients those who know themselves and who [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1343.7s)]
*  ignore themselves for their families for their carers and as you know I personally believe that [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1349.3s)]
*  maybe the biggest importance of this awareness month is raising awareness towards healthcare [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1356.82s)]
*  practitioners across the GPs like I used to be as I said I mean it is so important at this stage [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1365.62s)]
*  to make sure that we collectively by this awareness effort but not only can really try and shorten this [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1374.1799999999998s)]
*  far too long diagnostic errands for patients five years on average for rare diseases in general and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1383.3s)]
*  GMG as well to a diagnostic is like not acceptable I would say in our systems. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1392.02s)]
*  Awareness is the first and foremost critical path we can think of many others we can think of digital [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1397.7s)]
*  we're working a lot in that we can think of artificial intentions we are exploring any [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1406.42s)]
*  single possible route to collaborate with other stakeholders in the healthcare systems because we [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1412.98s)]
*  can't do it all obviously but certainly collaborate and create coalitions to make sure that we use the [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1420.26s)]
*  technology that is available to help and support patient groups and individual patients basically [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1427.22s)]
*  in GMG and in the other rare diseases we're looking at. Would improving diagnosis and [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1434.1s)]
*  getting earlier diagnosis improve the prognosis for people with GMG? It would certainly improve [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1441.62s)]
*  their lives that's our mission is to transform rare disease people's lives not all diseases are [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1449.38s)]
*  lethal so you're not going to die necessarily or if treated you're not going to die later [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1456.5800000000002s)]
*  but basically these are chronic diseases chronic diseases means living for years with a disease [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1462.9s)]
*  your quality of life the way you're living and of course on the other hand as well the burden on [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1470.9s)]
*  the healthcare system but first and foremost the quality of life of these patients and their carers [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1476.98s)]
*  is the most important action that we can sort of undertake to make sure that we transform their [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1484.26s)]
*  lives so yes when you see basically the responses of and the quotes of these GMG patients whose daily [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1491.3000000000002s)]
*  activities are completely hampered they just don't do anything I mean when you listen to them [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1501.22s)]
*  it's like even cutting a slice of bread is well forget about it I'm not doing it it's exhausting [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1509.38s)]
*  and I'm not even talking about the myasthenia crisis I'm just talking about the everyday symptoms [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1516.9s)]
*  making life unbearable for these patients so yes having a diagnostic earlier allows treatment [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1522.82s)]
*  earlier that is the most important part and with the current drugs in development and the clinical [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1528.74s)]
*  trials are you hopeful that people with GMG will be able to live better lives in the future well [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1535.6200000000001s)]
*  we definitely believe that even with the existing drugs so this is one of the reasons behind the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1544.42s)]
*  success of election for instance is the fact that current drugs are already seeing a transformation [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1550.26s)]
*  in people's lives and that is truly what motivates us every day of course we need more of course we [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1560.18s)]
*  will do more and this is what we do in in R&D when we went as well from a very efficacious [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1567.14s)]
*  solaris for instance to a very efficacious ultramaries but which on top of solaris [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1573.86s)]
*  increased even further the quality of life of people because of this long acting treatment so [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1581.62s)]
*  they didn't need to have it so often and just they could rely on the effective treatment for much [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1586.82s)]
*  longer these are incremental steps towards not only this efficiency but also maximizing that's [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1592.5s)]
*  our aim again transforming patients lives making sure that we can hear them and get even better in [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1601.62s)]
*  the treatment to get their lives better is there anything else that you wanted to talk about that [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1609.62s)]
*  we didn't cover i think we discussed a lot about GMG and this is great and i think that it's one [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1615.06s)]
*  of the important parts for our focus in R&D and commercialization in ensuring access and that is [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1621.9399999999998s)]
*  probably the only last thing i would like to say is how important and this is what my teams across [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1630.1s)]
*  the countries in europe are doing every day is the importance of truly partnering every single day [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1637.06s)]
*  with patient advocacies healthcare providers payers and even on the broader side the local societies [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1644.5s)]
*  to make sure that whatever we do and we come up with from our R&D these drugs only work [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1652.26s)]
*  if they reach every patient and no patient is left behind so our job is to work collaboratively to [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1659.46s)]
*  make sure that patients do have access to these drugs as soon as possible so that keeps us awake [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1666.8200000000002s)]
*  at night i know there are an awful lot of awareness days and months especially this time of year [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  but the organizers of them do some great work increasing awareness raising funds and coordinating [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1685.22s)]
*  research so let's hope there are some more major advancements in tackling myasthenia gravis soon [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1692.5s)]
*  as well as for some other rare diseases don't forget to check out the latest news and articles [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1699.54s)]
*  over at lebiotech.eu and i hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1705.38s)]
*  thanks for listening and i hope you'll join us again next time for another beyond biotech [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYPIxpYFF_w&t=1712.34s)]
