Video Description: CatalYm is preparing to initiate its broad phase 2b clinical development program for visugromab to tackle multiple solid tumor indications. 

Visugromab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the tumor-derived growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a locally acting immunosuppressant fostering immunotherapy resistance. 

Neutralizing GDF-15 with visugromab reverses key cancer resistance mechanisms to reinstate an efficient anti-tumor response by reenabling immune cell activation, proliferation and Interferon-γ signature induction. 

Visugromab has demonstrated a good safety profile and potent and durable anti-tumor efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment in advanced cancer patients, as highlighted in its recent Nature publication and interim clinical data. 

This week we have a conversation with Eugen Leo, chief medical officer at CatalYm.

*  with Catalym, whose lead candidate Vizugramab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=63.04s)]
*  tumor-derived growth differentiation factor 15, a locally acting immunosuppressant fostering [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=71.16s)]
*  immunotherapy resistance. To tell us more we have a conversation with Eugen Leo, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Chief Medical Officer at Catalym. To get started with the interview I wonder if you could first [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=85.04s)]
*  tell us a little bit about the company. Yes I'm very happy to do so Jim. Catalym is developing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=93.56s)]
*  Vizugramab, a first-in-class anti-GDF15 antibody in solid tumors. We identified a new role for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=99.48s)]
*  GDF15 as a locally acting immunosuppressant which is secreted by tumor cells fostering [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=107.96s)]
*  immunotherapy resistance. These initial findings were published in Nature Communications in 2023. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=115.08s)]
*  In our first in-human phase 1-2a study, which is called Godfather 1 trial, Vizugramab in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  combination with anti-PD-1 treatment demonstrated durable anti-tumor efficacy with deep and long [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=131.04s)]
*  lasting objective responses. In last line, anti-PD-1, PD-Ligand 1 relapsed and refractory [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=139.32s)]
*  metastatic solid tumor patients. In addition, data from the same study demonstrated that Vizugramab [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  can significantly counteract the effects of carrexia in these patients opening up further [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=153.52s)]
*  development considerations. The initial clinical data were recently published in Nature after [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  being presented at ASCO 2024 and the 2024 International Conference on Sarcopenia, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=167.28s)]
*  Carrexia and Wasting Disorders. Our company is based in Munich, Germany and San Francisco, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=174.12s)]
*  and is backed by leading international investors. We completed recently a successful $150 million [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=181.44s)]
*  series D financing in July. This latest financing will fund our broad phase 2b program that we are [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  currently unrolling in earlier treatment settings for non-small cell lung cancer and additional [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=197.88s)]
*  tumor indications, all hopefully launched within 2025. Based on the outcomes, we hope to bring this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=204.6s)]
*  quite promising new therapeutic concept to patients in need as soon as possible. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=212.68s)]
*  Before we get to talking about what you're doing in the space in a bit more detail, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=218.12s)]
*  I wonder if you could give us a bit of background perhaps on solid tumors and why they're so difficult to treat? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=222.56s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. While treatment of many hematologic malignancies has made significant [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=228.96s)]
*  progress in the past decades, the success rate for the treatment of solid tumors, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=237.16s)]
*  particularly in the metastatic setting, is still limited by several factors. First, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=242.56s)]
*  you face complex genetic alterations, often polyclonal disease, and various tactics to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=250.4s)]
*  suppress recognition by the immune system and other tumor survival strategies, creating an [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=259.24s)]
*  often very heterogeneous tumor cell collective that is quite hard to target with existing treatment [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=265.48s)]
*  options. These evasion strategies include the tumor microenvironment, where tumors can create [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=272.64s)]
*  an immune-suppressive environment that prevents the body's immune system from attacking cancer cells, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  in example, by inhibiting the activity of immune cells and their ability to infiltrate the tumor [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=287.44s)]
*  side. It also includes further immune evasion and resistance mechanisms, where in examples, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=295.56s)]
*  tumor can express molecules that mask them from immune cells and even create conditions [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=302.6s)]
*  that suppress an immune response from start. This can make immunotherapy, which relies on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=309.96s)]
*  boosting the immune system of the patient, much less effective. Over time, cancer cells can also [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  evolve and become resistant to the drugs designed to kill them, in example, by genetic mutations, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  the ability to repair DNA damage, or regulating the efflux of drugs out of the tumor cell. In [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=329.88s)]
*  addition, side effects and toxicity of existing treatments can also, unfortunately, help solid [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=337.68s)]
*  tumors to survive. An example of target toxicity, so toxicity caused on non-tumor tissue, and any [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=343.92s)]
*  treatment-induced side effects can significantly affect healthy tissues, often limiting the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=352.72s)]
*  treatment duration as well as the overall outcome and treatment success. In this context, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=359.6s)]
*  I'd also like to mention carhexia, a cancer and treatment-induced condition affecting a [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=365.76000000000005s)]
*  significant number of advanced stage cancer patients. It is characterized by severe weight [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=371.92s)]
*  loss and muscle wasting, which leads to reduced quality of life and often limits the patient's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=378.32s)]
*  ability to tolerate cancer therapies significantly. In summary, we simply have to see that solid tumor [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  cells have developed a lot of mechanisms to evade cancer therapy and learned how to survive attacks [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=393.68s)]
*  by therapeutics and the immune system, particularly in advanced and metastatic stage. To effectively [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=401.84s)]
*  fight these metastatic solid tumors, we definitely need new treatment strategies that can overcome [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=409.52s)]
*  or bypass these resistance mechanisms. You mentioned new strategies. I wonder, could you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  tell me maybe what the current treatments are that are being used for solid tumors? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Currently, the classic pillars of tumor treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  therapy. In addition, we've seen a wave of novel targeted therapies emerge that have further [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=436.24s)]
*  expanded our options. Here, we can mention antibodies, kinase inhibitors, and other small [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  molecules. In example, kinase inhibitors can block specific molecules and pathways [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=449.12s)]
*  involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells. Just one example here are K-RAS inhibitors, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=456.16s)]
*  and other targeted therapies here can deliver, in example, cytotoxic substances directly to the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=463.44s)]
*  cancer cell, talking here about antibody drug conjugates, so-called ADCs. Another option [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  that already exists but actually can certainly be improved further are immunotherapies that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=477.2s)]
*  stimulate and enhance existing mechanisms of the body's immune system to identify and fight cancer [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=484.8s)]
*  cells. Here, we talk about checkpoint inhibitors, which are on the market. In example, nivolumab [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=492.64s)]
*  or pembrolizumab, but also emerging cell-based therapies like CAR-T cells, which have shown [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  lots of success in hematologic diseases, but also now enter the solid tumor field. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=507.2s)]
*  There are also TCR receptor-based T cell therapies, as well as bi-specific antibodies [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=514.4s)]
*  and cancer vaccines. Our own program, Vesucromab, operates, by the way, in this field of immunotherapies. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=521.36s)]
*  It neutralizes cancer cell or treatment-induced GDF15, which is secreted by a large group of solid [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  tumors. By neutralizing GDF15, we block its immunosuppressive and carhexia-inducing function. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=536.16s)]
*  Could you tell us a bit more about immunotherapy resistance and how that is being addressed? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=544.16s)]
*  The development of resistance to immunotherapies is a major hurdle in current cancer care. We can [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=550.48s)]
*  assume that at present only 20 to 40 percent of all patients who qualify for immunotherapy treatment [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=557.28s)]
*  also show a distinct response to it. And many patients treated with immunotherapies may experience [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=565.52s)]
*  a quite limited response duration and develop resistance over time. Resistance can result from [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=572.24s)]
*  manufacturers including mutations or epigenetic regulation. In example, upregulated expression [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=580.88s)]
*  of GDF15 by tumor cells can block the influx of immune cells into the tumor site [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=588.24s)]
*  and also inhibit their activation and activity. Options to counteract immunotherapy resistance [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=594.4s)]
*  include, in example, combining immunotherapy with other treatments, in example, checkpoint inhibitors [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=601.84s)]
*  and chemotherapy to tackle the tumor through multiple mechanisms. Modulating the environment [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  is another option, in example, by inhibiting or depleting immunosuppressive immune cells, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=615.52s)]
*  talking about T-Rex here, or inhibiting angiogenesis. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  Targeting resistance from multiple angles is in the end also what we want to achieve with our [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=626.88s)]
*  GDF15 neutralizing approach, Visucromab. Visucromab blocks the impact of GDF15 in various areas of the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=632.56s)]
*  malman cycle and basically reduces the impact of these immunosuppressive mechanisms. Could you [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=640.08s)]
*  maybe tell us a little bit more about Visucromab and how it works? Yes, Visucromab is a monoclonal [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=647.76s)]
*  antibody that neutralizes the tumor-derived growth and differentiation factor 15, GDF15, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=655.92s)]
*  which is a locally acting immunosuppressant fostering immunotherapy resistance. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=663.92s)]
*  Neutralizing GDF15 with Visucromab reverses key cancer resistance mechanisms to reinstate an [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  efficient antitumor response by re-enabling immune cell activation, immune cell proliferation, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=677.36s)]
*  and this is then reflected by the induction of an interferon gamma signature in the tumor [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=685.2s)]
*  microenvironment. In addition to its anti-resistance effect, Visucromab has also the potential to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=690.08s)]
*  counteract GDF15-mediated carrexia and which can definitely severely impact a patient's quality [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=698.56s)]
*  of life and ability to tolerate treatment. Visucromab has demonstrated so far a very good [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=705.1199999999999s)]
*  safety profile in patients and quite durable and significant endotumor efficacy in these advanced [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=713.28s)]
*  stage last line anti-PD-1 relapse refractory patients. We were quite impressed specifically [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=720.88s)]
*  with the significant number of complete and complete metabolic responses we observed so far, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=725.84s)]
*  which is usually not seen in last line cancer patients undergoing an experimental treatment. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=732.32s)]
*  Leading from that, maybe you could tell us a bit more about your clinical development program [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=739.2s)]
*  and what stage you're at with that? Yes, absolutely. Visucromab is currently [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=745.36s)]
*  evaluated in an ongoing phase 2a program. Here we actually treat several solid tumor indications [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=751.04s)]
*  and this program includes the Godfather 1 trial, which we published recently in Nature, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=759.2s)]
*  but also a neoadjuvant exploration in so far untreated patients with muscle-invasive [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=766.0s)]
*  bladder cancer, the Godfather Neo-UC trial. Based on these promising interim data from both trials, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=773.12s)]
*  we're currently preparing for the initiation of a broad phase 2b development program [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=782.96s)]
*  for Visucromab in earlier treatment settings. Here specifically moving into first and second [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=788.24s)]
*  line treatment and non-small cell lung cancer is here one lead indication for us, but we also [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=793.52s)]
*  launch trials in other tumor types within 2025. And what would represent success for patients [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=800.72s)]
*  that are being treated with Visucromab? Our mission here is to provide a clear benefit for [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=811.76s)]
*  patients by significantly improving treatment outcomes on top of a variety of existing standard [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=816.88s)]
*  of care treatments. And here specifically enter PD-1, PD-Ling-1 therapies where we have seen [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=824.0s)]
*  significant activity in combination with Visucromab and the other treatments that we have [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=830.8s)]
*  already done. We also expect that we can improve the quality of life and the ability to tolerate [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=838.16s)]
*  treatment for cancer patients by GDF-15 blockade, specifically here by impacting Cachexia. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  The benefits so far we've seen has been highlighted by the induction of quite deep and specifically [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=859.52s)]
*  long-term responses up to complete responses in last line patients that were relapse refractory [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=867.28s)]
*  to standard treatment including anti-PD-1 and PD-Ling-1 treatments. And our latest clinical data [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=875.52s)]
*  now seem to indicate that we not only can achieve this part, but also should be able here to alleviate [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=882.56s)]
*  the symptoms of cancer Cachexia. In summary, our goal here is to further investigate this dual benefit [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=892.56s)]
*  now in patients of earlier disease stages, moving the program into first and second line disease [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=900.16s)]
*  setting and exploring this in several major cancer types. And how do you see the future [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=906.88s)]
*  ultimately for people with solid tumors? Are there many new treatment options that you see [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=915.28s)]
*  coming through in the next few years perhaps? Yes, indeed. I think there is significant progress [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=921.76s)]
*  in many areas. And naturally, the overall goal within the biotech and pharmaceutical industry [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  is to make solid tumors in the end, hopefully, a manageable chronic disease with a reasonably [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=934.08s)]
*  good quality of life for the patients. In the best case, of course, we hopefully can even move to a [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  place where we can provide a cure even in metastatic settings, but that still has to be achieved. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=948.72s)]
*  In this context, refining targeted treatments will remain a major focus of the industry, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=957.44s)]
*  specifically fighting immune resistance mechanisms that so far have limited the treatment success [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=964.48s)]
*  and response duration of immunotherapies. Including Visucromab, we see quite a few exciting new [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=970.88s)]
*  approaches currently being developed that we feel could provide meaningful improvements for patients. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=977.28s)]
*  The focus will be on bringing multiple pathways together here and will continue, in example, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=984.24s)]
*  with the potentially big impact currently anti-PD-Ling1 VEGF by specifics seem to have. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=991.68s)]
*  We have seen here quite interesting data at the recent ESMO conference. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1000.24s)]
*  And this approach, an example of these by specifics targeting PP1 and VEGF duly also addresses the tumor [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1005.2s)]
*  microenvironment by counteracting and eugenesis and the immunosuppressive mechanism of VEGF. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1014.32s)]
*  And I think this overall highlights, again, the momentum we see happening again in the IO space, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1021.6s)]
*  where for some years people probably thought after a number of failures that not too much [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1030.56s)]
*  progress is happening. But I think this has changed. We see now significant advances in several areas. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1035.9199999999998s)]
*  And in addition, I would say we are also seeing a quite significant interest now in tackling [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1044.0s)]
*  carrexia, which is gaining attention as a major treatment limiting factor, as seen by recent data [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1049.6799999999998s)]
*  from Pfizer's Ponsecromab program, which actually was published at ESMO last year [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1056.56s)]
*  and in the New England Journal of Medicine, as well as our own clinical data here for Vesucromab [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1063.12s)]
*  that were published in Nature. Is there anything else that you have at the company in the pipeline? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1069.12s)]
*  And I guess, where do you go from here with your existing projects? Yeah, great question. And, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, we can say that in Vesucromab is in fact a pipeline in a product because our approach [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1083.12s)]
*  is quite versatile on one side in regard to the combination options, providing the potential to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1090.56s)]
*  complement many approved and upcoming cancer therapeutics, including, by the way, PD-1, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1097.6s)]
*  VEGF bi-specifix, ADCs, but also existing standard of care like chemotherapeutics and antibodies. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1103.4399999999998s)]
*  And this includes the potential to complement, an example, of course, the large checkpoint inhibitor [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1111.12s)]
*  market where we see significant activity in combination, as Vesucromab could enhance [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1117.28s)]
*  checkpoint inhibitor activity substantially here, but also enhancement of other oncology therapies, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1123.36s)]
*  such as chemotherapy and ADCs seems possible. Furthermore, there are significant opportunities [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  in the area of carexia care, a condition that has a major negative impact on cancer patients. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1136.08s)]
*  And taken together, our goal is here to provide a true clinical benefit for a broad and quite [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  diverse cancer patient population, comprising of a variety of tumour types and disease stages, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1151.52s)]
*  but also non-oncology indications of interest. Is there anything else that you would like to add? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1159.76s)]
*  You know, this is really an exciting time, I think. Immunotherapy is moving forward boldly. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1165.2s)]
*  We see a quite broad wave of novel therapeutics coming, and we're really grateful to be able to [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1170.8s)]
*  be part of this whole movement and to bring better therapies to patients. This is such a joy, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1178.56s)]
*  and hopefully we can succeed here together with others in the field. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1185.2s)]
*  It's always good to hear about positive steps being taken to take on cancer, especially those [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1189.04s)]
*  cancers that are particularly difficult to treat. Just a reminder that this week's podcast was [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K3gpJXTi6I&t=1201.52s)]
