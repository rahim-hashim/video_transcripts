Video Description: Telomeres are structures made from DNA sequences and proteins, and they are found at the ends of chromosomes. 

In effect, they cap and protect the end of a chromosome. Telomerase is an enzyme that adds DNA to the ends of chromosomes, and it is reactivated in most cancers. Most human tumors not only express telomerase but also have very short telomeres. This makes telomerase a prime target for cancer therapies. 


MAIA Biotechnology is focused on the pioneering approach of telomere targeting through its lead therapeutic strategy, THIO. 


Currently, MAIA is making strides with THIO in a phase 2 clinical trial aimed at combating high-risk non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). THIO targets telomerase, thus disrupting cancer cells’ vital structures, leading to their rapid demise. 


To tell us about MAIA’s groundbreaking work, and the relationships between telomeres, telomerase and cancer, is the CEO and chairman of the company, Vlad Vitoc.

# Targeting telomerase to disrupt cancer
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 113. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly podcast from LeBioTek. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=16.16s)]
*  And this week the subject is telomeres and telomerase and their role in cancer. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Telomerase are structures made of DNA sequences and proteins and they're found at the end [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=28.3s)]
*  of chromosomes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  In effect they cap and protect the end of a chromosome. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=34.42s)]
*  Telomerase is an enzyme that adds DNA to the end of chromosomes and it is reactivated in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=39.54s)]
*  many cancers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=45.86s)]
*  Most human tumors not only express telomerase but also have very short telomeres. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=48.14s)]
*  So telomerase is a target for cancer therapies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=54.1s)]
*  Maya Biotechnology is a company focused on the pioneering approach of telomere targeting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=58.260000000000005s)]
*  And to tell us about the relationship between telomeres, telomerase and cancer is the CEO [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=65.26s)]
*  and chairman of Maya, Vlad Vitov. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=70.94s)]
*  Alright so I guess to start I wonder if you could tell me about the origins of Maya Biotechnology. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=76.5s)]
*  Yes of course. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=83.46s)]
*  So Maya Biotechnology is a company that I founded six years ago in 2018 as a Delaware company [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=86.58s)]
*  headquartered in Chicago to develop novel treatments for cancer and started the company [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=95.74s)]
*  with the licensing of Thio from University of Texas which is the first telomere targeting [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=102.78s)]
*  agent in the world with very significant immunogenicity meaning it has the capability [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=110.62s)]
*  of training the immune system to respond to cancer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=116.98s)]
*  So the company formed in 2018 and we went public in 2022. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  We listed on New York Stock Exchange and the ticker is Maya. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=128.06s)]
*  What's the role of telomerase in cancer? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=134.26s)]
*  The role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer was only recently characterized and it is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=137.62s)]
*  a fundamental role. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=142.46s)]
*  So imagine the chromosome usually represented as an X that contains our DNA, our genetic [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=144.96s)]
*  information and at the end of the chromosome arms are the telomeres, our target. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=151.86s)]
*  The telomeres are also DNA sequences like the chromosome but they are much shorter and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=160.34s)]
*  they have a very clear function to protect the integrity of the chromosome in the cell [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  division cycle so that the information, the chromosomal information DNA transfers to the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=174.24s)]
*  daughter cell unscathed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=180.26s)]
*  The telomeres are built and maintained by the enzyme telomerase which is present in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=183.16s)]
*  all normal cells in the first year of life. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=189.14s)]
*  At age one approximately telomerase goes away and at that point the telomeres have reached [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=192.98s)]
*  their maximum length and from then on with each cell division cycle they lose a little [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=200.05999999999997s)]
*  until in the old age they become critically short, they can no longer protect the chromosome [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=207.22s)]
*  and mutations begin to appear and with this the diseases of the old age including cancer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=214.86s)]
*  But in cancer cells something extraordinary happens. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=223.94s)]
*  The enzyme telomerase is reactivated so the cancer cells regain their ability to elongate [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  their telomeres and so they reach a state of replicative immortality. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=236.74s)]
*  They continue to divide and the cancer grows in the otherwise aging body and so this is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=242.7s)]
*  where thio comes in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  Thio, which is short for 6-thio 2' deoxyguanosine is a guanine analog and is picked up by telomerase. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=250.26s)]
*  It's placed in the structure of the telomere. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=260.02s)]
*  This creates a faulty structure, unstable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=263.28s)]
*  The telomere collapses, the DNA unwinds and the cancer cell dies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=266.38s)]
*  This process is fast and efficient. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=272.82s)]
*  It happens in 24 to 72 hours and thio directly kills 70 to 90% of the cancer cells. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=276.82s)]
*  Then follows its immunogenic effect. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=286.74s)]
*  Of the telomeric fragments, micronuclei are formed that present these fragments to the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=289.9s)]
*  immune cells, triggering an immune response so efficient that if you follow thio with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=297.78s)]
*  an immune therapy such as a checkpoint inhibitor, you see complete response, no recurrence and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=305.9s)]
*  anti-tumor immune memory. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=314.7s)]
*  Cure. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=318.14s)]
*  We have seen this in preclinical setting in many tumor types. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=319.62s)]
*  We have seen it in lung cancer, in liver cancer, in brain cancer, colorectal, small cell lung [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=323.74s)]
*  cancer with thio in sequential combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=331.29999999999995s)]
*  lipthio of Regeneron, ketruda of Merck, and tecentric of Genentech. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=337.06s)]
*  The first go to market is with Regeneron's lipthio for non-small cell lung cancer. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=343.18s)]
*  The data in the preclinical setting was so compelling that the FDA awarded thio three [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=350.54s)]
*  orphan drug designations out of the first three applications. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=358.74s)]
*  Huge endorsement for the quality of the data. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=363.22s)]
*  We have it in a small cell lung cancer, in hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a dominant [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=366.02s)]
*  histology in primary liver cancers, about 90%, and in brain cancers, including glioblastoma. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=372.82s)]
*  So that's the science behind it all. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=381.46s)]
*  You were mentioning about how it's associated with old age. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=384.82s)]
*  Are there other things that affect the length of telomeres, like lifestyle choices, I guess? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=395.94s)]
*  The researchers are looking into this to see what can be done to keep the telomeres long [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=396.94s)]
*  in the healthy cells. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=402.42s)]
*  We are addressing the cancerous cells. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  So we're using this new knowledge of the biology of telomeres and telomerase in cancers [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=407.34s)]
*  to kill the cancer cells. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=414.14s)]
*  So our drug thio destroys the telomeres immediately, but only in cancer cells. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=415.72s)]
*  And how does it actually work? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=422.62s)]
*  Well, thio is incorporated in the telomeric structure instead of a guanine base. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=425.3s)]
*  It is an analog of guanine. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=431.54s)]
*  And this happens with an affinity of 14,000 times versus the integration in the chromosomal [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=433.62s)]
*  DNA. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=440.06s)]
*  So essentially, it gets integrated just in the telomeric DNA. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=441.06s)]
*  Now what makes thio specific to cancer cells versus normal cells? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=445.86s)]
*  It's not, actually. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  It will kill any cell that is telomerase positive. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=451.86s)]
*  But cancer cells, in aggregate, 85% are telomerase positive. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=455.66s)]
*  Some tumor types are 100% telomerase positive, such as small cell lung cancer. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  Non-small cell lung cancer is 85, colorectal 90, HCC 90. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=466.7s)]
*  On the low end of the spectrum, you have neuroblastoma and sarcoma with about 40%. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  So high percentages. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=478.74s)]
*  Now in contrast, normal cells under 1% are telomerase positive. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=480.26s)]
*  And they are telomerase positive only two or three days in a month, as opposed to cancer [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=486.78s)]
*  cells who are telomerase positive 24-7. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=493.34s)]
*  So if thio were to be administered every day, it will kill some normal cells as well. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=497.46s)]
*  But the collateral damage, as you can imagine, is minuscule. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=503.5s)]
*  We are only administering thio three days in a 21-day cycle. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=506.46s)]
*  So the collateral damage is minuscule. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  And this is seen in the safety profile of the drug in the clinic, which appears to be [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=512.98s)]
*  as safe as anticipated. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=518.9s)]
*  Very safe. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=521.9s)]
*  So there are no real dangers associated with it other than you mentioned that very minor [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=523.1s)]
*  collateral damage, I guess? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=528.66s)]
*  That's right, yes. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=530.98s)]
*  We're using thio going forward at a dose of 180 milligrams per cycle of therapy, 180. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=531.98s)]
*  And the maximum tolerated dose is 2,500 milligrams, 14 times under the maximum tolerated dose. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=540.5s)]
*  And how is it delivered? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=548.62s)]
*  And what does it do once it gets into the body? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=549.62s)]
*  It's delivered IV. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  So the schedule of administration was optimized in preclinical setting and then in the clinic. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=554.74s)]
*  We give thio three consecutive days, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=560.66s)]
*  It's an IV administration. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=565.62s)]
*  It's very easy to take. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  No reactions, much like a checkpoint inhibitor therapy outpatient. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=569.06s)]
*  And then on Thursday is a day of break for the immunogenic effect to take place. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=574.4599999999999s)]
*  And on Friday, we come in with the checkpoint inhibitor, lipthio for lung cancer, which [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=580.1s)]
*  we dose as approved. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=585.6999999999999s)]
*  We don't change anything about lipthio. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=587.38s)]
*  We just bring thio prior to lipthio to make it into a regimen that works. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=589.98s)]
*  And cycles are every 21 days. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=596.26s)]
*  And does that eventually cure or do people have to have that for life, I guess? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=599.7s)]
*  Cure is possible. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=606.14s)]
*  Now, where we go in first with the market entry strategy, as is necessary with approval [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=607.14s)]
*  processes in the US, Europe and other countries, you have to go first to very sick patients [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=612.22s)]
*  that have no other option. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=617.9s)]
*  We're talking advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in third line of therapy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=619.82s)]
*  This setting is not a curable setting. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=625.5s)]
*  And here the goal is to prolong survival, which thio does very well. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=628.1800000000001s)]
*  What we plan to do in the future is to go to first line of therapy, where we hope for [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=634.12s)]
*  cure and also to perioperative administration, peri-surgical administration, meaning neoadjuvant [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=639.58s)]
*  after surgery, where cure is definitely the goal. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  These are coming in the near future. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=652.62s)]
*  Very good news. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=654.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=655.98s)]
*  Is this a field that there are a lot of companies active in? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=656.98s)]
*  No, we are the first, first company making telomere targeting agents. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=660.06s)]
*  Is that the only thing in your pipeline or are there other things that you're working [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=664.66s)]
*  on as well? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=668.06s)]
*  There are other things. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=669.06s)]
*  We have started about two years ago a program of the next generation of telomere targeting [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=670.46s)]
*  agents. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=676.78s)]
*  And in this program, we invented 84 new molecules. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=677.94s)]
*  Some fall into different classes, four different classes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  Some of them are structural evolution of thio. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=686.28s)]
*  Others are new structures. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=690.54s)]
*  We tested them all in preclinical setting in cell cultures and then in animal models. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=693.54s)]
*  Seven of them proved to be an order of magnitude superior to the original in certain tumor [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  types. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=708.66s)]
*  Of the seven, two have started preclinical development towards IND, investigation on [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=709.66s)]
*  the drug designation. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=716.62s)]
*  And they are more than halfway through now. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=718.62s)]
*  And we expect to put them in the clinic next year. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=720.78s)]
*  A third one is ready to start also. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=724.3000000000001s)]
*  And we have four more molecules in reserve. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=727.58s)]
*  So we're building a franchise of telomere targeting agents. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=730.74s)]
*  And could you tell me a bit about your clinical trials and the pathway there? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=734.5400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=739.02s)]
*  So we have completed a phase two trial, those selection trial called Thio 101 in non-small [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=740.02s)]
*  cell lung cancer in advanced patients that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=746.94s)]
*  And second and third line of therapy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=752.34s)]
*  This group of patients is by far the largest segment in non-small cell lung cancer patients [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=754.38s)]
*  today that doesn't have anything approved and nothing is under development right now. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=760.26s)]
*  We are leading the way here. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=766.58s)]
*  This trial, we started with a Part A safety lead-in and then continued with randomizing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=768.62s)]
*  between three doses, 60 milligrams per cycle, which was the curative dose in preclinical [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=775.1800000000001s)]
*  setting translated to humans, 180 and 360, all of them far under the maximum tolerated [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=780.64s)]
*  dose of 2500. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  Now these are very sick patients. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=790.84s)]
*  Remember, these are advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=792.32s)]
*  So first of all, a few words about non-small cell lung cancer patients. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=796.0400000000001s)]
*  Non-small cell is the largest tumor type in the world by mortality. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=800.2s)]
*  Two million patients die every year of it globally and by dollar sales, $34 billion [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=805.0s)]
*  per year. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=812.28s)]
*  So non-small cell is an insidious disease. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=813.84s)]
*  It evolves without signs and symptoms. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=816.84s)]
*  And by the time the patients present, the disease is advanced. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=820.48s)]
*  In 60% of the patients present with very advanced disease. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=824.08s)]
*  Incurable, not amenable to surgery, which is the only curative intent right now. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=828.68s)]
*  Curative intent therapy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=834.84s)]
*  And the goal for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients is to prolong life. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=836.4s)]
*  And progress has been made when back to 20, 30 years ago when I was in medical school, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  survival in these patients was on the average from new diagnosis, from the newly diagnosed [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=847.96s)]
*  moment to death under 12 months. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=853.0s)]
*  Now it's pushing on three years. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=857.36s)]
*  So progress has been made, but no one is cured in this setting. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=860.12s)]
*  So what happens to these patients is they are first tested before therapy begins. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=864.56s)]
*  They are tested for targetable mutations to see if targeted therapy can be used successfully. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=869.5999999999999s)]
*  About 30, 40% of the patients have a targetable mutation and will receive that type of therapy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=876.4s)]
*  But 60, 70% of the patients do not. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  And they have to receive immune therapy or a combination of immune therapy plus chemotherapy. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=887.1199999999999s)]
*  The results are not great. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=894.44s)]
*  This is first line of therapy, the first therapy they receive. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=896.24s)]
*  But the results are complete response rates are 2 to 5% complete response. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  Cure is defined as complete response sustained for five years or longer. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=906.9200000000001s)]
*  That doesn't really exist. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=912.24s)]
*  2 to 5% complete response, 30, 40% partial response, 30, 40% stable disease as the best [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=913.84s)]
*  response and 20% just don't respond. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=923.4000000000001s)]
*  They just go right through. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  They have a hyper aggressive disease and they die very quickly. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=928.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, the patients that have some type of response on the average progress after seven, eight, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=932.2s)]
*  nine months. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=938.2s)]
*  When they progress, they move on to what is called second line of therapy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=939.32s)]
*  In second line of therapy, they receive the chemotherapy or a combination of chemo and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=944.2s)]
*  some VGFR receptor agent. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=950.68s)]
*  But the responses are 20% at best stable disease, another 20, 30%. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=952.92s)]
*  Most of them don't respond at all after three to four months, five months, they progress. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=959.0s)]
*  And then they move to third line of therapy. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=964.52s)]
*  In third line, nothing really works. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=966.92s)]
*  So what we see here with Tyome, we see that in third line of therapy, first of all, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=969.4s)]
*  between the three doses, the three doses, all of them worked very, very well, way much better. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=974.68s)]
*  Then chemotherapy, we saw initially the first metric of response was disease control rates. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=980.8399999999999s)]
*  Disease control rates were 80, 90 up to 100% compared to 30, 40% with chemotherapy in the [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=987.0799999999999s)]
*  setting. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=995.0799999999999s)]
*  So more than double safety was very well tolerated in all doses. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=995.7199999999999s)]
*  But what stood out was response rates, which at the 180 milligram dose, we saw the greatest [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1001.7199999999999s)]
*  response rates. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1008.5999999999999s)]
*  This data became apparent in November of last year. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1009.96s)]
*  180 was selected for us the best dose by the trial independent committee. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1013.08s)]
*  And then enrollment was completed by February. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1019.72s)]
*  Then we went to the FDA to review the data with them and get their feedback. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1023.08s)]
*  We cooperated the feedback and now we are standing up to pivotal trials for approval [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1027.32s)]
*  in the United States and globally. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1033.8s)]
*  And that's where we are today. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1036.2s)]
*  Does the timing make a difference? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1037.96s)]
*  I mean, is this something that you could potentially see being used as a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1039.72s)]
*  preventative treatment? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1044.68s)]
*  As a preventative treatment, in a sense, yes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  Prevention of recurrence, in that sense, yes. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1049.24s)]
*  But remember, Tyome needs telomerase to be present to work. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1052.76s)]
*  If there is no telomerase, Tyome is inert. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1056.3600000000001s)]
*  Prevention by definition means prevention of cancer. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1059.0800000000002s)]
*  If there is no telomerase, there is no way for Tyome to act in that sense. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1063.48s)]
*  But prevention of recurrence, on the other hand, that is something that Tyome can make [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1067.4s)]
*  a big difference. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1073.64s)]
*  And we have seen that in many of our patients. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1075.24s)]
*  They have been treated with a few cycles of Tyome. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1079.64s)]
*  And for one reason or another, the treatment was concluded. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1083.3200000000002s)]
*  And then a year or longer later, without therapy, there was no recurrence of the disease. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  So no progression of the disease. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1094.6000000000001s)]
*  So that's the type of prevention that we will see. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1096.68s)]
*  I know you mentioned you're the only company working in this area currently. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1099.5600000000002s)]
*  Are there many studies being done on the role of telomeres and telomerase? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1104.68s)]
*  Yes, we are planning other studies as well. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1110.52s)]
*  We are pursuing the data that was generated so far. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1112.92s)]
*  And we are planning to start trials in colorectal cancer, in hepatocelular carcinoma, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1117.5600000000002s)]
*  and in small cell lung cancer as company-sponsored trials. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1125.0s)]
*  We're looking to partner with a number of different big pharmaceutical companies, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1129.16s)]
*  manufacturers of checkpoint inhibitors. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1133.64s)]
*  These conversations are well underway. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1135.96s)]
*  We are also pursuing other tumor types as investigator-sponsored trials. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1138.04s)]
*  Investigator-sponsored trials is another way to do these trials at a lower cost as a proof of [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1143.48s)]
*  concept. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1148.36s)]
*  And we have this type of investigator-sponsored trials about to be open in multiple tumor types [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  in such as gastric cancer or different types of brain cancer, different types of colorectal cancer. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1156.04s)]
*  We're in advanced discussions with several institutions in that direction. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1163.08s)]
*  So a tile in concept will work in any cell that is telomerase positive. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1166.1999999999998s)]
*  And cancer cells, large percentages of them by tumor type are telomerase positive. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1172.0400000000002s)]
*  So we aim to pursue as many as possible and to hopefully find curative solutions for as [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1178.6000000000001s)]
*  many patients as possible. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1184.68s)]
*  Are there any cancers that aren't telomerase positive? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1186.5200000000002s)]
*  Yes, there are. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1191.0s)]
*  For instance, in sarcomas, 60% of sarcomas are not telomerase positive and tile will not work there. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1192.0400000000002s)]
*  Is there a reason for that difference? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1199.64s)]
*  We don't know at this point in time. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1202.68s)]
*  It's early days in the science of telomerase in cancer. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  We don't know why some cancers are telomerase positive and others are not. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1208.52s)]
*  The research is ongoing right now about all that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1213.48s)]
*  But we at least know how to diagnose telomerase positivity. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1217.72s)]
*  That's a huge progress. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1222.44s)]
*  Keep in mind, most biomarkers for efficacy, especially when it comes to targeted therapies, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1224.1200000000001s)]
*  the percentages that qualify certain patients with a mutation are very low. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1231.64s)]
*  For instance, EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer is present in about 10-15% of the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1237.32s)]
*  patients only. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1244.28s)]
*  And that's the largest contingent of mutations. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1245.8s)]
*  Then others are less than that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1249.96s)]
*  They're in the order of 1-5% such as ALK or KRAS or others. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1252.76s)]
*  What we're looking for here is 85% of non-small cell lung cancer are telomerase positive. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1259.0s)]
*  Huge. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1265.4s)]
*  What do you think the future holds for telomere targeting therapies? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1266.1200000000001s)]
*  I think this is the most exciting concept today by far. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1270.76s)]
*  I'm not aware of any other target with biological relevance in the treatment of cancer [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  that has such a high prevalence and the KRAS just about every tumor type. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1281.64s)]
*  This is an advancement of the science today that we aim to capitalize on and deliver [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1287.24s)]
*  excellent treatments, the best quality treatments possible for patients with this blood. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1295.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1300.92s)]
*  And are there any challenges to that? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1301.5600000000002s)]
*  I know that you're the first company doing this. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1303.8000000000002s)]
*  Does that present any challenges being the only one? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1306.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, challenges and opportunities alike, especially in the beginning when the mechanism of action [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1309.8799999999999s)]
*  was first characterized as anything new. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1316.1999999999998s)]
*  The first reaction of people seeing it is disbelief. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  Now we have many believers. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1323.08s)]
*  So when I was in the beginning, even I, when I looked at this at first time, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1326.28s)]
*  thought this is too good to be true. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1331.32s)]
*  Six years ago, when I first saw the science behind all this. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1333.48s)]
*  And now we see it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1337.24s)]
*  We see it playing out not just in animal models, but in patients that are very sick. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1338.76s)]
*  We more than double efficacy results. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1344.52s)]
*  Disease control rates moved in third line of therapy. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1347.56s)]
*  For instance, disease control rates with normal chemo, 30%. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1350.76s)]
*  We have 88%, 88 more than double survival with chemo 5.8 months with this. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1354.68s)]
*  Now well beyond 10 and tracking to be if we haven't reached the median yet for overall survival, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1362.28s)]
*  it's tracking to be somewhere in the 12 to 14 month interval, possibly even better. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1368.44s)]
*  And this is for third line of therapy patients who have absolutely nothing for them. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1374.3600000000001s)]
*  This is a game changer. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1378.44s)]
*  And then from here, we want to go to first line of therapy where we can improve on complete response [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1380.1200000000001s)]
*  rates. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1386.6000000000001s)]
*  And then we go to perioperative setting where we improve on curative rates. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1387.56s)]
*  That's our objective. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1392.3600000000001s)]
*  Is word spreading? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1394.76s)]
*  I mean, it sounds you mentioned about sounding too good to be true. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1395.96s)]
*  And it clearly seems like it's something that's huge in cancer treatment. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1399.4s)]
*  Is it is word spreading in the physician community and in the biopharma community as well about [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1404.52s)]
*  your work? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1411.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1412.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1413.72s)]
*  And we are constantly taking out the word. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1414.28s)]
*  Just recently, I was at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting in Spain and met [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1417.96s)]
*  with 15 key opinion leaders around the globe from American, but also from other countries [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1424.12s)]
*  like Japan or Korea and Europe. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1430.9199999999998s)]
*  So the enthusiasm when they see this data is extraordinary. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1435.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to work with the drug. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1440.36s)]
*  They want to participate in our company sponsored trials. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1443.08s)]
*  They want to start investigator sponsored trials. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  All of them. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1448.9199999999998s)]
*  For pharmaceutical companies, our first partner, of course, is Regeneron. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1449.96s)]
*  This partnership is in the format of a clinical supply agreement. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1455.3200000000002s)]
*  They supply their drug liptio for our Thio 101 trial in non-small cell on cancer. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1459.48s)]
*  But we want to go beyond liptio now because this drug works so well with so many different [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1464.92s)]
*  checkpoint inhibitors. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1471.24s)]
*  And we've seen that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1472.76s)]
*  And now we want to use that in the clinic as well. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1473.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1477.16s)]
*  Is there anything that you'd like to add that we didn't cover? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1477.56s)]
*  Just one more thing to point out. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1481.96s)]
*  When we started this company, we had the limited investor base. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1483.72s)]
*  They are now with us for six years. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1487.96s)]
*  And we have a huge group of followers and believers now. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1491.8799999999999s)]
*  We now have more than 4,000 investors already. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1497.0s)]
*  So that's a large number of investors for a company at this stage in the game. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  We see it that because of the market, the nature of the markets being so fragile in [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1506.2800000000002s)]
*  the last two years, the company is hugely undervalued today compared to what it should be. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1512.2s)]
*  So that means the opportunity for an investor to come in and participate in making a difference [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1519.8000000000002s)]
*  here in survival for patients and down the line, we hope, in cure for patients is huge. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1525.8000000000002s)]
*  And at the same time, making a phenomenal return on investment. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1534.76s)]
*  I think this is a great time to come in. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1538.84s)]
*  Well, listening to Vlad and some of the data he's quoting about tackling cancer [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1545.56s)]
*  by taking on telomerase is definitely inspiring. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1550.84s)]
*  And it offers a great deal of hope, certainly a treatment and a company to follow closely. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1555.24s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1561.5600000000002s)]
*  and I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrupuTIoBg&t=1567.48s)]
