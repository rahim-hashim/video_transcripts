Video Description: Biotechnology has always been a dynamic domain, but the world of finance that provides the fuel for the fire is just as vibrant. Trying to predict where the market for biotech investment is heading is always risky but for experts like Baker McKenzie's Roel Meers, understanding where the market is moving is where he eats.
I spoke to Roel this week to unpack just where biotech funding stands in Q2 2025, to get a feel for the sorts of M&As, IPOs, and licensing deals we should be looking for in the second half of the year. We also talk about some alternative financing options for innovators and early-stage firms.

# The state of biotech finance and fundraising in Q2 2025 with Baker McKenzie
**Beyond Biotech:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Cassane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 149 for the podcast. Biotechnology has always been a dynamic domain, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=11.4s)]
*  but the world of finance that provides the fuel for the fire is just as vibrant. Trying [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=18.92s)]
*  to predict where the market for biotech investments is heading is always risky, but for an expert [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  like Baker Mackenzie's Roel Mears, understanding where the market is moving is where he eats. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=29.08s)]
*  I spoke to Roel this week to unpack just where biotech funding stands in quarter two 2025 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=35.76s)]
*  and to get a feel for the sorts of M&A's, IPO's and licensing deals that we should [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=41.68s)]
*  be looking for in the second half of the year. We also talk about some alternative financing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=46.06s)]
*  options for innovators and early stage firms. There's a lot to cover and so, without further [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=50.84s)]
*  delay, please enjoy my conversation with Roel Mears of Baker Mackenzie. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=57.04s)]
*  Roel, welcome to Beyond Biotech. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=62.72s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=67.72s)]
*  Roel, can you start by sharing a little bit about your journey to where you are now, a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=69.68s)]
*  partner there at Baker Mackenzie. What drew you to actually specialize in this particular [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=74.32s)]
*  field? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=78.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm Roel. I'm a partner sitting in Brussels for Baker Mackenzie and I've been [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=80.56s)]
*  with the firm since 1997, so that's close to 28 years. It's quite a long time, but ever [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=88.92s)]
*  since I started, I've been a member of the corporate group. In full transparency, I joined [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=99.4s)]
*  the firm with the idea to do IP law and I studied IP law, but very quickly I pivoted [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=106.76s)]
*  towards corporate finance, so corporate M&A financing because that's really much more [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=116.84s)]
*  exciting than intellectual property when you're sitting in a civil law jurisdiction. That's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  the reason why I ended up in corporate finance and I'm still doing it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=132.76s)]
*  But you're in corporate finance with quite a specialty then in life sciences next to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=138.16s)]
*  that, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, life sciences because the Belgian economic landscape is such that you have a great many [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=143.76s)]
*  of biotech companies. When I started, there was really a big wave of spin outs from universities [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=153.64s)]
*  and our firm was involved in quite a number of those deals. Actually, the very first transaction [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=163.2s)]
*  in which I was involved was for a company called DevGen. We were involved in the actual [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  first financing rounds and then since that transaction where I was only having the role [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=180.92s)]
*  of telling people where to sign their signature on a piece of paper. It was very limited, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  but then we were involved in all the other steps down to the IP law and even the take [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  private a couple of years ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=200.44s)]
*  You started doing these spin outs then. Today, is it still what you're involved in or is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=204.72s)]
*  there something else that's a little bit more exciting about the world of bioscience now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=209.48s)]
*  We started with spin outs. We did the whole life cycle and I must say we're back to the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=215.92s)]
*  start of the cycle because over the last couple of months, we had again a big number of financing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  transactions, series A transactions for a couple of Belgian biotech companies. It almost [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=232.32s)]
*  looks like we are back to where we started so many years ago. You can also see it a little [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  bit in the markets. There are no longer any real IPOs planned. Obviously, everybody still talks [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  about IPOs, but at least in the Benelux for the biotech space, biotech markets are not that, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=255.56s)]
*  I mean, they are known basically and globally it's very similar. But activity continues and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=261.16s)]
*  great ideas still come into existence. People discover stuff and people are interested in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=268.92s)]
*  investing in these things. We see that while there is no activity at the back end of the cycle, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  there is still a lot of activity at the beginning at the source. It looks like we're almost back [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=283.64s)]
*  at that point again. Are you just working in Benelux or just in Europe or are you also working [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  on more global deals? I'm sitting in Brussels focusing really on the Belgian market, the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  Benelux market, but as a firm, we're pretty much active all across the globe. My role is being a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=306.2s)]
*  co-chair of the healthcare and life sciences sector for the firm in EMEA. I'm also a member [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=315.0s)]
*  of the global group. I have responsibility also globally and for EMEA in basically coaching the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=322.28s)]
*  team, helping out the team and being somewhat of a spokesperson for the team. I must say we have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=332.76s)]
*  quite a large group within the firm. A group of people covering not only the dealers, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=341.88s)]
*  people in the corporate arena, but also a lot of regulatory experts sitting all over the globe. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=351.4s)]
*  Particularly in Europe, we have quite a big contingent of people sitting in all the major [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=357.96s)]
*  jurisdictions. From that perspective, it's great to see the combination of the corporate or the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=362.68s)]
*  dealers working together with the regulatory people to give the proper advice that our clients [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=371.72s)]
*  are looking for. I guess on that regulatory side, is there a deal that comes to mind recently from [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=378.92s)]
*  Biotech or Bio Pharma that speaks to that experience that Baker-McKenzie has? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  Not immediately because in almost every transaction, you usually have quite an important [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=392.04s)]
*  regulatory angle. If it's not a relation to clinical trials, there are some sticky questions [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=401.24s)]
*  in relation to the FDA approval process. There can be some questions in terms of reimbursement. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=408.12s)]
*  So in almost every transaction, you always have that regulatory dimension. Then it's great to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=416.52s)]
*  have some very solid colleagues sitting in our firm that can help out on these things. Particularly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=422.44s)]
*  now, as you can imagine, the FDA process is quite a point of attention for a couple of our clients. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=429.4s)]
*  Being able to navigate these issues is quite important. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=437.96s)]
*  One of the reasons we wanted to have you on the podcast was to get a big picture view of what [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=442.44s)]
*  funding is like right now in Europe for Biotech. Pretty recently, you've noted that the Biotech [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=448.28s)]
*  funding is starting to rebound a little bit. Investors are starting to look at these high [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=454.44s)]
*  quality early stage companies. Can you give me that broad look? What are investors looking for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=459.4s)]
*  beyond just having a good management team? What are investors looking for in 2025 in Biotech? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=466.2s)]
*  It's a very good question. I guess the answer that I would have given you earlier in the year [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=473.64s)]
*  is somewhat different than today. I think today we are faced with quite some [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  turmoil in the markets. The reciprocal tariffs that have been announced are creating [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=493.56s)]
*  a lot of uncertainty in the market. A lot of situations are rather dynamic, as some people say, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  kinetic. But that being said, companies are still looking to fund. A number of companies [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=508.92s)]
*  really are looking for funding. What I see is that particularly today, people are trying to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  de-risk their transactions as much as possible by looking really at science that is solid [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=529.4s)]
*  in therapeutic areas that are almost, I don't want to call them fashionable, but you see that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=540.84s)]
*  there is a lot of inflow still into oncology and also into metabolic diseases, diabetes. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=548.6s)]
*  Those are the things that we can expect potentially some higher returns. That also might [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=556.2s)]
*  de-risk your transactions. We see a lot of inflow there, but also in some other areas of unmet needs, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=564.6s)]
*  some neuro generative diseases and whatnot. There I think we still see a lot of activity, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=575.4000000000001s)]
*  but it's fair to say that the situation is somewhat uncertain nowadays. Getting rid of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=583.16s)]
*  as many uncertainties as possible is very important for companies, but also for investors. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=591.4s)]
*  In the beginning of the year, I would have told you that there is a lot of activity and that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=600.12s)]
*  many investors look again at doing transactions at a very early stage, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=606.84s)]
*  at pre-clinical trials. I mentioned already at the start, we've done quite a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=615.1600000000001s)]
*  number of series A funding transactions, but query whether some of these deals [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=619.88s)]
*  would have gone forward in the current market circumstances. A little bit hard to say. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=627.88s)]
*  Staying in this period of uncertainty then, what are biotechs, what are the companies doing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=631.96s)]
*  to de-risk? How are they adapting their pitches to investors in order to show that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=638.44s)]
*  there's going to be less risk and that they're a good bet to make in this dynamic market? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=643.4000000000001s)]
*  It's definitely, I would say, the science piece. Companies are, management teams are looking at [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  improving the data that they can show to investors. Obviously, it's a little bit of chicken and egg [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  because sometimes you need to have the funding to be able to do those trials in order to come up [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=665.48s)]
*  with good data. At least on the data front, I think people are spending a lot of time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  What we also see is that there's much more due diligence going on and being offered to investors. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=679.88s)]
*  Another thing that I see, and that has always been important, but perhaps nowadays even [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=690.68s)]
*  more than before, is to spend time with sophisticated investors. If you're a management [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  team, you have a lot of experience, but if you then are able to build a relationship with a [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=704.36s)]
*  sophisticated, well-known investor, that also helps to open doors with other investors. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=710.6s)]
*  What about on the other side then? The investors have to balance the risk of going into an early [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=718.12s)]
*  stage biotech with the pressure that's always there to generate a quick return. What are they [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=723.0s)]
*  doing differently? Are they just investing in more due diligence or is there something else going on? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=730.04s)]
*  That's for sure. We see much more due diligence and timelines for doing deals get longer. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=735.4s)]
*  That's a certainty. I think there is also a focus on potentially less deals, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=743.48s)]
*  but then when they have identified a company in which they believe, you then also see that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=751.64s)]
*  sometimes they're willing to make a bigger investment. So de-risking it somewhat by doing [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=758.28s)]
*  less deals. Again, I wouldn't say a hurt mentality, but if investors see that certain other [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=764.68s)]
*  sophisticated, well-known investors are standing behind a transaction, that also helps in them [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  making the step and taking the decision to co-invest in a transaction. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=783.8s)]
*  Valuation is always a difficult thing in any deal. What we see today is that the whole discussion [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=790.5999999999999s)]
*  or the whole tension between the upfront investment and then the different additional [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=799.0s)]
*  milestones that need to be satisfied for additional funding. There's a lot of discussion [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  on that front as well, for sure. Before we jump out of funding and just talk about [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=811.96s)]
*  my next point here, what impact are we seeing in places like Belgium and the Netherlands, which [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=819.32s)]
*  are emerging hubs for biotech, but maybe not quite as established as what we would see in [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=825.6400000000001s)]
*  the UK, Oxford, Cambridge, or in Germany, for example? Where do they sit in this funding [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=831.32s)]
*  landscape? Is it harder to get money or are these jewels in the rough there that investors are going [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=836.68s)]
*  to find? I think there I don't see much change vis-à-vis to what we have seen before. I think [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=841.64s)]
*  what we do have in the Manilux is a couple of government institutions that are very much [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=853.16s)]
*  focused on providing funding to universities, to spin-outs, and to biotechs. Those funding [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  providers basically are still there. They haven't retracted, I would say. They still play their role, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=874.12s)]
*  so that really is important. We have the ecosystem. The ecosystem is still there, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=880.2s)]
*  and that keeps things still running. But then again, the situation is different nowadays, and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=885.16s)]
*  the risk has increased, so let's see how that will play out in the longer term. But when comparing [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=896.28s)]
*  the Manilux maybe with some other areas, I think it also goes in waves. I think we now have again [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=905.48s)]
*  a number of younger, less mature biotech companies that are going through the cycle. We had a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=912.8399999999999s)]
*  number of very mature ones like Ergenix, like Galapagos, and I think we're back in that kind [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=923.64s)]
*  of cycle. Whereas in other countries, other regions, you may have companies that are a bit [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=929.8s)]
*  more mature. So in that sense, I would say there is not much of a difference. But at least [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=936.04s)]
*  what I do see is that the ecosystem remains dedicated, notwithstanding all the headwinds [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=942.76s)]
*  that are there. So I guess if this is where we are, let's try and think a little bit forward. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=948.8399999999999s)]
*  I'll ask you to do a little bit of forecasting for me. Baker-Mackenzie is already pretty robust [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=955.0s)]
*  about where they think the deal volume is going to go in 2025. But there doesn't seem to be these [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=960.84s)]
*  IPOs anymore. The specs are becoming something that we're seeing fewer of as well. What sort of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=968.0400000000001s)]
*  deals should we be looking for in 2025? Well, I don't know when. Well, I do know we came out with [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  our forecast before the whole turmoil in the market started. So I think we need to recalibrate [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=983.32s)]
*  that initial forecast. But then again, where I do think you will see still deal flow is still in [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=993.16s)]
*  M&A. M&A doesn't go away, and particularly in areas where there's a lot of interest from [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1002.28s)]
*  Big Pharma in those therapeutic areas like oncology, like obesity treatments. I think that [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1012.44s)]
*  will not go away. What we do think or do expect is that the kind of carve out transactions where [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1021.8800000000001s)]
*  Big Pharma tries to spin out certain business lines, certain activities are no longer core, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1033.0s)]
*  there might be less deals of that nature in the immediate near future. But again, let's see how [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1039.0s)]
*  these things will pan out at the end of the day. When we're talking about M&A, the particular [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1049.56s)]
*  therapeutic areas we're talking about, is it mainly oncology? Are we also talking in neuroscience and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1057.32s)]
*  metabolic disease, rare disease? Yeah, I mean, it's a bit of a mix. I think [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1063.96s)]
*  what we organized one of our own industry events a couple of weeks ago, and some of the data that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1069.72s)]
*  was shown to us really suggested that there was a lot of deal activity to be expected, particularly [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1079.0s)]
*  in oncology and metabolic diseases and obesity. But again, neurodiseases still [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1087.96s)]
*  represent a lot of unmet medical needs. Just a few examples on deals that we are working on internally, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1097.48s)]
*  I think there is still a lot of interest there, because also the potential upside could be quite [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1106.8400000000001s)]
*  big there. But again, it's really those areas that are almost fashionable, like obesity [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1113.56s)]
*  and these things, and oncology has never gone away. Unfortunately, some cancers are [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1123.24s)]
*  more easy to treat, but that's not the case for all cancers. And there are still a lot of areas [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1133.32s)]
*  where you have a high mortality rate, and also not a lot of good treatments. So that still offers an [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1139.48s)]
*  area where you can still make a difference. Is Europe different in that regard, or is this [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1150.68s)]
*  really a global trend? You're seeing this in North America and the Asia Pacific as well, oncology is [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1158.6000000000001s)]
*  still leading the charge. Well, intuitively, I would say it's somewhat global. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1162.84s)]
*  With also, we must admit much more activity in the US and in Europe. The US has always been much [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1171.9599999999998s)]
*  more active, whereas in Europe, investors sometimes look at these types of opportunities [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1179.9599999999998s)]
*  through different lens. You mentioned also Asia and China. A very interesting trend that we saw [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1186.44s)]
*  was the out licensing from out of China that is taking place. So we see quite an uptick [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1197.64s)]
*  in transactions where basically Western companies look for R&D development in China. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1204.92s)]
*  So that's quite interesting. Who knows how sustainable it is. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1219.0s)]
*  But certainly the turmoil in the market isn't making that sort of deal any easier to do, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1223.88s)]
*  but it may not necessarily make it any harder either. How do these macroeconomic factors, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1232.76s)]
*  like high interest rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs, how do they start to influence first the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1238.28s)]
*  size and the structure of the deals that people are putting together? Definitely size. Maybe not [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1245.4s)]
*  so much for big pharma, but more institutional investors that try to fund transactions [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1253.0s)]
*  with leverage. Immediately you see that higher interest rates will impact deal size, but also [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1261.3999999999999s)]
*  deal appetite. When deals become more expensive, then you see somewhat of a [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1271.8s)]
*  reduction in the deal volume and deal size. So yeah, that's something that we see not only in [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1278.76s)]
*  healthcare, by the way, but just across different sectors. And that's an effect that is almost [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1286.44s)]
*  immediately. And that hasn't started in the beginning of April. That was already a trend [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1293.08s)]
*  that started off a couple of months ago. So yeah, that's definitely what you see. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1301.3999999999999s)]
*  And also, I mean, more focus on due diligence. When deals become much more difficult, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1308.2s)]
*  you spend much more time on trying to de-risk it. So then due diligence point comes back. I mean, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1316.6000000000001s)]
*  the whole point about what's the proper valuation, these discussions are now a bit more, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1324.52s)]
*  I would say on the forefront than before. What's the best price? How can you bridge the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1330.76s)]
*  expectation of sellers and then your own calculations? I mean, discussions on [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  earnouts and milestone payments. They're definitely there. What we also see, and that is also a trend [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1345.24s)]
*  that has never gone away. And maybe it's a trend that is becoming much more prevalent nowadays, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1355.5600000000002s)]
*  is that instead of M&A, some companies are looking at licensing transactions as an alternative. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1361.8s)]
*  Yeah, I guess if you're talking about de-risking a deal, and also the deal size, let's talk a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1370.12s)]
*  little bit about these earnouts and about these milestone payments, because that's one way of [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1376.84s)]
*  de-risking a deal over and putting it over the longer term as well. Is that becoming more [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1381.8799999999999s)]
*  prevalent for biotechs in Europe in particular? Well, it's definitely much more part of the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1386.36s)]
*  immediate conversation, I would say. I think the number of deals where there are milestone payments [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1394.52s)]
*  is just increasing versus a deal where you can just immediately take your purchase price and then [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1404.84s)]
*  walk away, so to say. It's almost in every transaction that we're talking about involving [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1413.48s)]
*  biotech there as a conversation about milestone payments and earnouts for sure. Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1421.16s)]
*  Let's turn now to talking about some other ways of financing then. If the IPO is gone away, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1428.3600000000001s)]
*  if VC funding is getting harder to secure in times that are really dynamic and kinetic, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1435.88s)]
*  what other financing options are there for biotechs? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1442.04s)]
*  Well, we need to make a distinction between private companies and listed companies. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1447.1599999999999s)]
*  I think for private companies, it's still, I would say, the context is a little bit easier [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1454.04s)]
*  than it is for listed companies. Maybe to start with the listed companies, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1463.1599999999999s)]
*  there is a lot of anxiety in that space, as you can imagine. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1471.56s)]
*  Companies that haven't been able to secure their cash runway, they really are getting more and more [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1476.52s)]
*  nervous. That's, I would say, almost everywhere in the case. What we expect to see, we don't hope to [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1482.9199999999998s)]
*  see, but what we expect to see, there are likely to be some cases where some of these companies, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1494.28s)]
*  if they're not safe, if they're not able to sell assets or raise cash, might go into more [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1499.32s)]
*  dramatic situations and solvency. What I personally think is also that you would see [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1508.6s)]
*  forms of financing that are maybe not the most elegant ways of financing, but more complex and [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1517.8s)]
*  rescue-type funding. There, you always see in these types of circumstances forms like equity [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1525.48s)]
*  line funding. Basically, funding by some very specialized investors that invest into a derivative [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1537.0s)]
*  product, also convertible funding is something that you might see a bit more. Again, it's all [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1548.12s)]
*  about what is available and what is achievable for these companies. Particularly, when listed, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1557.56s)]
*  that's not always that easy. For private companies, they don't have that same kind of issue. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1567.4799999999998s)]
*  There, I think what we see is that there are much more frank discussions with existing shareholders [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1573.0800000000002s)]
*  about how much they are still willing to support a company. There also, I think there's also a bit [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1579.8s)]
*  more freedom in restructuring a transaction or being a bit more dilutive than you would otherwise [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1585.88s)]
*  be able to achieve in these kinds of circumstances. Let's consider somebody taking on or a biotech [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1592.44s)]
*  company taking on some of these more complex alternatives, something like a convertible bond [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1601.16s)]
*  offering. What should they be weighing up when they're making this decision? Is it really an [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1606.0400000000002s)]
*  all-or-nothing gamble that they're going to go bankrupt if they don't do it? Or are there other [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1612.92s)]
*  things that they need to be thinking about longer term where this is actually the best of a couple [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1618.2s)]
*  of different options? Well, when you're faced with a cash crunch, you need to weigh all the options, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1622.6000000000001s)]
*  and sometimes the solution is not just one form of financing but just a combination of different [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1629.96s)]
*  forms of financing. Then a convertible solution or another type of solution might just be one extra [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1634.28s)]
*  chip that you can put on the table or an extra tool that you have in your toolbox. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1643.56s)]
*  Sometimes a little bit of funding via that route saves another day and allows you to continue having [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1648.04s)]
*  conversations with other investors. When we have those conversations, we also stress that it does [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1660.04s)]
*  not need to be only that type of funding, but it can be that combination of funding. What you then [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1668.6s)]
*  need to ensure is that you don't close doors when structuring different forms of funding. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1674.04s)]
*  For example, if a biotech ends up in a cash crunch and they turn to a big pharma company for [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1681.0s)]
*  some sort of bridging finance, what's the trade-off there? What's the problem that they might find [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1689.0s)]
*  themselves in a couple of years' hands? Well, it's often the quick pro quo in these types of [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1694.36s)]
*  deals. When it's funding from big pharma or from another institutional investor, what type of [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1705.08s)]
*  collateral do you need to give? As long as you're not on default, that's easy, but sometimes these [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1711.9599999999998s)]
*  deals can be combined with forms of licensing transactions. Some licensing transactions are [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1718.44s)]
*  basically M&A transactions. You need to weigh that with the question, how easy will it be for [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1726.2s)]
*  other investors to come in at that moment in time when you have already an important investor or [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1738.1200000000001s)]
*  a big pharma company sitting in your capital or having very important almost exclusivity on [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1743.4s)]
*  your main assets. That's something that you need to weigh. Those are not easy conversations to have. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1751.16s)]
*  It's always that balance, though, really, between getting the short-term cash to be able to continue [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1761.5600000000002s)]
*  the work, continue in the clinic, and the longer-term goal of actually taking something to market. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1766.68s)]
*  Absolutely. These types of funding are also very expensive, not only in terms of the interest rate [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1772.7600000000002s)]
*  and similar costs, but also some additional fees that are sometimes imposed by those investors, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1783.3200000000002s)]
*  the dilutive impact on existing shareholders. That's definitely something that you have to [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1790.44s)]
*  weigh in the mix. Sometimes that's still to be preferred over going into insolvency, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1797.88s)]
*  because that often means that the science may go away. You need to be able to continue [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1804.6000000000001s)]
*  your clinical trials. You need to be able to continue with your team. If your team is no [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1811.96s)]
*  longer there, that may just mean the end of the science, and that may then be a loss not only [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1817.64s)]
*  for the company, but also for the patient that could have been treated by that science. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1825.48s)]
*  All of these things, I think, need to be carefully considered. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1831.48s)]
*  I guess when we talk about having these sorts of considerations, it's great for biotechs who are [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1835.4s)]
*  fantastic at science and particularly really small teams that are fantastic at developing new [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1841.48s)]
*  molecules and new treatments. How early do they have to bring in outside advisors to help them [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1847.16s)]
*  through the finance? Is that something they want to do very early on, or are they going to wait [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1853.48s)]
*  until it's a little bit later to bring in some experts from outside? What would be your advice? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1857.8000000000002s)]
*  When I look at the management teams that have been really successful recently, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1867.16s)]
*  you often see that these management teams have team members that have a history as an outside [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1874.76s)]
*  advisor. These teams not only include the scientists, but also include people [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1881.0s)]
*  with an investment banking background and an analyst background. That's one way of getting [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1889.16s)]
*  the kind of views and the expertise that you would normally get from outside advisors. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1896.84s)]
*  That's definitely something that one can consider when wanting to start something up. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1903.96s)]
*  But in general, if people ask, should we already start hiring people? It's the element of cost. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1909.0s)]
*  You only have one dollar or one euro and you need to decide how to invest it in the best possible [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1919.56s)]
*  way. That does not always mean that the outside advisors are the best investment. But there are [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1925.0s)]
*  still some benefits in keeping lines open to have a dialogue with people that can help [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1932.4399999999998s)]
*  and that you can use as a kind of a sounding board. Because things are dynamic during [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1940.12s)]
*  the development process and the trial process, many things can happen. You need to be able to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1948.6s)]
*  deal with all the unknowns. Then it sometimes helps in having a good network and knowing people [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1956.44s)]
*  with whom you can test ideas, whom you can bring into the tent if it's needed. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1966.6000000000001s)]
*  And again, it's not always the teams, also the type of investors that you have in your capital. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1973.88s)]
*  They usually are, the good examples you see, that these investors do not only provide the cash, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1979.6399999999999s)]
*  but also provide the expertise and help these management teams in their R&D and in their [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1988.6s)]
*  planning and in their strategic thinking. So it's a combination of all these things. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=1995.96s)]
*  Let's think about this dynamism. We're in a very dynamic time right now. There's an awful [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2003.0s)]
*  lot going on in the world right now. But if we can forecast a little bit further ahead into [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2008.44s)]
*  2026 and beyond, if this year is all about getting through negotiating this dynamism, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2013.64s)]
*  making sure you keep the doors open, getting the deals in place that will see you through to the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2020.52s)]
*  next round of clinical trials, what sort of trends are you seeing for beyond this period, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2024.92s)]
*  for next year, the year beyond? What should we be watching for? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2030.44s)]
*  It's a very difficult question. And I don't have an immediate answer to that. I think [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2034.2s)]
*  extending the cash runway is an important one, bringing back stability. And if market [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2048.36s)]
*  circumstances allow for it, what we might see again is much more capital markets activity. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2055.2400000000002s)]
*  Because that's clearly an activity that is not there today. I just got an email from [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2064.4399999999996s)]
*  Global Investment Bank sharing some market trends and market statistics. And [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2074.6s)]
*  next to the number of IPOs, there was a big black zero. So being also a capital markets lawyer, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2081.16s)]
*  that always hurts. So I think when we are through the current circumstances, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2090.28s)]
*  I think the situation may also become a bit more positive for these types of transactions. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2097.2400000000002s)]
*  We've talked about how there are certain therapeutic areas that seem to be in fashion, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2105.0800000000004s)]
*  that seem to be getting all of the interest. What about some of the emerging areas as well, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2109.0s)]
*  the artificial intelligence and machine learning in digital health as well? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2113.6400000000003s)]
*  Are we going to expect that there'll be more deals done in those areas too? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2118.52s)]
*  There is already a lot of activity in that area. And AI is part of the current ecosystem and [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2123.8s)]
*  landscape. I mean, companies are making use of AI already. You may now have more and more companies [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2133.32s)]
*  that are focusing on providing an AI solution for the healthcare space. But it's more and more [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2144.28s)]
*  companies embedding AI into their own development. With the emerging interest in AI, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2150.76s)]
*  what you may see more of is deals that are being pitched as AI deals. That's likely to be the case. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2159.32s)]
*  But then again, I think the way I look at it is that AI is now part of the deal making. It's part [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2168.2s)]
*  of the R&D. It's part of being active in the pharma field. So it may not trigger more deals. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2178.44s)]
*  It may just trigger more and better science. And that better science then leads to more deals. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2191.56s)]
*  And finally, if we're talking about Europe as a region of its own in the world of biotech, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2199.16s)]
*  are there some things that this region can do to better position themselves, make them [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2205.16s)]
*  much more attractive for capital, more attractive for investors and try and catch up [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2209.56s)]
*  to these North American deals that are always a full step ahead of Europe? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2213.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think if, well, the question is, let me put it differently. Well, you may hear from the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2218.52s)]
*  hesitation that I have a couple of very strong ideas about this myself, and maybe a few of them [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  are a bit more, I would say, non-legal, I would say. But I think in terms of comparing Europe [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2233.8s)]
*  with the US, you definitely see that there are still a number of hurdles. And these hurdles [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2244.84s)]
*  have different sources, different origins. I think regulation may be one of those hurdles. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2253.88s)]
*  Also, Europe is still not integrated in the same way as the US. And I think working on all these [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2262.44s)]
*  different factors, all these different elements may help in improving the landscape in Europe or [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2272.68s)]
*  making Europe a bit more attractive. And again, who knows where things will go with the current [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2283.0s)]
*  situation. If you see that it is also a bit more difficult for science institutions across the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2292.6s)]
*  Atlantic to continue with their development programs, that also offers challenges, but [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2304.68s)]
*  at the same time, certain, I would say, opportunities for Europe. So I think a lot of smart people [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2310.44s)]
*  will for sure be looking at this at this stage, and they will probably not only see the challenges, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2319.64s)]
*  but also the opportunities. And on that positive note, I want to thank you, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2325.96s)]
*  Rul, for joining us today. It was great having you on Beyond Biotech. My pleasure. Thank you. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLcwVXbt4Zk&t=2329.8799999999997s)]
