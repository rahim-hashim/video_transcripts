Video Description: This week, we have a conversation about clinical trial design with Gen Li, the president and founder of Phesi, a global provider of patient-centric data analysis. 


Earlier this year, Phesi’s global analysis of all clinical trials conducted in 2023 revealed that more than a quarter (28%) of trials were cancelled during phase II – above the average attrition rate of 20% before 2020. 



00:39-01:31: About Phesi
01:31-01:49: Is your database global?
01:49-03:08: How successful are the different phases of clinical trials?
03:08-04:29: What are the biggest challenges for clinical trials currently?
04:29-06:23: Are clinical trials improving?
06:23-08:14: How can data improve clinical trials?
08:14-10:47: How does artificial intelligence affect clinical trial design?
10:47-12:53: Can clinical trial costs be reduced?
12:53-15:15: Can clinical trial times be shortened? 
15:15-18:21: Can data help with clinical trial diversity?
18:21-19:46: How can you fill knowledge gaps?
19:46-22:01: Do you have less data for rare diseases?
22:01-23:28: How does your company help with clinical trial design?
23:28-25:12: What kind of solutions can you provide?

# Overcoming clinical trial challenges
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 92. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. This week we're covering the challenges of clinical [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=16.86s)]
*  trials and how big data and data analysis can help in a conversation with Jen Li, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=23.34s)]
*  president and founder of Fesai, a global provider of patient-centric data analysis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=29.94s)]
*  Alright, so to get things started, I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about the company. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=37.66s)]
*  Yeah, Fesai is a clinical data science company. We use data to help pharmaceutical companies and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=43.78s)]
*  biotech companies to answer their questions and solve their problems, eventually supporting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=51.86s)]
*  them to bring innovative medicine to patients in need. We have a technology platform called [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=60.62s)]
*  Trials Accelerator. At the core of that, Trials Accelerator is a global and also [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=67.58s)]
*  a contextualized database with data collected from 108 million patients. So that is the core [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=75.98s)]
*  of our competitive data advantage. Is that a global database? It's a global, it's a contextualized, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=87.86s)]
*  which means we know who collected those data, when they collect those data, where they collect [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  data, according to what kind of design to collect those data. I wonder if you could maybe give me [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=104.5s)]
*  some statistics related to the success of the different phases of clinical trials? Yeah, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=111.02s)]
*  I think that there are different numbers being published in different places, but the picture, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=118.78s)]
*  it's not ready. We all know. At the end, there are less than 10% of those getting into human phases [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=126.22s)]
*  eventually become medicine we can use on patients, which if you're looking at a spread [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=136.86s)]
*  determination or attrition rate, the larger chunk of them happen between phase one and phase two. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=143.34s)]
*  That's probably more than 50%. Then 30% of them will not be able to go through the phase two, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=149.5s)]
*  and then another 25% also are lost in the phase three. We are not actually seeing any [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=157.1s)]
*  improvement in terms of that, but we are hoping that with the progress of those biomarkers, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=164.38s)]
*  the specificity of the things we're going into the treatment, that kind of rate hopefully [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=173.18s)]
*  can improve particularly in cancer areas. I think we can see some uptick in trend. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=180.3s)]
*  What are the biggest challenges facing clinical trials at the moment? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=188.06s)]
*  Many years ago, one of the senior leaders in the industry told me in his struggle was the clinical [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  trials never get started. Once they get started, they never get an end. Have we changed in that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=200.62s)]
*  situation? No. The issue of the former scenario is that we can't get a consensus on a design [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=207.34s)]
*  of a protocol. There are so many of the other things going along with it, but the call [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=217.02s)]
*  is the design would be debated, it'd be debated, debated. At the end, we still get a problematic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=223.02s)]
*  trial going into implementation. Then the reason never get ended is because we can't get the right [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=229.98s)]
*  alignment between the patient and the design, and we get trouble in the patient recruitment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=239.02s)]
*  Patient recruitment and design and clinical trials are the two evergreen kind of challenges facing us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=245.5s)]
*  I don't think we have made any material difference over the years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=252.22s)]
*  I think you have your opinions as well, but it would be interesting for us to have some debate, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=258.38s)]
*  not in this format, but later on. Do you think that clinical trial success is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  improving or it's about the same or it's getting worse? We cannot actually see any decisive move [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=273.42s)]
*  from the data we have, but interestingly, at the meantime, COVID-19 definitely had an impact [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=281.5s)]
*  to the business. The impact can be actually in two different ways. One is the positive aspect of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  impact, where they forced us to look at some of the technologies. How can we utilize them [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=303.58s)]
*  to improve the efficiency of clinical trials? One, the wearable of the devices, we can use [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=311.82s)]
*  to remotely recollect data from patients. Another one is decentralized clinical trials, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=319.5s)]
*  where we hopefully can use some of the technologies to avoid or minimize the need [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  for patients to come to the clinic. At the same time, we can collect the needed data to conduct [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=332.46s)]
*  clinical trials. And the negative aspect is that from our analysis, we see a very significant [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=338.78s)]
*  uptake of the termination rate of the phase two. We don't completely understand what are the reasons [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=347.5s)]
*  costed and there is a possibility the quality may have been negatively impacted. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=355.42s)]
*  But as you can imagine, if we're seeing the phase two increase in termination rate, those are the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  trials at the green zones will somehow sneak through. And so we will be seeing a lasting impact [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=368.54s)]
*  later on in possibly increased phase three termination rate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=377.42s)]
*  Now, how does the use of data improve clinical trials? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  Data can help us to improve the clinical trial in several different aspects. One, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  it can actually introduce a lot of objectivity. So for example, there are lengthy complicated [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=394.22s)]
*  debating on a variety of different designs of the trials. But if we can introduce data to look at [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=403.1s)]
*  the patients they are trying to treat and looking at the design elements, those are the things [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=410.62s)]
*  discrepancy being between can be fairly quickly leading to more objective conclusions, resulting [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=416.94s)]
*  actually improved not only faster, but also improved the design of the trial. It also, because of the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=425.1s)]
*  introduced objectivity, will make the communication easier. The communication would be easier among the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  various of the stakeholders around the clinical trials. Even between the regulatory authorities [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=440.78s)]
*  and the sponsor of the clinical trials, that communication can be also improved because of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=447.17999999999995s)]
*  data as well. The often situation is the FDA, it's a cozy political and medical kind of body. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=452.14s)]
*  They have their stakeholders needed to be taken care of. Oftentimes, they ask going to the special [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=461.42s)]
*  population to do certain trials. But if you're using data, you can decisively tell some of the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=467.98s)]
*  trials just simply cannot be done. It will improve the communication, it will have objectivity in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=474.86s)]
*  discussion. It can also result, improve the efficiency as well, because the data do can [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  help us identify quantitatively the opportunities for improvement. How is artificial intelligence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=488.86s)]
*  and machine learning impacting clinical trials, both the design and the execution of the clinical [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=496.3s)]
*  trials? Very interesting topic. There are a lot of hybrids. There are also realities in this. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=502.54s)]
*  I personally believe artificial intelligence, big data and other big data technology [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=510.7s)]
*  not only have bright future in clinical trials and clinical development, but there are some of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=518.5400000000001s)]
*  the things that are already happening in the first eye platform. Our investigator capability [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  inside of that platform is already artificial intelligence based. If you're looking around [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=534.22s)]
*  for any of the reasonable, capable investigators, you will find a detailed profile in our profile [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=543.34s)]
*  file just by putting very simple names. You will get the history of doing clinical trials, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=551.34s)]
*  their performance in doing those clinical trials, their medical expertise in doing clinical trials, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=558.1400000000001s)]
*  their past and current workload look like, and the way of the specific agents they have been [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  worked with along the history of their engagement in clinical trials. That is already reality. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  In the design of the clinical trials, we are making great progress. We're not necessarily [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=583.82s)]
*  can say the whole thing has been based on artificial intelligence, but we are firmly [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=590.86s)]
*  working towards that direction. What I meant is that by writing on that contextualized global [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=597.74s)]
*  108 million patient data, we can construct digital patient profile, allow the sponsor [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=605.9s)]
*  to meet their patient digitally before even they started the clinical trial. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=613.5s)]
*  That is the kind of energy they can actually leverage to design a much better protocol [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=621.1s)]
*  to avoid those costly amendments down the road. I'm looking forward to materialize more of those [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=628.46s)]
*  aspects in supporting our clients in the planning and implementation of clinical trials. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=638.46s)]
*  Is it, I guess, a lot of the money that biotech companies spend goes into clinical trials [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=647.18s)]
*  and they're not always successful. I wonder, is there a way to improve efficiency and also [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=655.02s)]
*  reduce costs? Yes, I love this question simply because it's very cost business in [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=664.22s)]
*  clinical development to begin with. The magnitude is something we needed to be very careful about. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=672.22s)]
*  While we are talking about enrollment improvement, we're talking about shortening the cycle time, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=683.34s)]
*  and et cetera, there is also a trunk of clinical trials. They actually should have never get started. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=693.26s)]
*  There are clinical trials. Fundamentally, we can use data to illustrate that the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=701.02s)]
*  target of the patient population does not exist. It is in our practice we have prevented several [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=708.46s)]
*  such clinical trials from getting started. Then there are other situations you may have actually [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=716.0600000000001s)]
*  defined the wrong outcome and the whole philosophy of the treatment might be incorrect. Therefore, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=722.86s)]
*  you will result in approved medicine cannot sell. That is also the truth. Those are much [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=734.38s)]
*  larger magnitude of the issues can be actually supported by data analysis to minimize those [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=744.22s)]
*  exposure of risk in clinical development. Of course, the evergreen of the challenging of [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=752.94s)]
*  getting better protocol and getting better sites or improving enrollment rate, those are the things [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  are still vitally important because those are the red and bottom of our business. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=767.82s)]
*  I guess associated with that, is there a way to make the timelines shorter? Of course, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=773.34s)]
*  it will save money, but I guess the most important thing is getting new drugs to patients. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=780.22s)]
*  Yes, indeed. The cycle time, let's just focus on the cycle time of conducting clinical trials. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=786.62s)]
*  There are several categories of the things we can do to shorten the cycle times. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  Oftentimes, if we wanted to get the best results, we need to have a concerted effort in doing that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=802.7s)]
*  One is to have a better design of the protocol. That better design of the protocol can help us to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=810.38s)]
*  avoid amendments. Each amendment costs several months and about $500,000. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=817.6600000000001s)]
*  Those are the things if we are using the patient data to do a better design of the trial, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=827.34s)]
*  those are the things that can be avoided. There is a cycle time benefit from that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=835.8199999999999s)]
*  The other aspect is the site selection part of it. The site selection is important. We have been [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=841.42s)]
*  making progress in selecting better sites, but on the other hand, the innovation, the medicine [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=849.66s)]
*  innovation also progressed. The progress of the way, we are now much, much more precise. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=856.06s)]
*  Earlier days, I'm sure you remember those days, that lung cancer is a lung cancer. Then we're [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=865.18s)]
*  looking at the long-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer. Then now, inside the long-small [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=871.7399999999999s)]
*  cell lung cancer alone, we are having over 20 different biomarkers. They are all different [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=877.02s)]
*  diseases. But in reality, we're still actually engaging the lung cancer doctor to do clinical [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=884.2199999999999s)]
*  trials. Sometimes they're not even lung cancer experts. They are just general cancer doctors. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=892.62s)]
*  You can imagine the level of the precision in the site selection is not there. Hopefully, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=900.54s)]
*  the AI and the data scientists we are working on, hopefully, we do have a solution in that space. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=907.66s)]
*  Can data help with things like recruitment and diversity? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=915.1s)]
*  Diversity is our analysis showing that 48% of the clinical trials does not include a single [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=920.86s)]
*  Hispanic patient unit. 43% of those clinical trials don't have a single African American [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=932.7s)]
*  patient unit, which is extremely problematic. Putting the question is, is it ethical? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=940.5400000000001s)]
*  For us to prescribe those medicines to those populations. The situation is dire. That's why [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=950.78s)]
*  the FDA started taking steps to gain into this. The industry tend to treat a lot of things like [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=959.02s)]
*  in the fat. This is an issue that should not be taken as something fashionable and et cetera. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=965.02s)]
*  It's a very serious business. The way of doing this one is not just artificially putting some [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=972.14s)]
*  plan to the record. You're asking for a plan, we give you a plan. We need to have some material [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=978.78s)]
*  improvement in that space, which is actually possible with the data we already have. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=986.14s)]
*  I'll give you the example. We can look at a particular disease, say stroke disease. We can [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=992.6999999999999s)]
*  look at acute ischemic stroke patients. Then we start looking at the ethical compositions [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1001.42s)]
*  resulted from the historical clinical trials and their ethical composition, racial composition. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1011.9s)]
*  Then we will be able to identify a batch of the sites are doing well in this diversification. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1019.9s)]
*  Some more and other ones are not very good. That contractive analysis will allow us to show [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1030.46s)]
*  what other specific things have been done by those achieved the better target. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1037.42s)]
*  Which allows us to go to the specifically defined hospitals and the doctors and to help us to improve [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1045.02s)]
*  the situation. What is happening in the industry is that they are giving some inspirational [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1054.54s)]
*  kind of target. Say we just want to reach 13% of the African-American patients in our clinical [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1061.98s)]
*  trials. But in reality, historically, the average is 3%. You know that the 13% is not realistic. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1070.62s)]
*  It's only inspirational. It's not helping anyone. We have to have much more objective ways [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1081.6599999999999s)]
*  to put in those incremental steps and take a pragmatic approach to achieve those [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1088.54s)]
*  improvement realistically, not just by inspiration. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1096.22s)]
*  Talking about diversity in terms of race, but there's also age, there's gender. How do you go [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1101.4199999999998s)]
*  about filling those knowledge gaps that exist? There is no easy way to fill those kind of gaps. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1108.86s)]
*  We firmly believe the technical solutions are already there. For most of the things we were [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1118.06s)]
*  talking about, the technical solutions are already there. But the challenging is to change people's [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1126.54s)]
*  thinking, changing people's mind. That's why that is the value of the conversation we have now. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1133.58s)]
*  It's so valuable that we needed to work in a concerted way to have all of the stakeholders [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1140.22s)]
*  to be educated, to be with all of those possibilities and with those also realistic [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1148.62s)]
*  solutions. Then we're working together, including the pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1156.06s)]
*  companies, the service providers like ourselves, like the patient advocacy groups, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1163.42s)]
*  like the health care providers, doctors and hospitals, all of those stakeholders, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1170.7s)]
*  regulatory authorities as well, to work together and make a concerted effort. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1176.22s)]
*  Then those gaps can materially be bridged. Are there big differences between diseases? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1181.02s)]
*  Some of the more rare diseases, do you have less data for those? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1189.9s)]
*  That's an interesting point. The simple answer is yes. The reality is the database FSI has been [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1194.86s)]
*  building. It's aiming for the totality of the data we have accumulated over the decades, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1204.78s)]
*  which inevitably they are going to be proportional to the human effort behind those diseases. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1214.3000000000002s)]
*  But the beauty of the clinical data sciences is it allows us to bridge from some of the known areas [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1222.94s)]
*  to the unknown areas. What I mean is that even for a trial we have not extensively studied, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1231.66s)]
*  we have enough mathematical knowledge that can be derived to project certain things. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1242.1399999999999s)]
*  For example, years ago we helped with a clinical trial on a novel treatment associated with acute [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1250.22s)]
*  lymphoblastic leukemia. At that point in time, there was no the largest clinical trial [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1259.02s)]
*  down. At that point, it was around five sites. They wanted to use 200 sites, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1265.34s)]
*  never being in that scale before. The candidate we're working on is such a good candidate, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1272.1399999999999s)]
*  so everyone is so excited that the center management has said to this team, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1279.1s)]
*  how much money do you want? I'll give you the money and you go ahead and do that trial in 11 [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1284.54s)]
*  months. We can look at all of the aspects and looking at the performance of the sites and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1290.78s)]
*  looking at the enrollment rate. We can use this once to project a much larger size of the trial, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1298.62s)]
*  200 sites. Then we conclusively told the team that you will not be able to finish this trial [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1306.7s)]
*  short of 30 months. In reality, they got it somewhere around 31 months. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1314.46s)]
*  Are you overall optimistic that clinical trials can be improved and helped? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1321.5s)]
*  Absolutely, but it's not going to be easy. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1328.22s)]
*  Can you run me through how your company fits into the picture? Do companies come to you [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1333.2600000000002s)]
*  and you help them design the clinical trials or at what stage do you get involved? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1341.5s)]
*  A fascinating question. We have our own ideal kind of situation, but we also have things that in [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1348.46s)]
*  reality we have delivered. If you're looking at the FDA guidelines in this space, what they are [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1356.6200000000001s)]
*  saying is that if you want to deploy artificial intelligence and you want to do those big data [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1366.3s)]
*  technologies, you need to involve us early. You need to involve us consistently and you need to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1373.34s)]
*  involve us all the time on everything you do. In reality, we still get a lot of rescue [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1381.5s)]
*  situations. They run into trouble, but the good thing is that those are the rescue situations [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1390.06s)]
*  are also the opportunity for us to grow more patient. The most frequent feedback we are hearing [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1398.62s)]
*  them says that we wish you were here earlier. Obviously everyone's different, but do companies [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1405.58s)]
*  come to you and say, how can you help us with this clinical trial? Are you able to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1412.46s)]
*  shape things or do they already have a very set idea of how they want to proceed? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  We are by and large still working on the kind of individual clinical trials, even on some of the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1423.8200000000002s)]
*  things we involved early on. Sometimes we get a cluster of clinical trials where we help, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1432.8600000000001s)]
*  but interestingly, just in the past six months or so, we started getting requests from the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1439.82s)]
*  companies for the packaged solutions, which they wanted to internalize some of the things we do. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1449.02s)]
*  We can provide a technical platform for them. They can put in people around. Then we can actually [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1456.78s)]
*  use that platform and build it with the services from us to support them. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1463.74s)]
*  That is not easy for them. It's not easy for us as well, simply because of the complexity of the [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1469.9s)]
*  clinical development business in itself. You can't easily have just a press button kind of solutions. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1477.98s)]
*  If someone has that one, I would question, is that real? That does not mean we cannot scale up this. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1487.9s)]
*  We will firmly go into the space, having more of those functionalities being internalized by our [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1496.7s)]
*  clients and to allow more programs to benefit from our capabilities. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1504.62s)]
*  It's always good to get behind the scenes a little bit to discover how patients can be helped [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1517.34s)]
*  through the improvement of clinical trials, whether that's efficiency, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1523.26s)]
*  saving time or saving money, or maybe a combination of all of them. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUnY3DVC2Hw&t=1532.94s)]
