# Antisense oligonucleotides
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 95. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly podcast from LeBioTek. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=15.0s)]
*  This week we will find out all about anti-sense oligonucleotides, which fortunately is a lot [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=20.48s)]
*  easier to say as ASOs. This week we had a chat with René Rueckert, chief operating officer at [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=27.44s)]
*  Izarna Therapeutics, who explains transforming growth factor beta, or beta depending on which [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=35.28s)]
*  side of the Atlantic you are, and anti-sense oligonucleotides and their role in tackling [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=42.72s)]
*  disease, including Izarna's own work on wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=48.72s)]
*  edema. So I wonder if first you could tell me something about the company? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=57.36s)]
*  Yes, I actually worked for Izarna Therapeutics for six years already. I started in 2018 as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=63.36s)]
*  the chief medical officer, then a year later we could get a real expert in the field we're working [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=71.52s)]
*  in. So Professor Marion Munk is a retina specialist and so she took over the CMO position and I do [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=77.12s)]
*  COO, so all the operational stuff since then for Izarna. Izarna itself is a company based just out [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=84.48s)]
*  of Munich. It was founded in 1998 already, very early, so way before my time. There were many, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=91.28s)]
*  many changes on size, the location and people, so none of the founders is associated anymore. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  And I've been working and surviving for almost 25 years, which is for a biotech startup, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=107.28s)]
*  very, very long time. Part of this survival strategy is obviously investment by MIG, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=115.04s)]
*  MIG are investment in Munich and they are still the key investor in Izarna Therapeutics. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=120.48s)]
*  The company was called Antisense Pharma actually in the beginning, so the idea was really [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=128.88s)]
*  Antisense more or less from the beginning, but it was renamed, rebranded in 2013 as Izarna, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=134.56s)]
*  your Izarna Pharma then. Izarna actually is based on the river that runs to Munich, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=142.48s)]
*  so it's the Izar. Izarna is now a virtual company more or less. We have a handful of consultants, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=147.68s)]
*  I am one of them, we have spread over Europe and doing pretty good since many, many years already, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=154.4s)]
*  so I think that is a business model that is cool. Maybe we could start if you could tell me a little [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=161.6s)]
*  bit about transforming growth factor beta and what the relevance is in diseases and disease [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=167.92s)]
*  treatment? Yeah, I'd like to. So transforming growth factor is a very complex kind of family [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=175.2s)]
*  of growth factors of proteins. It's called a super family, TTF-Beta super family, which is based on [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=183.2s)]
*  four different groups at 23 different genes that coding for members of this group. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=191.2s)]
*  There are very interesting, very important proteins that are part of the members, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=197.76s)]
*  bone morphogenic proteins, or BMPs. They are really essential for growth and neonatal development. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=202.64s)]
*  TTF-Beta is relevant for it, but TTF-Beta itself has different isoforms, so TTF-Beta 1, 2, 3. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=209.44s)]
*  I will later talk a bit more on TTF-Beta 2, which is what we are working on and trying to bring to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=218.88s)]
*  clinic. But TTF-Beta itself has a pleiotropic cytokine or pleiotropic cytokines that are involved [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=225.44s)]
*  in many, many different activities in the immune system and also in the morphologic activity in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=233.68s)]
*  body. Relevance here is also particular for our drug that we are developing is that TTF-Beta is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=242.8s)]
*  a key driver of fibrosis. Fibrosis is a process that is involved in many, many different pathologies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=249.44s)]
*  We are talking on eye pathology or ocular pathology, I think in a minute. But fibrosis is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  the key driver of pathology in the lungs. So pulmonary fibrosis, lung fibrosis is a very severe [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=261.6s)]
*  disease. I used to be a doctor in pulmonary medicine, a medical doctor in pulmonary medicine [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=268.48s)]
*  and clinic, and pulmonary fibrosis is something that is very hard to treat. TTF-Beta is one of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  the drivers for this. The other, I think, most important part of TTF-Beta placed in pathologies [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  is also liver fibrosis. There are many different reasons for this, but TTF-Beta is a key driver of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=284.72s)]
*  this fibrosis and I think that is also a part where this TTF-Beta is under heavy investigation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=293.04s)]
*  for different preclinical and clinical studies. Why is TTF-Beta a good target? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  It is based on this activity that I just mentioned. It's a good target particular for this fibrosis [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=309.44s)]
*  and inhibition of fibrosis if you inhibit TTF-Beta. And more about this in the ophthalmology [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=316.16s)]
*  in a minute, but TTF-Beta is a cytokine that is really significantly elevated in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=322.96s)]
*  fibroidic tissue in patients with fibrosis. TTF-Beta is produced by many different cells [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=330.4s)]
*  and is released or is stored intercellularly, but it is a good target since you can really [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=337.2s)]
*  suppress fibrosis. It has been shown in plenty, hundreds of publications, and therefore I think [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=346.0s)]
*  it's a good target for us in our niche or in our indication of tomology, but in particular also [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=351.12s)]
*  in other indications. And I mentioned probably for Isana still, we have this one molecule, TTF-Beta [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=358.4s)]
*  2 antisense, but we also studied TTF-Beta 1, TTF-Beta 3 antisense, and there are many, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=365.76s)]
*  many opportunities to go. What are antisense oligonucleotides and how do they work? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=373.36s)]
*  Antisense, it's been around for more than 30, 40 years. So I think 78 was the first mentioning of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  an antisense molecule in the research literature. Since then it has made a huge development in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=388.96s)]
*  technology and also like I say, drug ability of this technology. Antisense is a form of treatment [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=396.4s)]
*  and therapy that you can use that is based on oligonucleotides or the target messenger RNA. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=404.96s)]
*  So RNA obviously is very important for the protein production and production of every [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=415.6s)]
*  signaling molecule, every molecule in the body. This messenger RNA is obviously transcribed from [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=421.12s)]
*  DNA in the nucleus and then it goes to the ribosome and it's in the cell phytoplathin [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=429.6s)]
*  and it's transcribed into proteins, say a protein. The antisense is nucleotide that is designed [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=436.0s)]
*  particularly to target a very specific messenger RNA to inhibit this messenger RNA. The mRNA is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=444.88s)]
*  then degraded or it's just the transcription is inhibited. So there are different mechanisms [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=454.0s)]
*  how it can work. The antisense itself is really designed out of nucleotides that match the genetic [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=459.92s)]
*  code of the target. Say TGF-BETA has a particular genetic code and our antisense has exactly the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=467.36s)]
*  as antisense the code that is in RNA nucleotide that has a length of between 10 and 20 nucleotides. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=474.96s)]
*  The target is mRNA and prevents the development or the transcription of the protein. So really [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=483.2s)]
*  TGF-BETA production is inhibited and not like another disease of therapeutics is you just block [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  the protein that is already produced and it really targets very specifically one molecule. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=498.0s)]
*  And that is an antisense. There are many modifications of antisenses so to increase [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=505.28s)]
*  the stability otherwise the pure antisense is what I used in a lab 30 years ago or 25 years ago [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=511.12s)]
*  that was very very unstable and would never survive an injection in a human body since it was degraded [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=518.0s)]
*  and now there are plenty of different methods to stabilize it and really also add other molecules [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=524.32s)]
*  to target antisense particularly to the liver if you add some sugars. So it's a very interesting [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=531.84s)]
*  molecule. What is it useful for treating? Basically everything. Being biased as being [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=539.04s)]
*  in this antisense field but there are currently more than 10 molecules on the market or drugs on [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  the market that are based on antisense. I'm still surprised that not more since again the treatment [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=553.76s)]
*  is very specific it really targets one molecule that could be responsible for one indication for [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  one disease. The main indication of approved treatments are often diseases. So kind of neurological [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=567.6s)]
*  diseases also infectious diseases are part of what has been approved. I can talk about this in a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  second but there are now studies going on in way large say more important also commercially more [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=582.88s)]
*  attractive indications like lipid overproduction and also cardiac pathologies so that is where [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=590.24s)]
*  I think the trend is going to larger indications. What advantages do ASOs have? It's a very very [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=599.2s)]
*  specific treatment and let me point it to look at other treatments that disadvantages of say [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=607.28s)]
*  if you use an antibody which is obviously the largest market and I think from a commercial [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=615.6s)]
*  point of view the most attractive market at the moment to have antibodies against this and that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=621.84s)]
*  and many many different proteins so the so-called biologics they target molecules that have already [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=627.04s)]
*  been produced by the cell and also already released by the cells. So if you target interleukin 2 as an [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=633.12s)]
*  example interleukin 2 will be produced and will be released and if you want a block it you use an [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=640.96s)]
*  antibody and try to catch what has already been produced and released that is in the circulation [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  or has already bound to receptors and may have already have done some damage or some activity. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  In contrast antisense is really targeting again as mentioned interest cellularly the production [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  of such a cytokine as interleukin 2 or in our case TGF-BETA 2 so it's not released at all it's [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=667.36s)]
*  really you hit the target before it can do any damage or can even be produced and so that's a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=673.6s)]
*  major advantage. What are the different ways that ASOs can be delivered? That has also changed and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=679.2s)]
*  improved in the past so as I mentioned when I used the antisense technology to silence genes or the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=686.08s)]
*  production of some vectors in the lab 20-25 years ago it was a pure molecule a pure nucleotide that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=693.76s)]
*  was highly unstable. Now we can do a target as a targeted delivery and we could deliver antisense [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=701.28s)]
*  in different ways. So back then in the lab it was electroporation so high voltage dangerous things [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=711.3599999999999s)]
*  Now you can inject antisense and the most of the therapies I think all of the therapies that are [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=718.4s)]
*  approved at the moment are injected in some way. So we are talking about subcutaneous injection, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=723.92s)]
*  intravenous injection for neurologic diseases there is the intrataker so-called injection it's [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=730.0s)]
*  really into the spine into the into the liqueur but based on new development and I mentioned some [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=737.84s)]
*  modifications. There are new studies that really show also bioavailability via Orwell Gavage so we [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=744.96s)]
*  need to do it as a tablet and you can try therefore to make the therapy very easier [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=752.64s)]
*  which again makes it easier to target larger populations so for hypertension it would make [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  it very difficult if all hypertension patients need to come to the clinic to get an IV infusion [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  but if you can have just a tablet or pill with the antisense obviously that makes it easier [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=772.32s)]
*  that is cool stuff and cool developments. Is it still something that is developing and that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=777.5200000000001s)]
*  you're still working on and learning more about ASOs? Yes for sure. I mean we at ISANA we don't do [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  any basic research anymore. We're a very small company we are focusing on our clinical pipeline [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=792.96s)]
*  the one drug that we have in phase two now but there's plenty of research going on. I just [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=798.56s)]
*  checked today there were more than 25,000 papers in PubMed on antisense oligonucleotides which is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it's more than I expected. Again the technology or the ideas around since 78 [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=812.4799999999999s)]
*  it took quite a while before the drug first drug was approved and again compared to antibodies [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=819.1199999999999s)]
*  there are probably hundreds or so approved for different therapies with more than 10 antisense [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=825.68s)]
*  therapies approved and on the market for very few patients that often indication is still a surprise [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=830.4799999999999s)]
*  to me why not more companies are working on this and yeah I think it's promising approach. Also I [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=837.12s)]
*  think the formulation is the hottest topic saying okay how could you get the drug to become more [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  stable which is an important point of therapy and thinking and the doctor. There are recent data [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=851.6s)]
*  on new development new stabilization methods that show that the antisense could be stable for many [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=862.32s)]
*  many months. So we have our antisense on TGF-BETA to in animal models we have target engagement [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  and suppression of TGF-BETA seen out to four months for more than four months with a single [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=875.12s)]
*  injection. So that is something that is obviously promising also for other indications if you say [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=880.0s)]
*  you have a duration of effect for many many months even half a year so you would need two [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=886.0s)]
*  treatments a year and that's one of the developments that the antisense field is going to. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=892.4s)]
*  Are there any other challenges involved with ASOs? Not too many I would say it's it is the field that [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=898.0s)]
*  becomes more and more interesting and RNA technology became famous unfortunately to say [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=907.12s)]
*  just a few years ago with the COVID pandemic and BioNTech or Pfizer and their vaccine that it was [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=914.24s)]
*  based on kind of is also an antisense what was on RNA based drug and so we have I think a push in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=921.76s)]
*  this direction technology where antisense is really growing. There's another option also for [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=930.64s)]
*  antisense in oncology as I said we have TGF-BETA it also plays a role in oncology we have very early [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  preclinical data that has been generated many many years ago so we are not actively working on this [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=944.88s)]
*  but you can also generate antisense against not only messenger RNA which we know for [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=950.96s)]
*  decades already but also against microRNA for example so miRNA which is a non-coding RNA where [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=957.92s)]
*  everyone believed until five years ago that that's just junk RNA but it is not. There are very [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=967.28s)]
*  important molecules that regulate transcription and many many biology processes so both the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=973.52s)]
*  micro and non-transcribing RNA are particularly important in cancer pathology and therefore I think [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  it's a direction where it goes and where many many options are. Are there lots of companies working [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=987.2s)]
*  in the field right now? It's getting more. There are few companies so particular Ionis is a company [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=993.52s)]
*  that is mostly focused really on antisense I would say it's the market leader that has also [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  drugs on the market. More larger companies are getting into this and it's potential for growth [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  I would say. Are they best used as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with others? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1014.56s)]
*  It depends. We are just running a clinical trial and seen that it works in some patients as a [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1020.56s)]
*  monotherapy as a single treatment but also for other technologies there are particular cancer [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1025.76s)]
*  therapy there are many many treatments that have to be done with two or three or even more different [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  drugs to really get the cancer under control. The same is true here. You have few indications, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1038.96s)]
*  few pathologies that are really based on one single growth factor and if you target it you [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1048.16s)]
*  knock out the disease and you kind of cure or treat the patients. It's not too often in medicine [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  so often there's this multifactorial and you have to try therapy with different molecules but having [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1060.08s)]
*  said this again there's a potential particularly also for our drug that we just presented a few [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1067.2s)]
*  data three days ago at a huge ophthalmology meeting in Seattle we presented the monotherapy [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1073.04s)]
*  and we've seen pretty good efficacy so hope that we hold true in other studies. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1080.24s)]
*  Speaking of your own work could you tell me a bit about the pipeline that you have at Izana? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  It's small, it's too short but again Izana is a small company. We have one drug in clinical [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1092.08s)]
*  development that is called no one remember but it's called ISTH-0036. We don't even have a name [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1100.08s)]
*  yet so we are working on getting a real name to move forward which is a necessity for clinical [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  development but it's a drug that is target really on ophthalmology. I mentioned Izana had some [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1115.44s)]
*  oncology projects in the past when it was still called antisense pharma. We have preclinical data [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  on oncology, we have different molecules, antisense as I mentioned also targeting TGF-Beta1, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1128.88s)]
*  TGF-Beta3 which all could be relevant in fibrosis in oncology but also fibrosis. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  The idea is pulmonary fibrosis, lung fibrosis where you could even administer antisense as [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1142.08s)]
*  an inhalation as a spray so it's a pretty stable molecule if you do the right modification. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  The other thing still is liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis is something to be considered but the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1155.28s)]
*  pipeline itself is phase 2a molecule, this ISTH-0036 where we mentioned just Professor Mank [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  just the day before presented first data of our phase 2a study at the meeting and that's our [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1169.52s)]
*  pipeline. The indications are huge, it's a blockbuster indication as the age-related [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1176.48s)]
*  macular degeneration, it's AMD. The other indication we are treating in this study or [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1181.92s)]
*  patients we are treating are diabetic patients with so-called diabetic macular edema. Both are [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1187.76s)]
*  diseases of the retinas, back of the eye which are very frequent in older people. So AMD is [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1192.96s)]
*  the names that age-related, it's very frequent in people that are older than 60, 70 or 80 years [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1199.44s)]
*  and the diabetic becomes a pandemic more or less already. There are more people getting obese, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  that it's a global health issue and a big concern that more and more people get diabetes. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1211.76s)]
*  Associated with this is this also the eye part of the ocular pathology that is called diabetic [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1217.04s)]
*  macular edema. We actually seen good efficacy in both and we're just looking for a partner, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1222.0s)]
*  we are looking for investors or partners to continue the development of the drug. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1228.4s)]
*  Seen a good safety profile, also what I mentioned before, it's safety of anti-sense is very, very [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1234.24s)]
*  good as well as very few side effects. How does it work with AMD? Does it stop it or reverse it? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1239.28s)]
*  It's working differently to the gold standard. Currently the gold standard in ophthalmology [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1248.48s)]
*  in this AMD and DME are injections into the eye, so-called intravitro injections with drugs [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1255.12s)]
*  that are on the market for 15 years already. So the main players are Bayer, Novartis, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1262.32s)]
*  Genentech. So Aylia is one of the drugs that I actually used to help to develop with Bayer, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1269.52s)]
*  John Bayer 2006 in the headquarter and managed the trials of this ophthalmic disease. They work [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1277.36s)]
*  with blocking antibodies, blocking VGF, VGF is vascular endothelial growth factor and that is a [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  cytokine that makes a lot of edema in the eye. The drugs working pretty good already that are on the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1291.28s)]
*  market and others, Lucente, Faridzima, Bevabismo are on the market that all target the same molecule [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  and they work in the beginning very good against the edema but all the patients develop after [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1304.8s)]
*  half a year, a year and later on they develop a fibrosis and therefore the visual acuity, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1311.04s)]
*  the vision goes down and goes down and goes down. Even if you treat with the gold standard, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1315.44s)]
*  you can't do anything against it and our drug is working pretty good first against the edema. It's [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1320.0s)]
*  not probably not as efficient as the other gold standard. So you may to your question before, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1326.0s)]
*  we may need to have a combination therapy and a few selected patients but in most of the patients [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1331.6s)]
*  it works on its own with injection every other month. We could extend it to every three or four [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1338.32s)]
*  months hopefully and it really showed some benefit in suppressing the fibrosis and suppressing the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1344.0s)]
*  development of the fibrosis which is again the key concern as I asked on the medical need in this [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1351.84s)]
*  both indications the AMD and DME and our first data that we presented look very good. So looking [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1357.52s)]
*  forward to larger studies and then approval hopefully. What kind of timeline are you looking [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1364.0s)]
*  out for that? I mean you're in phase 2A now? As soon as possible. I mean it's obviously again we [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1369.2s)]
*  are finalizing the phase 2A at the moment while we're speaking and starting a phase 2B slash 3E [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1376.24s)]
*  whatever study with the right partner. So phase three studies in this indication [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1384.24s)]
*  meaning hundreds of patients, thousands of patients. So large programs in the past that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1391.76s)]
*  Rush, Novartis, Bayer, what we're doing had more than two dozen patients. So we're talking about [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1397.76s)]
*  a lot of money, a lot of effort but we're very optimistic. We are in partnering discussions. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1404.4s)]
*  Also while I'm speaking our CMO Mayan Mank is at the meeting talking to companies. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1410.0s)]
*  We hope to get it phase three then next year, end of next year. So phase 2B slash 3E kind of study [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1416.72s)]
*  which would bring us to an approval in less than a handful of years. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1425.44s)]
*  That's good. What would success be for the ISTH 0036 and what can patients expect? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1430.0s)]
*  Yeah if it is confirmed what we see right now is that we have a long-term treatment that [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1438.88s)]
*  really improves the visual acuity division of this older patients and keeps it stable for many, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1446.16s)]
*  many years. The current treatments are very effective in the beginning. They improve the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1452.0s)]
*  vision very fast. So you can see an effect even after 24 hours in some of the patients if you look [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1457.04s)]
*  into the eye. But even if you treat the most optimal use the most optimal treatment regimen, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1462.72s)]
*  you use monthly injection, you see after a few years that most of the patients develop fibrosis [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1469.84s)]
*  and the vision goes down, down, down, down, down which could lead to it after a few years of treatment [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1475.92s)]
*  to really legal blindness. So patients are not blind in the sense of it's everything is dark but [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1480.96s)]
*  they cannot read, they cannot see, they cannot drive, they cannot do anything else. You cannot [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1486.4s)]
*  focus anymore. With our drug we hope to prevent this progression of fibrosis which is causing [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1490.56s)]
*  this deterioration. So we hope that in the short time relatively short time frame we have a [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1496.8s)]
*  help for the patients and obviously become a very successful drug on the market. We are the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  more or less the only company that are working on this target. So also this is very fascinating and [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1512.08s)]
*  obviously helpful for ISANA. We have a product or drug molecule that could be once a drug on the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1517.6s)]
*  market that no one else is really working on. So most of the companies are working on improving [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1524.72s)]
*  the current gold standard therapies, the anti-VGF therapies with drugs that have a longer duration [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1530.24s)]
*  so you don't need to inject every month but you can inject every other month or every four months. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1535.44s)]
*  Some are working on gene therapies that actually reduces the need for injection even more since [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1540.6399999999999s)]
*  you produce the anti-VGF antibody in the eye, in the retina which is an interesting target but that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1546.88s)]
*  would not address that unmet medical need that we are targeting on fibrosis. So again we hope for [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1552.48s)]
*  huge potential for our drug that we are developing. Is there anything else that you wanted to mention [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1558.64s)]
*  that we hadn't? It's a very interesting field and I would encourage more people to have a look at [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeN6gONAqI&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
