# Cracking the code of biotech valuations
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 122. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. Our conversation this week is about financing. It's a very [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=17.68s)]
*  informative discussion on early stage biotech valuations, pipeline evaluations and much more, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=24.88s)]
*  including the developing Eastern European biotech scene. And so our guest on the podcast this week [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=32.64s)]
*  is the founder of Ambion, Adam Martak. To kick things off, I wonder if you could tell me a bit [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=40.08s)]
*  about the company. Sure, maybe I'll tell you just a little bit about what led to the company [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=48.4s)]
*  being founded. So I'm somebody who spent almost 10 years now on the commercial side of live [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=54.8s)]
*  census and back in 2020 I returned back to Slovakia to help shape the policy for reimbursement of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  drugs and medical devices, including setting up the agency. And I was getting some requests during [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=69.6s)]
*  the time for consulting on various matters, which I couldn't take as a state employee. So following [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=75.44s)]
*  my departure from the Ministry of Health, I set up the company purely initially for the reasons of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=80.88s)]
*  being able to invoice on these kind of odd projects that people were asking for me. And [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=86.96s)]
*  two and a half years later it's grown nicely in a kind of consulting company focusing on three main [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  service areas on the commercial side of life census. So business development, which is basically [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=100.88s)]
*  whatever you would understand under BD in the life census, meaning from direct sales all the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=107.28s)]
*  way to more complex feelings like licensing deals and we don't do any M&A, but anything between that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=113.92s)]
*  two ends. Market access, which concerns really the necessary steps that the companies need to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=120.16s)]
*  take to get the products to the reimbursement system in the respective countries. And tech transfer, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=127.28s)]
*  which is also partly the BD service line, but it's specifically focused on helping scientists and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=132.24s)]
*  academic institutions spinning off the intellectual property into a company in a successful and a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=139.12s)]
*  mutually beneficial way. So we've operated from Bratislava, Slovakia and been operating for about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=145.28s)]
*  two and a half years. Are many of your clients in Slovakia and Eastern Europe? Yeah, so that's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=152.4s)]
*  actually quite interesting. So we're headquartered in Bratislava, operating from Bratislava. I spent [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=158.0s)]
*  most of my career in Austria, in Vienna, so that was a natural tendency to focus more on Austria [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=162.96s)]
*  as a country, on the clients there. So I would say it's about 20 to 80 percent, meaning 20 or [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=169.36s)]
*  far 20 percent of our clients so far have been from Eastern Europe. The majority actually have been from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=176.24s)]
*  various countries in the EU. I think one of them was also from outside of the EU. We have clients [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=181.6s)]
*  from Eastern Europe, but it's definitely not the majority of clients that we have from Eastern Europe. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=187.44s)]
*  Is there much of a biotech or biopharmacine in that region? Very good question. And it's just to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=191.92s)]
*  be very frank about it or just to really pinpoint this. There are very great differences between [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=199.52s)]
*  countries in Eastern Europe in terms of how far the biotech scene has been developed. So [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=204.72s)]
*  here in Slovakia, unfortunately, I have to say, they're very much lagging behind, not just the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=209.52s)]
*  Western Europe, most of the Western European countries, but also lagging behind some of the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=215.76s)]
*  Eastern European neighbouring countries, which are typically compared to Slovakia as a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  benchmark. For example, in Lithuania recently there has been an initiative to build a seven billion, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=226.88s)]
*  or to invest seven billion dollars to build a bio city in Vilnius, in the capital of Lithuania, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=233.84s)]
*  which is going to be, in its finish, the largest biotech campus or biotech city, so to speak, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=239.44s)]
*  in Europe. In Estonia, there is a booming digital health scene and there is also activities when it [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=245.84s)]
*  comes to biotech in the Czech Republic and in Hungary. So it's picking up and there are great [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=251.52s)]
*  regional differences. That's the point I would like to emphasise. Is that kind of the key to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=256.48s)]
*  be differentiated in some way? Like you just mentioned that digital health in Estonia and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=263.68s)]
*  Lithuania is doing something slightly different. Is the key to try and focus on some kind of niche? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=269.44s)]
*  I think to an extent definitely, yes. So Estonia historically has been very strong in anything [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=275.92s)]
*  digital. So over the past 15 years, I think it's one of the most digitised countries in Europe. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=281.68s)]
*  There's also this option to get an e-residency in Estonia, like basically a second citizenship [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  almost. So naturally, the digital health as an area is something where Estonia could have built [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  on this foundation and it definitely, I think, is helping Estonia to gather the map of biotech as [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  such, just because it's already had this strong foundation. So I would say it's key if there's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  already strong foundation in the country. For example, in Austria, just as an example, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=312.96s)]
*  Austria or Vienna has had a very strong history of immunology and oncology research and the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  biotech scene in Austria has been basically built on this research. So it's much more developed, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  of course, than what you normally find in most of the Eastern European countries. But again, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=330.24s)]
*  the same principle, basic research or the background of the country, of the region in a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=334.56s)]
*  certain area, which was then utilised to break into the industry as such. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=340.32s)]
*  I spent a big chunk of my career in the innovation ecosystem in Austria and I also done, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  back in the years, my master thesis on the external funding sources of the live science [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=353.44s)]
*  start-ups in Austria. I was able to internet the governmental development bank in Austria, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=358.64s)]
*  the Austria Wearchart Service. And I would say that I was able to gather a fairly good idea [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=363.76s)]
*  of how the ecosystem developed. And it's been really quite interesting. Vienna has had, and then [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  also many other universities or institutions in Austria, have had strong backgrounds in different [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=375.68s)]
*  areas for long. So basic research in infectious diseases. So it's been very strong. And generally [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=383.36s)]
*  in Austria, Hungary has been one of the strongest research areas. But also in terms of oncology, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=389.68s)]
*  vaccine development and immunology as such. So it's been very heavily focused on certain areas. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=394.96s)]
*  So generally speaking, Austrian life science ecosystem about 30 years ago, so we're talking [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=402.56s)]
*  early, mid 90s, was non-existent, but it was not really as flourishing as now. So I was able to get [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  a lot of insights into how has the development of the ecosystem, how it has progressed. And there [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=417.84s)]
*  are basically a few pillars that I've seen that have really propelled the ecosystem to what it is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=422.64s)]
*  now with exits in the order of hundreds of millions in some cases. First thing that I've [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  identified is that there was a Bergen-Ingenheim, or let's say a big pharma company, a big private [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=433.04s)]
*  investor has decided to open a big research and development center in Vienna. So the Vienna Center [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  of DUI is one of the largest ones in the world for DUI. It's where all of the oncology development [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=444.64s)]
*  for BYU is being done. There's also a small animal health division. And why I think this was [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=451.04s)]
*  crucial is that it's produced certain critical mass of people that were well worse on the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=457.04s)]
*  R&D side. Not just with the basic research, they were able to do research, but they also [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=462.88s)]
*  they got insights into the stages of developing a drug, which has produced basically people, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=468.48s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people that are trained in this and just in the Vienna region. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=475.76s)]
*  Drug course companies like Takeda now, and then Pfizer and Novartis also with their manufacturing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  centers. But I think the Berger Center has played the major impact on how the ecosystem developed. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  Secondly, it was the early success, I think it was like the late 90s, early 2000s, when [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  few of the companies that were present already in Austria made a big success. So the same concept [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=502.0s)]
*  of a company making it to the IPO, I think one was called Intercell. So Intercell, I think, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=507.84s)]
*  was public. And a lot of people got rich because of this exit. And they also got experience of, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=513.12s)]
*  you know, running the company from the beginning to the end. That has also produced people who were [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  acting as kind of business angels in the environment. So now we have people who understand [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=524.8s)]
*  the R&D. Apart from the basic research, you have people with some kind of experience of success with [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=529.92s)]
*  funding, and they were acting as business angels. And the third, I would say the major thing is the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=536.4s)]
*  non-dilutive funding environment that is present in Austria. So I've done the master thesis research [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=543.12s)]
*  on this. And you can get more funding non-dilutive as an early stage biotech in Austria or in Vienna, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  specifically, than in Germany or in Switzerland. I counted it up, it's up to three and a half million, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  it was three and a half million several years ago, that you could get equity free in the form of grants [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=561.6s)]
*  or potentially loans that you had to pay back if you were successful, but essentially equity free. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  And this is absolutely crucial for the start, yeah, because for digital health and for IT companies, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=573.12s)]
*  most of them, you need two smart heads or a few smart heads and a laptop. And off you go. But with [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  biotech, it's extremely front loaded when it comes to the investment. And you need to sub your own [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  lab, you need to buy services from external parties. They're all really quite expensive, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=590.0s)]
*  especially for early stages. It's priceless to some kind of funding which covers your lab expenses, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=594.8s)]
*  your first stages of R&D. I've had people from the US asking me that, you know, I tell them about [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=601.76s)]
*  Vienna, about the Austrian ecosystem. They asked me, okay, but what is the quality of the companies? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=606.8s)]
*  And it's true that the private capital has typically does more rigorous due diligence on where to put [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=612.0s)]
*  the money. But still, for many, many companies that are now successful in Vienna or in Austria, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=618.4s)]
*  would not even have started, would not have even emerged had it not been for the funding they were [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=625.04s)]
*  able to get from either the funding agencies, the investment bank of the government, or even [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  the city of Vienna has granted it offers to the research companies. So this all gave rise to, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=637.36s)]
*  like, I would say almost like a perfect storm of propelling this forward. And Austrian life [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=643.6s)]
*  as ecosystem right now is one of the I don't want to say it's still not mature in terms of there's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=648.48s)]
*  still like gaps in the funding. But in the region of Central Europe is one of the most quickly growing [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=652.96s)]
*  ones. There have been recent exits. So my sugar, big exits, tennis, bioscience, also pretty large [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=661.44s)]
*  exit. So exits are happening already. I'm bringing this up because this is exactly I think the recipe [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  also all the other Eastern European countries, you need some kind of a critical knowledge, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  critical massive people where they've had some success, they've seen the product and the company [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  go from scratch all the way to, you know, IPO to an exit. Those are also the people that act as [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=683.7600000000001s)]
*  business angels and that can propel the whole industry in their respective countries forward. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=689.6s)]
*  I know that it would vary from company to company, but typically what kind of services [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=695.2800000000001s)]
*  do you see startups requiring? Yeah, it's quite often the case that I mean, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=700.88s)]
*  lives and spin offs or startups are particularly front loaded when it comes to the necessity of [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=705.92s)]
*  external capital and the accompanying R&D expenses. So apart from, you know, the mention [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=711.84s)]
*  digital health where it can really be that you need only, you know, a few laptops and smart heads [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=719.2s)]
*  to start a company. Typically, if you start a biotech startup, you need a lot of upfront [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=725.76s)]
*  investment and most of that investment is spent on R&D as such. That's for a quite a long time before [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=731.36s)]
*  you see any reasonable profit in the company. So it's quite often the case that the teams are [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=738.56s)]
*  almost completely or completely academic, quite often they've never done anything else apart from, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=744.24s)]
*  you know, academic research. Therefore, the startups or the spin offs in the biotech and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=748.96s)]
*  live sciences sectors, they often need support in areas like planning a future market access, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=754.24s)]
*  even starting to think about market access. It's very important to think about how your [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=760.64s)]
*  drug is eventually going to be reimbursed. Once you start developing the drug, it's actually [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=765.6s)]
*  one of the things that most startups do at the beginning. It's a mistake. Also securing funding, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=771.6s)]
*  kind of regulatory guidelines and helping with navigating the IP management landscape. So [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=777.04s)]
*  anything that is of commercial nature is quite often missing. Not always, not always, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=783.36s)]
*  but quite often is missing from early stage companies. What kind of services do you offer [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=790.32s)]
*  that can help startups? The services that we get paid for and that we can offer that bring the most [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=795.44s)]
*  value are compartmentalized industry service lines that I mentioned. So BD as business development is [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=801.2s)]
*  really a service where we offer anything from acting as an account management company or we [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=807.76s)]
*  allocate a person or people to a specific project where they act as account managers for a company. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=815.92s)]
*  They're trying to break into the region, trying to get the first market traction, all the way to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=821.92s)]
*  more complex things like navigating the product strategy, looking at the portfolio, making audit [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=826.64s)]
*  of the portfolio of the products or services that company is offering currently or the current [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=832.56s)]
*  commercial strategy and auditing the strategy. All the way to asset valuation. So we know, let's say, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=837.6s)]
*  the industry benchmarks, the metrics that are typically used by either big pharma or the VC [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=843.6s)]
*  funds that are looking to invest into early stage biotech companies and we can help them with [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=849.84s)]
*  valuing the assets that they have at the early stage. So that's on the BD side. On the market [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=855.52s)]
*  access that is for more mature products. This is not always for the early stage companies. Sometimes, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=861.12s)]
*  yes, but quite often it's for companies that already have the product on the market. They're [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=866.72s)]
*  looking to understand how could their product be reimbursed in a certain geography. We have the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=871.84s)]
*  experience with Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Ukraine where we more or less understand the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  process and can be helpful in that. And tech transfer. Yeah, so this is specifically tailored [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=883.36s)]
*  for companies which are being formed basically at university. So there is this whole issue of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=890.08s)]
*  transferring the IP which is being produced at the university or at the institution and how do you [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=897.36s)]
*  negotiate the future ownership of the company that is being home to this IP. So those are typically [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=903.76s)]
*  the three types of services that we offer to the companies. And as you pointed out, it is true, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=911.2s)]
*  most of them are actually early stage. Are there variations between countries and between [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=916.08s)]
*  universities even when it comes to things like tech transfer? Absolutely. So as an example, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=923.2800000000001s)]
*  Sweden is the only country in the EU where researchers, they own the IP that they've [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=929.2s)]
*  invented. So even though they work at a publicly funded university or institution, if they develop [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=934.32s)]
*  an IP, they're basically an owner of intellectual property. It's not a university or the department [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=940.0s)]
*  at the university. And therefore, it's much easier for them to start something up with the IP. And [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=945.7600000000001s)]
*  this whole process of negotiating the ownership of the future company is not as complex as in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=952.32s)]
*  many other countries. In most of the other countries, it is the case that the IP is typically owned [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=958.48s)]
*  by the institution. And if a new company is being formed, then you need to negotiate on behalf of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=963.84s)]
*  the company with the institution, how is the transfer of the IP, the tech transfer of the IP, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=971.76s)]
*  of the patents from the institution to the company going to look like? And what are the future rights? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=977.6s)]
*  And this is very complicated because typically, VCs or the investors, early stage investors, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=983.76s)]
*  they would expect that the IP is completely owned by the company, by the newly formed company. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=989.52s)]
*  But in some cases, the institutions would much rather just license the IP, keep it in house and [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=994.88s)]
*  license it out. But then it hinders getting future investments. So there are major differences even [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1000.72s)]
*  within the EU between how complex and how lengthy the process is. Could you tell me what the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1006.48s)]
*  difference is between early stage and late stage biotech valuations? Sure. So inherently, developing [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1013.36s)]
*  a drug or in most cases, even a biotech platform is very risky. It's a very risky venture. That's [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  why it's also quite heavy on upfront investments. You need a lot of money to even start up the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1029.36s)]
*  venture. And there's still a lot of risk involved that it's going to amount to nothing. And on [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1034.56s)]
*  average, I think it's been over the past decade, about 7.8% of the drugs that entered clinical [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1040.8s)]
*  developments made it to the market, which is not a large percentage. And we're already talking [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1047.6799999999998s)]
*  drugs that made it to the clinical stage, which is not all of them. So it's very risky. And that's [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1053.76s)]
*  why the early stage biotech valuations are typically based on the potential of a pipeline [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1060.08s)]
*  or potential of an asset or potential drug and need to account in many different ways for the risk [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
*  that is present in this development. Yeah. So various things that could go wrong, ideally, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1071.92s)]
*  should all be accounted for. And that's how you ultimately could end up with the current value. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1077.6s)]
*  With the late stage biotech valuation, meaning close to commercial or commercial, let's say you [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1082.8s)]
*  mitigated the risk because you're already late stage here. So the risk is still there from various [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1087.12s)]
*  angles, but it's nowhere near as high as in the beginning. And that's why you can project much [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1091.9199999999998s)]
*  better the future cash flows, the revenues of the drug in the years to come, so to speak. So they are [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1097.76s)]
*  much more focused on the actual projected cash flows in the late stage. So that's the main [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  difference. Early stage potential, late stage revenues. And what are the different valuation [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1110.32s)]
*  methods that are used? For early stage companies, I would say the most common valuation methods [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1117.52s)]
*  include on one hand, which is also standard for the late stage is the DCF, which is called [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1125.36s)]
*  discounted cash flow. It takes into account the concept of time value of money. So that means that [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1133.6s)]
*  time value of money means that we assume that the money now is worth more than money in the future [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1139.04s)]
*  due to inflation, due to opportunity costs with the money. And it's a valuation method, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1145.68s)]
*  which is really heavily focusing on the cash flows, on projecting the future cash flows, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1151.92s)]
*  discounting them back to the present moment using one discount rate to account for all of the risk, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1157.76s)]
*  which could be then, of course, quite high in the beginning. And the last step of DCF could be so [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1164.96s)]
*  called NPV calculation, which is the net present value calculation. And it is like the last step of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1171.1200000000001s)]
*  DCF, as I said, and mostly it is used to take into account not just the cash flows, but also the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1178.8s)]
*  expenses. And ultimately, you know, ask yourself the question, is the project worth it? So you've, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, the cash flows, it is counted into the present moment. And you also look at expenses. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1190.88s)]
*  And then if you get the negative NPV, yeah, then you know that, okay, well, probably the project [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1196.72s)]
*  is not worth it. And then we come to the most common method used by the big pharma, which is [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1201.68s)]
*  the RMPV. Yes, this is just like the NPV, or you're asking the same question. But here you adjust for [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1207.6000000000001s)]
*  the risk of the development. So you make the risk more granular. So you use one discount rate for [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1214.24s)]
*  the whole valuation, but you account for the different types of risk by looking at the specific [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1222.96s)]
*  risk of failure of the drug in each of the stages. So the risk of not making it from the pre-clinic [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1229.28s)]
*  to phase one, from phase one to phase two, from phase two to phase three, and then through the FDA [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1235.52s)]
*  or email approval, you can look at one drug for different indications, you can have one asset for [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1241.68s)]
*  three different indications, you can do this calculation, this RMPV valuation for each of [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1248.96s)]
*  these three indications. So that would be the third method, or second, depending on how we look at it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1253.76s)]
*  And the other common method used by the VCs, and also some of the early stage companies is so called [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  VC method and comparables method, which is kind of a relative valuation method where you're comparing [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1266.08s)]
*  the company to existing public companies based on the financial metrics, or you're comparing the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1272.56s)]
*  company to some kind of a benchmark deal that has happened in the past, and you're trying to look at [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1278.08s)]
*  either the exit value with the VC method or with the comparables, you're trying to look at what would [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  be the ratio of different financial metrics that you could apply to come up with the valuation for [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  your own company. It's different from the first two or from VC and RMPV because it's relative, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1293.92s)]
*  it's not intrinsic, it's not coming from the inherent value of the asset, but you're trying to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1299.44s)]
*  estimate the value of the asset or of the company. You mentioned that low percentage, 7.8%. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1304.24s)]
*  Why do early stage biotech valuations offer higher upside potential for investors then? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1312.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. That is the reason as you increase the likelihood that you're going to be approved. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1318.8s)]
*  And of course, there are differences in different indications as well or different disease areas. So [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1324.32s)]
*  for example, urology has been notoriously difficult. So the approval rate is even lower [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1329.76s)]
*  than 7% in urology. And on the other hand, the hematology has been, I don't want to say easy, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1335.52s)]
*  but it's been easier to get the drugs through. So as you progress through the phases of drug [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1340.0s)]
*  development, you mitigate the risk or you eat away the risk and you increase the value of the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1346.24s)]
*  asset inherently. And this is also the basis of the RMPV valuation as such. In short, the early [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1351.52s)]
*  stage biotech valuation is often higher upside because you jump through the different clinical [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1358.48s)]
*  and regulatory milestones that make it more likely for your drug to get to the market and be [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1364.56s)]
*  commercial success. Every company is different in terms of the assets that they have. So how do you [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1371.6s)]
*  measure the value of pipeline potential? That's how the big guys value their own portfolios [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1378.48s)]
*  is you would do a valuation of each of the assets for each of the indications. So the value of the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1384.8s)]
*  pipeline potential would be the sum of the RMPVs or different valuation metrics, and most commonly [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1391.36s)]
*  RMPVs for each of the assets that the company has for each of the indications that these assets [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  are supposed to be developed in. So there would be, let's say the technical way, of course, there can be [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1405.6s)]
*  other influences that can increase or decrease the value of the pipeline potential, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1411.52s)]
*  but ideally they should all be modeled in the RMPV as such. Does a bigger pipeline [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1416.8s)]
*  guarantee more success or does it depend on what the pipeline is? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1423.76s)]
*  It very much, as you say, depends on what the pipeline is. So not necessarily. A larger pipeline [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  may suggest eventually a broader opportunity, but if you have a company which is laser focused on a [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1433.36s)]
*  single asset, let's say on a single indication on a single asset, it doesn't mean that it's not a [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1439.92s)]
*  qualitatively good pipeline. It's a smaller pipeline, but you could have a broader pipeline [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1445.52s)]
*  with worse data. You could have five assets which have worse chance. They can all be in pre-clinic, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1450.88s)]
*  the worst chance of getting to the clinic. They may not have such a good in vivo data, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  or you can have one single asset in phase two. What is the better pipeline? And so the breadth [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1463.2800000000002s)]
*  of the pipeline guarantees just potential opportunity, but doesn't guarantee more success. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1469.0400000000002s)]
*  Are there any adjustments or changes that companies can make to look more attractive to investors? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1475.1200000000001s)]
*  So of course, there are some steps that a company can take. For early stage companies, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1482.24s)]
*  still beyond the pipeline, beyond the internal asset, which is still quite important, the team [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1487.28s)]
*  is still majorly important to both investors and to potential partnership partners. So the quality [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1492.48s)]
*  of the team is one of the most important aspects, even if your asset is already on its way, so to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1497.52s)]
*  speak. The patents typically last for about 10 years. You can get some extension in different [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1503.68s)]
*  countries that range from one to five years mostly, but there needs to be some kind of a plan of [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  how are you going to monetize the assets within the scope that the patent allows you. Because [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1516.96s)]
*  you start a development at the beginning of unsupplied patent, it takes 12 to 15 years on [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1523.52s)]
*  average to develop the drug from start to finish. So you're then left with mostly with, you know, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1529.84s)]
*  eight, seven, sometimes five years to monetize the asset. So it's majorly important that you think [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1534.8799999999999s)]
*  about, okay, can you prolong the IP in one way or the other? Could you get the extension [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1540.24s)]
*  in this geographical region or the other? Yeah, so it's really quite crucial for the success of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1546.24s)]
*  the asset as such. It's also the, let's say, plan B or plan C for the assets themselves. So if there [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  is a way of repurposing potentially the drug, if you get a good toxicity data, but let's say not so [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  good efficacy data in your indication in phase one, is there any way you could repurpose for a [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1565.92s)]
*  different indication? Or what would you do in case that something like this happens? If you can show [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1571.2s)]
*  this to your potential partners and to the investors, I think it shows you take it seriously. If you can [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1576.32s)]
*  come up with a plan B or even plan C, I think it's hallmark of a well-determined thing. Yeah. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1581.76s)]
*  And this also comes to my last point, which is the clear commitment to the company. Yeah. So it's [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1586.96s)]
*  quite often you see in many European countries, and this is my experience, that biotech companies [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1590.96s)]
*  are developed by people who still work at universities. So they're like sitting on two [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1596.8s)]
*  tables. I still want to be a professor, but I also want to develop a biotech company, which is, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1600.88s)]
*  I mean, it's fine. But of course, from the point of investors, they want to see a clear commitment [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1607.2s)]
*  of the team to the company and to developing it. So I think those are, let's say, I don't want to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1613.52s)]
*  say easy, but clear adjustments that the companies could make to make themselves more attractive, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1619.28s)]
*  even if they already have a promising asset. We've heard about AI potentially speeding up [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  the pipeline. Does the speed at which potential drugs move through a pipeline affect investment? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1631.44s)]
*  It's a great point. And so AI has been, at least that's my perspective, has become a buzzword, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1638.48s)]
*  well, some time ago, but it's become a real buzzword, maybe a couple of years, maybe three, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  four years ago, with the advent of ChetGPTN. So AI has been used in different ways in drug discovery [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1649.04s)]
*  for longer now, and it's coming into play already through companies like Exientia. And Exientia is [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1655.6000000000001s)]
*  basically utilizing AI to model in silico. So on the computer, basically, different interactions [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1662.96s)]
*  of potential molecule, or just come up with leads for molecules much quicker than you would normally [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1670.32s)]
*  be able to do, yeah, with the high-proofed screening, which is normally used. So it's playing [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1676.08s)]
*  increasingly valuable role because it can shorten the whole drug discovery process rapidly. What you [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1681.04s)]
*  see on computer can be then confirmed in your actual experiments, and you see the different [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1686.48s)]
*  kinetic data on the molecule. So you see it really works, then you just save yourself and the company [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1692.56s)]
*  a lot of time. So certainly, because any time that you can save at the beginning is the time that you [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1699.44s)]
*  have free at the end of the development. So that's crucial. It's going to be increasingly important [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1705.28s)]
*  also for various IP or patent database searches and data crunching. So it's only get increasingly [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1710.3999999999999s)]
*  important and it's already quite important. Earlier, you were mentioning the different [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1718.64s)]
*  valuation methods. Which of those methods is better for biotech companies? The main difference [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1724.16s)]
*  between NPV and RMPV as an estimate is that with NPV, the discount rate, meaning the percentage that [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  you use to account for the risk of development is very high at the very beginning, and it's rather [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1738.5600000000002s)]
*  inaccurate. So it's like you come for all the risk, including the cost of capital of the company [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1745.28s)]
*  under one, let's say, percentage that you use, and you come up with a valuation based on that. So this [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1751.84s)]
*  is basically the extension of the DCF. And with RMPV, and this is what I also mentioned previously, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1757.2s)]
*  this is mostly the benchmark for all the big pharma companies, all the big pharma BD guys that [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1763.68s)]
*  you're going to be interacting with as a small biotech. RMPV is basically the same, but very [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1770.3999999999999s)]
*  different in the sense that it accounts for the risk externally or in a way that is much more [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  accurate. So you can get a different data on what is the likelihood that your molecule is going to [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1782.8s)]
*  pass for the different phases of development. And you can model your assumptions based on this. So [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1789.28s)]
*  this is why it's called RMPV. It's a shortcut for risk adjusted NPV. It's a small biotech. If you're [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1795.04s)]
*  going to come up with your own valuation, your partners, future partners, and your investors, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1801.12s)]
*  they're going to come up with their own, that's for sure. And it may not always be the one that [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1805.92s)]
*  you would have liked. It's more than advisable to come up with the valuation on your own. And then [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1809.68s)]
*  you can, if it's well defensible, which RMPV is made to be well defensible valuation, then you have [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1814.96s)]
*  also much better negotiating ground for your future partnership or for your investment route. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1821.04s)]
*  Are there certain areas of biotech that are doing better than others in terms of valuation? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1827.76s)]
*  Yes. And it's ultimately driven by the commercial environment for those drugs or for those areas of [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1833.76s)]
*  biotech. So areas like oncology, rare diseases, and especially gene therapies, so ATMP, so-called [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1839.52s)]
*  advanced medicinal therapeutic products, do better because the reimbursement environment is [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1847.6s)]
*  more allowing of these drugs as well. And also, by the way, the funding scheme, so there's a lot [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1854.24s)]
*  more grants, non-dilutive funding you can get for the development of oncology drugs than for [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  the development of new antibiotics at this point. So they do better. And it's mostly based on the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1865.6s)]
*  commercial potential success that they could have based on the reimbursement environment in [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1872.64s)]
*  different countries and also the subsidies for R&D, which are not available for other areas of [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1877.6s)]
*  biotech. So oncology is now a very hot topic. You have many different, also cell therapies, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1884.8s)]
*  you have so-called ADCs, antibiotic drug conjugates, you have immunotherapy, so the [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1889.76s)]
*  checkpoint inhibitors still coming up. It's been a really hot area over the past 10 years. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1894.08s)]
*  Also, the rare diseases are quite favored when it comes to the reimbursement as such. So certainly [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1898.96s)]
*  there are differences. Are there things that affect valuation, like location and previous [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1904.64s)]
*  history and the people that are involved with the company? Yeah, absolutely. So as I also mentioned [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1910.56s)]
*  previously, the team is crucial for the valuation. You can have a great asset, but if the team doesn't [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1916.16s)]
*  make the cut for whatever reason, it could not be just the quality, it could be the chemistry in the [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1921.92s)]
*  team. And a good investor or well-seasoned partnership partner or company which would [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1925.76s)]
*  engage in a partnership with you would certainly also have a special, not only how big is the team, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1933.44s)]
*  but what are the backgrounds? Can the people work together? So the staff is majorly important. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1938.32s)]
*  Company location, unfortunately, is unfair, but it's so that companies in certain areas like [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1943.2s)]
*  in Boston, in some of the biotech hubs in Europe, they typically can get some premium on the [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1949.52s)]
*  valuation based on the location that's been shown. And also the previous history is majorly important. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  So if the people in the company have had previous history or even the company has had previous [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1962.3999999999999s)]
*  history of some successful launches in whatever area, or if people have had experiences of getting [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1967.04s)]
*  the company to an exit or to a successful trade sale deal to an IPO, of course then you can expect [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1972.88s)]
*  some kind of a premium on the valuation based on that. So that's also what I try to emphasize to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1980.24s)]
*  our clients that if you do an RMPV valuation for them, the valuation of the company could be [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  different based on other factors, just the cash in the bank, but also the non-bank job ones, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1990.5600000000002s)]
*  like I just mentioned. When it comes to patients, is there a difference in terms of investment and [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=1996.48s)]
*  also for the companies themselves between companies looking to create an expensive drug for rare [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2003.84s)]
*  diseases and companies that might be targeting cheaper drugs? Is VC kind of shying away from [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2010.16s)]
*  expensive drugs or shying away from cheap drugs? There is a discrepancy in between different [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2017.52s)]
*  biotech areas and it's of course the case that the biotech VCs which are taking even more risk [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2023.6s)]
*  than is usual for a VC to take on, they are looking for big returns. So they of course would [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2030.32s)]
*  be more interested in indications where the returns are more significant or the potential [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2036.56s)]
*  returns is more significant. And because of this there has been a problem for decades now with [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2041.4399999999998s)]
*  antibiotic resistance. So it's been very long since new classes of antibiotics have been [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2048.4s)]
*  developed and we get more and more resistance to various types of antibiotics that we use now. So [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2054.88s)]
*  we have big problems with MRSA which is a hospital acquired infection, it's so-called medicine [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2061.12s)]
*  resistant sub-oreas. More and more bacteria are becoming resistant to various types of antibiotics [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2066.88s)]
*  that we have and up until very recently it's been almost completely ignored. It's very good [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2073.6s)]
*  we're developing drugs for these also needed indications but we may have a big problem on our [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2079.2s)]
*  hands in a decade or two if we do not do something. So I think there are some schemes now to support [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  for example companies developing new classes of antibiotics or even repurposing all drugs as new [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2090.7999999999997s)]
*  class of antibiotics. I've also seen projects like this but of course the VCs and investors [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2096.56s)]
*  would mostly prefer the companies that are developing drugs where the returns are [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2102.4s)]
*  guaranteed to be higher at least in theory. So this is of course a societal problem. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2107.12s)]
*  We often hear about funding being a major issue. Is it hard to come by now than it was in the past [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2113.44s)]
*  and is that likely to change in the future do you think? Yeah that's also a very good question [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2119.76s)]
*  because 2021 has been almost named by biotech insiders to be this kind of a goldmine year for [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2124.64s)]
*  biotech funding. So lots of things converge together favorable lending environments, Covid [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2132.64s)]
*  which made biotech basically a worldwide topic and 2021 became the best year ever for biotech investment [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2139.12s)]
*  biotech funding. And it's led to a small I would say bubble so there are some companies that went [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2147.44s)]
*  public under valuations which were weight overshoot which probably shouldn't have gone [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2152.24s)]
*  public at all in the first place. So depends on what kind of time frame we are looking at. So [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2157.2799999999997s)]
*  compared to maybe 20 years ago it's probably still easier to get funding for a biotech company now [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2162.3199999999997s)]
*  just because there are more companies more and more funds that are you know aware of the field [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2168.24s)]
*  are focusing on the field. There are more funds coming up in Europe which wasn't the case before. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2172.3199999999997s)]
*  There are very few VCs in Europe that are focusing on biotech as such. So compared to 2021 it's [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2177.36s)]
*  probably harder to get funding right now but generally speaking the situation is definitely [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2184.0s)]
*  improving for small companies and it's also quite often the case that once the company is successful [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  it goes public yeah that the people get rich so to speak and they become business angels with [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2196.96s)]
*  experience yeah so experienced business angels that are able to properly stage biotech companies [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2202.56s)]
*  you know in their local ecosystem. So it's definitely improving overall but 2021 was the golden year. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2209.44s)]
*  A really comprehensive and useful look at the financial side of biotech there [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  and also a bit about the scene in Eastern Europe so a great overview from Adam there. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQxV9GogKoQ&t=2227.92s)]
