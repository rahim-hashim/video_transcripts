*  This week on the podcast we're talking about the next generation of gene therapy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=73.18s)]
*  Now gene therapy is often in the news, but are we on the cusp of the industry moving [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=79.18s)]
*  to a new generation of treatments? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=84.38s)]
*  And what about the challenges and barriers to bringing new gene therapies to market, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=87.24s)]
*  particularly as they expand into more prevalent diseases? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=93.08s)]
*  To help answer these questions, this week our guest on the podcast is Michael Perini, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=98.32s)]
*  CEO of Spur Therapeutics, a US company dedicated to developing next generation gene therapies [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  for people living with chronic debilitating diseases. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=112.16s)]
*  So I wonder if first you could tell me then a little bit about the history of the company. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so Spur Therapeutics, we founded the company actually just this year and it really [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=122.36s)]
*  was a result of a lot of hard work and progress at Freeline Therapeutics, which was our predecessor [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  company. And then we had an opportunity to acquire another company, Swann Bio. And when [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=133.72s)]
*  we put the two together, we felt like it was a good opportunity to take a step back and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  think about who we are and what we're trying to accomplish. I think Spur signifies our [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=144.2s)]
*  ambition to take gene therapy to sort of the next frontier of diseases, which for us is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=149.56s)]
*  more prevalent diseases where you have an opportunity to impact even more patients' [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  lives. And so we want to sort of spur the field of gene therapy forward. So we announced that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=159.64s)]
*  name change earlier this year. It's been really well received by our employees. Certainly our [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=165.0s)]
*  investors are supportive of it as well. So it's been exciting. It's been a lot of fun so far. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=170.36s)]
*  We have two clinical stage programs. We have one for Gaucher disease, one for Adrenomyelone [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  neuropathy, which is a rare neurodegenerative disease without a treatment today. We follow [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=180.36s)]
*  that with a really exciting pipeline of bold programs, including one in Parkinson's disease, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  which sort of builds on the work we've done in Gaucher. And then we have another project [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=191.56s)]
*  that's a little bit earlier in research going after a very severe form of congestive heart [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=196.6s)]
*  failure. And our approach is really to optimize each and every component of our product candidates [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  to make sure that we're getting to the right cells with the right levels of expression, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  the right uptake in those cells in a way that doesn't just provide a therapeutic benefit, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=212.92s)]
*  but provides a transformative one over and above what the standard of care is today. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  We're making great progress on that front. We're moving into phase three with our [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=223.56s)]
*  Gaucher program next year, and then quickly following it with readouts for AMN and moving [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=227.32s)]
*  into the clinic with Parkinson's disease. So super exciting time to be at the company. And [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=234.04s)]
*  we're excited about the progress we've made. Gene therapy seems to be always in the news and no [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=239.08s)]
*  less so this year. I wonder if you could kind of give us a bit of a snapshot as to where the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  gene therapy field is at right now. Yeah, I think, you know, gene therapy, I think from our [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=250.2s)]
*  perspective is really at an inflection point. It's a technology that's been around for a while. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=255.16s)]
*  And like any disruptive technology, it sort of goes through waves and phases of development. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=259.96s)]
*  And I think, you know, early days with gene therapy, there was a lot of learning, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=266.44s)]
*  trial and error, and a lot of learning about what is the best way to deploy this new technology [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=269.56s)]
*  to ultimately develop therapeutics that have value to patients and health care systems. And so [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=275.24s)]
*  we've seen that first wave of innovation give way to a set of products and programs that are either [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=281.72s)]
*  in the clinic or even approved at this point. And I think what we've learned from that is they sort [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=288.2s)]
*  of fit into two categories, Jim. The first was, you know, there's an exciting technology. It is, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=293.0s)]
*  you know, gene transfer. You put a healthy normal gene in a person and they get to produce [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=299.64s)]
*  some protein that they were missing. And that's exciting. But I think what the first group of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=305.64s)]
*  products tried to do is basically take advantage of the technology. That was the innovation. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=310.76s)]
*  We could have constant expression of the therapeutic protein. And I think in a lot of those [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=316.6s)]
*  instances, the product profiles that emerged were, you know, more convenient, but the efficacy was [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=320.92s)]
*  around the same as existing treatments. And in some of those diseases like hemophilia A, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=327.56s)]
*  existing treatments were quite good. So you had the innovation in the technology, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=333.72s)]
*  but you didn't necessarily have those therapeutic outcomes that were better. And I think that's been [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=338.84s)]
*  a harder set of products to advance and have success with. I think another set of products [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=343.8s)]
*  from that sort of first wave of innovation really provided, they leveraged the technology to provide [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=349.72s)]
*  a solution where there was no treatment available, you know, very severe diseases where they've had [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=355.88s)]
*  a meaningful impact in those patients' lives. And those products have done quite well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=361.96s)]
*  So I think at Spur, we sort of looked at the field and said, all right, I think us, like a few others, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=366.36s)]
*  have said, there's a room to take this set of diseases, really be focused on where you go, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=372.52s)]
*  really be focused on how you deploy the technology, to really leverage the modality, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=378.6s)]
*  but continue to think about what makes a new medicine impactful. And that's really just being [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=383.56s)]
*  better than the medicines that exist today. You know, the gene therapy doesn't get a pass on that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=389.0s)]
*  requirement. You need to show a better clinical outcome. And that's really been our focus. And I [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=393.48s)]
*  think, you know, we have a somewhat unique approach to doing that. And I think we feel like 201, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=399.08s)]
*  our FLT-201 has really been a nice opportunity to demonstrate that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=403.88s)]
*  You mentioned what's gone before. What are some of the challenges that are still existing for gene [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=409.24s)]
*  therapies? And how can some of those maybe be solved? Yeah, I think, you know, the field has [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=415.16s)]
*  learned a lot. There's no question about it. I look at sort of, I'll use us as an example, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=421.72s)]
*  I look at our portfolio, and we used to have products where gene therapy was focused on [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  essentially making the product more convenient for patients. And those were some of our older [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=434.12s)]
*  programs. And we took a step back a few years ago and said, is that really where gene therapy [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=438.84s)]
*  should be playing? Because what you see in those programs is, you know, a lot of upfront investment, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=444.84s)]
*  very, very costly clinical development and manufacturing to produce something that kind of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=450.44s)]
*  works in a similar way to what's out there today. And so when we set out Otspur, we said, all right, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=455.08s)]
*  how do we figure out what we want to do to be differentiated? And, you know, I'll use a couple [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=461.08s)]
*  products as an example for how we think the field is moving. FLT-201 is our lead program in Gaucher [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  disease. When we set out to do that project, we sort of took, in the beginning, I would say, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=473.24s)]
*  a first generation gene therapy approach. We used a capsid that we had, which was proprietary, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=478.84s)]
*  but really tried to use sort of an off the shelf wild type transgene, sort of the DNA sequencing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=485.4s)]
*  that encodes to the protein. And what we saw was we could probably do the same as enzyme [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  replacement therapy, but that wasn't good enough for us. And so we kind of went back to the drawing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  board and said, we want to do better. And I think that's the hallmark of sort of the next wave of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=502.67999999999995s)]
*  innovation is having clinical outcomes that are better than what exists today. And so we did some [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=507.32s)]
*  protein engineering, really tailored the transgene to produce, you know, a variant of GK, it's called [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=513.08s)]
*  GK-85, that has incredible properties over the wild type. It's much more stable. It lasts longer [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=519.08s)]
*  in the blood. It lasts longer in cells, which are really the problems with enzyme replacement [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=526.6s)]
*  therapy. It's a very short half-life. Patients get it and it doesn't get to all the cells that it needs [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=531.24s)]
*  to, including bone in particular, which is an area of unmet need for Gaucher patients. And so when we [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=536.9200000000001s)]
*  develop GK-85, we're seeing it stay in the blood longer. We're seeing it reach those cells. We're [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=542.44s)]
*  seeing it stay in the cells longer and it's reducing the harmful substrate and really changing the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=547.32s)]
*  course of the disease for these patients. And so when I think about gene therapy and sort of how [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  it moves forward to the next wave, it really is about optimizing each and every component of the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=557.08s)]
*  product. It's not off the shelf capsid and off the shelf transgene. It's got to be a capsid that's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=563.1600000000001s)]
*  really designed to address the cells that need to be transduced and expression and uptake in all [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=569.32s)]
*  the cells that need to be treated. It's got to be a transgene that produces a therapeutic protein [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  that adds value above and beyond what exists today. And of course it needs to do it in a way [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=581.24s)]
*  that's safe. You also need in gene therapy to really check a couple other boxes. You need a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=586.84s)]
*  durable treatment. I think that's an area where, again, if you're going to give a one-time treatment, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=592.44s)]
*  it's got to last. We see that's an area that we've spent a lot of time focused on. We have a capsid [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=597.48s)]
*  that really has a track record from prior programs of having really nice durability out past five [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=603.48s)]
*  years. That's something I think patients and healthcare systems are going to expect. And you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=609.24s)]
*  also need something that honestly you could scale and make safely and produce and make it accessible [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=615.0s)]
*  to patients. And so our treatment today is a one-hour infusion. That's quite different than some of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=620.52s)]
*  the other genetic approaches out there where patients need to undergo chemotherapy and have [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=626.36s)]
*  their cells mobilized and a much more disruptive intervention in terms of a therapeutic approach. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=631.4s)]
*  So we really see a nice opportunity here, but you got to approach it the right way. And I think [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=637.4s)]
*  we're focused on doing that. Now that gene therapy has been well established, we hear about [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=641.96s)]
*  next generation gene therapy. I wonder how you would characterize what that means? Yeah, I think [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=647.64s)]
*  early on, I think that there was a tremendous appetite to have a platform approach, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=655.0s)]
*  Where you have a platform that you just sort of plug and play different trans genes into, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=660.84s)]
*  and you can go after one disease today with this platform and another disease tomorrow with the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=665.4s)]
*  same platform. I think that's sort of a first generation approach. I understand why that was [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=670.04s)]
*  the field and that's what we all tried to do early on. But I think we think you really need to evolve [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=676.12s)]
*  your thinking and make each and every product precisely tailored to what you're trying to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=682.2s)]
*  accomplish. And when I look at Parkinson's disease, it's a great example for us. We have GKC85, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=687.64s)]
*  which is this enhanced enzyme that really is showing a difference in Gaucher. And I think [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=693.8s)]
*  it's having a huge impact. There are a subset of Parkinson's disease patients who have the same [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=698.92s)]
*  mutation as Gaucher patients, a mutation in the GBA1 gene that causes them to not have an enzyme [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=703.88s)]
*  that's needed to clear out substrate in cells and maintain cellular health. We took the GKC85 [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=709.96s)]
*  and said, how do we leverage it in this Parkinson's disease program? But we didn't just take it, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=717.24s)]
*  put it in a capsid and stick it into the CNS setting. We stopped. We spent, frankly, over a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=722.12s)]
*  year now optimizing the construct to make sure that it is engaging the right cells in a CNS [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=727.64s)]
*  setting. The cells are different than what we're addressing in Gaucher, which was a liver directed [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  treatment, making sure that it's having the right levels of expression. We're getting cellular [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=738.44s)]
*  uptake in the right parts of the brain at the right levels. And we're doing it in a way that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=743.08s)]
*  causes the least amount of cellular distress because you are introducing a virus and a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  therapeutic to cells. It does cause a cellular stress. And so we've really focused on optimizing [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  that efficacy safety balance. Now what we're doing is we're looking at, well, what's the best way to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=760.36s)]
*  get it to the CNS setting? It's a different setting than liver. And so again, I think this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=765.64s)]
*  wave of innovation is going to really require incredible thoughtfulness at each step of putting [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=772.36s)]
*  together your program candidates. And that's exactly what we're doing. And we're seeing really [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=778.04s)]
*  nice success in Gaucher with that approach. So we're taking that forward. And I think it is sort of [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=782.92s)]
*  the next wave of innovation is not using a one size fits all, but really specifically optimizing [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=787.8s)]
*  each and every product you have for the disease that you're trying to treat in the setting that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=795.24s)]
*  you're trying to treat it. I think while in some respects, it's a little bit unfair to mention [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=799.72s)]
*  money. One of the knocks against gene therapies has often been the cost. Do you see that that can be [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  reduced and this can be something that could be extended to more people globally? Yeah, it's [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=813.5600000000001s)]
*  certainly top of mind for us and all innovative life sciences companies and making medicines that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=820.28s)]
*  people can't get doesn't really help the world. And I think that's something we all appreciate. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=826.04s)]
*  It doesn't help us either, because we are trying to create something that is sustainable in terms [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=830.12s)]
*  of continued investment in the future. I think that there are different kinds of diseases for [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=835.24s)]
*  rare diseases. You know, right now you look at Gaucher is a perfect example. Gaucher patients [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=839.88s)]
*  in most of the Western world have pretty good access to enzyme replacement therapy, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=845.88s)]
*  but it's quite expensive, right? It's three to $500,000 a year for the rest of their life [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=850.12s)]
*  to take their ERT. And so when you sort of think about the Gaucher patient journey and the impact [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=857.16s)]
*  on them and the healthcare system, they're diagnosed, you know, usually late teens, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=863.16s)]
*  early twenties, and then they go on therapy for decades at three to $500,000 a year. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=868.12s)]
*  So when we talk to payers, a one-time treatment that's durable, that has not just the same [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=874.76s)]
*  efficacy, but better efficacy and a clean safety profile, we've had really positive response, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=880.84s)]
*  certainly from payers that see the bigger picture. And I think that's a case where we can actually [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=886.92s)]
*  receive a fair price, but also create a lot of value and value savings for the healthcare system. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=892.12s)]
*  As we and others start moving into bigger diseases, where there are more patients and we're [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=897.88s)]
*  outside of the rare setting, I do think we need to start focused on some efficiencies. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=903.48s)]
*  And I think that's where you need to get the cost of development down. And there are a couple of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=908.2s)]
*  ways to do that, Jim. The first is manufacturing. When Spur slash Freeline started back in 2015, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=912.6800000000001s)]
*  the cost of manufacturing was quite high. It was sort of a new technology. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=920.84s)]
*  Manufacturing is expensive. This is not small molecule manufacturing. These are complex [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=925.96s)]
*  organisms that you need to put into a very specific setting to make them with high, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=931.48s)]
*  high parameters around quality and control. And so what we see is, how do we build scale [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=936.6800000000001s)]
*  in areas where you don't need differentiation, manufacturing, to drive those costs down? And [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=943.8000000000001s)]
*  we've seen it in our projects where the costs of making a dose of our treatment have gone down [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=949.48s)]
*  considerably just since 2015. And so I think that's an area that's really ripe for continued [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=954.36s)]
*  innovation, continued efficiency, and building scale at a broader level for gene therapy. And [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=960.04s)]
*  that's happening. And that's encouraging me. The other piece of this, of course, is how do you [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=966.04s)]
*  design your intervention to be as cost effective as possible? And I think we're starting to really [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=971.64s)]
*  see that opportunity in some of our projects. Like, we have a congestive heart failure project [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=977.4s)]
*  where we know this is not a rare disease. The patient population is 10 to 20,000 patients a year, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=983.32s)]
*  a year suffer from this condition. If we're going to deploy a gene therapy, we need to do it in a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=991.48s)]
*  smart way where we can really do it efficiently and secure the right kind of cost profile. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=997.32s)]
*  That's not going to be some of these multimillion dollar price tags that you see on some of the rare [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1003.96s)]
*  disease conditions where there's only a certain number of patients that you can treat as a company. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1009.64s)]
*  So I think that's an area where, again, innovation with how you approach the disease, how you [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1014.12s)]
*  administer it, how much product you need, and you can enhance all those things by doing what we're [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1019.08s)]
*  doing, which is really targeting the therapeutic, getting more out of each component in a synergistic [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1023.96s)]
*  way. So you have lower doses and you can really drive a better cost profile for your product. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1030.52s)]
*  I'd say the last thing is the regulatory environment. We're seeing certainly across [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1037.4s)]
*  our discussions with regulators, a real appetite to use biomarkers and other early indicators [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1043.0800000000002s)]
*  because it does speed up development in an appropriate way. If you have a really clear [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1051.0s)]
*  biomarker that says, if this is being improved, it will translate into benefits, that helps companies [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1055.16s)]
*  like us do things more efficiently in the front end because clinical trials are very expensive, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1062.44s)]
*  as you know. So the more we can do efficiently in terms of manufacturing, in terms of dose and [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1068.04s)]
*  using the innovation that we've created to be more efficient with the product we're producing, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1075.0s)]
*  and then a cleaner and clearer regulatory path, I think it'll make a difference and it'll make [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  these treatments just a lot more accessible in the future. Are there other companies working on [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1084.76s)]
*  these next generation gene therapies, not necessarily the same diseases that you're [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1090.2s)]
*  looking at? We're at the start of that process. I mean, we like to think we're kind of in the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  vanguard here and at the forefront of it. I do think for some of the reasons I mentioned in terms [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1101.0s)]
*  of efficiency, a lot of companies use sort of platform approaches to address these things. And [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1106.28s)]
*  I think, again, from my perspective, the goal here has to be a very specific tailored approach [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1112.92s)]
*  to treat the disease you're going after. And I think it would be unreasonable to think an approach [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1120.28s)]
*  that treats a systemic disease like Gaucher is going to be the same approach that works [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1125.96s)]
*  in a CNS setting like Parkinson's. And so you do have to put the work in to really target. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1130.92s)]
*  And I think we're seeing some companies start that process, but I think for us, we hope to be [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1136.28s)]
*  the leaders there and really demonstrate the value of this approach. And I think like other [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1141.4s)]
*  things in the life sciences world, once you start seeing that value and that validation, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1146.3600000000001s)]
*  I think you'll see a bunch of others follow. You already mentioned a little bit about [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1151.16s)]
*  FLT-201 and Gaucher disease. I wonder if you could kind of go into a bit more detail on [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1156.0400000000002s)]
*  Gaucher disease, how it's treated and how you're tackling it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1162.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so our lead program, FLT-201, is for Gaucher disease type 1, which is the most common form of [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1166.68s)]
*  the disease. There's three types. This one is about 95% of patients have type 1. And it's caused by [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  mutations in their genome that don't allow them to make an enzyme, G case, which is critical in [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1178.2s)]
*  your cells to break down fatty lipids that build up through cellular processes. When you don't have [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1185.0s)]
*  this enzyme, these substrates build up in the cells causing cellular dysfunction and death. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1190.6s)]
*  And you end up having a number of symptoms that are quite debilitating. These patients have [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1196.84s)]
*  enlarged organs. These patients have fatigue. They have pain. They have severe bone impairment, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  which leads to fractures and bone pain. They have lung dysfunction. And so you see this effect about [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1208.28s)]
*  18,000 patients. If you look at the US, basically big markets in the EU and Israel. So it's a rare [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1214.6s)]
*  disease, but it affects a lot of people and their families. What they've had to date is treatments [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1222.6799999999998s)]
*  like enzyme replacement therapy, which is sort of the standard of care today. And while it's been [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1228.04s)]
*  effective in some things, it hasn't fully addressed the disease. 60% of patients continue to have [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1232.6799999999998s)]
*  symptoms despite being on enzyme replacement for years. And there are areas that really don't get [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1239.32s)]
*  addressed because enzyme replacement therapy, as I mentioned, has a really short half life. And so [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1244.6s)]
*  when you look at patients that present with Gaucher, even being on treatment for years, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1250.28s)]
*  they still have bone impairment. They still have lung dysfunction. They still have pain and fatigue. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1256.12s)]
*  And I think that's where we see a real opportunity to sort of address some of these [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1261.1599999999999s)]
*  areas of unmet need. Where are you at with clinical trials? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1265.24s)]
*  Yeah. So FLT-201 is in the clinic. It's one of our key clinical programs. It is our lead asset [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1269.96s)]
*  as an organization. And we've made great progress. We are in phase one, two development. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1276.44s)]
*  Unlike small molecules, you don't really have a phase one that stands alone because you are [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1282.44s)]
*  treating patients just given the severity of these diseases and the nature of the treatment, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1287.64s)]
*  which is sort of a one-time treatment. We've treated six patients in our phase one, two. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1291.56s)]
*  We've completed enrollment. We've seen really, really fantastic results in terms of both safety [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1295.72s)]
*  and efficacy. And now we're in discussions with regulators about how do we move this quickly [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1301.32s)]
*  forward into our pivotal trial to get it to patients as fast as possible. And there's a [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1307.08s)]
*  couple of really nice opportunities that the regulators have provided recognizing if you have [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1312.04s)]
*  a treatment that could be a meaningful advance over treatments today, there are pathways both in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1317.96s)]
*  Europe as well as in the US and the UK that allow you to have early and frequent conversations. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1324.6000000000001s)]
*  RMAT, Prime, ILAP are designations that are afforded to treatments that could be true advances for [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1331.32s)]
*  patients above and beyond the standard of care. And so we've secured all of those designations. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1337.72s)]
*  We're having those conversations with regulators and we're going to start our [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1343.16s)]
*  pivotal trial or registrational trial just next year. So we're super excited about that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1346.76s)]
*  Is it a cure or is it maintenance or what's the measure of success, I guess? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1351.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. So pre-clinically, we saw really exciting things and I think that's [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1357.0s)]
*  always sort of the basis of moving into development. Companies always get excited about getting into the [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1361.4s)]
*  clinic because you can really see, hey, has our innovation translated? And so in our program, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1366.68s)]
*  we've treated, as I mentioned, six patients with FLT-201. And they all came in with varying forms [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1372.36s)]
*  of unmet needs. There is a fair amount of heterogeneity as patients present. Every patient [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1379.3999999999999s)]
*  was on treatment for at least two years. So these patients have been treated by enzyme replacement [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1384.36s)]
*  therapy or another therapy called substrate reduction therapy for two years, at least, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  most of the time, much longer than that. And they got some areas, they were pretty well-controlled, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1394.52s)]
*  some areas not so well-controlled. And so what we've seen in our trial is just remarkable. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1399.8799999999999s)]
*  First, we've seen very safe product, which I think is the starting point for any treatment. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1406.36s)]
*  Our infusions, again, enzyme replacement therapy is an infusion every two weeks for about four or [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1411.6399999999999s)]
*  five hours. Ours is a one-hour infusion and then that's it, Jim. The expression I like to use is [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1417.6399999999999s)]
*  sort of an old proverb. You give a man a fish and he eats for a day. You teach a man how to fish [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1424.12s)]
*  and he eats for a lifetime. That's sort of gene therapy. We take a piece of DNA and we train the [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1429.64s)]
*  body how to make the product for themselves, in our case with 201 from the liver. And so what [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1436.2s)]
*  we're seeing now is that approach is working really well. We have all five patients out of the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1442.2s)]
*  efficacy cohort out of five have had really dramatic reductions in a biomarker called LysogB1. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  It measures that harmful substrate that I was talking about that builds up in cells. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1457.16s)]
*  And so these patients came in after years of treatment and we've been able to take all of them [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1462.04s)]
*  down significantly. And I'm talking like 30, 50, 70, 99% reduction in this harmful substrate [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1468.2s)]
*  after being treated with FLT-201, where some of them have normal levels now, which is really [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1475.4s)]
*  exciting. We're seeing a huge impact on bone, which is one of the areas that we knew existing [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1481.64s)]
*  treatments couldn't really address just because of the intrinsic properties of the product. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  And so we've got five out of five patients having significant improvement in bone burden. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1493.4s)]
*  And so you look at the MRIs and you see all these diseased parts of a bone and then, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1499.24s)]
*  you know, just three, four or five months later, you're seeing healthy bone marrow. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1504.8400000000001s)]
*  It's really exciting for us. We also see reductions in pain and fatigue, which is an area of need for [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1509.4s)]
*  some patients. One of the patients in our trial couldn't hold a job, was depressed, really was in [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1517.8s)]
*  quite a bit of pain, had really high pain scores coming in. And now you meet him and he's like a [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1524.68s)]
*  new man. It's remarkable. His full-time job, exercises regularly, pain is down dramatically [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1529.96s)]
*  from where he started. I've been in this industry for a while and I've worked on a lot of projects. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1536.44s)]
*  As much as the data, those are the kinds of stories that tell me, you know, we're really [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1541.48s)]
*  having an impact. And I think if you have an impact, that's going to translate into success [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1545.3200000000002s)]
*  for the product. And so we're super excited about the data that's emerged. You know, we're continuing [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1549.48s)]
*  to follow it. We'll present some more later this fall at a big scientific conference in Rome in [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1554.2s)]
*  October. But we are very much excited about the profile that's emerged and taking it forward into [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1559.3200000000002s)]
*  a larger group of patients next year. Could you tell us a bit about your work on adrenomyeloneuropathy? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1564.92s)]
*  Sure. So, you know, adrenomyeloneuropathy is a severe disease. Again, in a lot of ways, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1570.76s)]
*  similar to some of the treatments that we've talked about to date, it is caused by a mutation, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1576.8400000000001s)]
*  in this case, the ABCD1 gene, which prevents the making of a protein that is critical to breaking [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1582.3600000000001s)]
*  down these very long chain fatty acids that accumulate in this case, spinal cord cells, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1589.96s)]
*  and in that setting. And so what this leads to is a severe neurodegenerative disease where patients [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1597.0s)]
*  experience severe pain, mobility challenges, incontinence. From sort of the emergence of [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1603.72s)]
*  symptoms, usually within about a decade or so, patients are reliant on a wheelchair for mobility. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1610.52s)]
*  There are no treatments today. And so, you know, when we think about an opportunity to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1616.76s)]
*  leverage gene therapy to change patients' lives, this is an exciting one for us. And our approach [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1621.64s)]
*  is similar where we're going to administer our treatment. It's SBT-101 to provide a healthy [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1629.08s)]
*  version of that ABCD1 gene that allows the patient to make the protein it needs to break down those [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1635.64s)]
*  very long chain fatty acids. And preclinically, we've seen that. We've seen that expression of [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1642.76s)]
*  the protein. We've seen the reduction of the very long chain fatty acids in the right cells. And so [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1647.64s)]
*  now we're in the process of continuing to dose patients in our phase one, two. I think we've [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1654.44s)]
*  treated, I think it's six patients to date. We're waiting to see the data. It is a neurodegenerative [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1659.08s)]
*  disease, so it takes a bit more time than, say, Gaucher to see that impact. But the early signs [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1665.0s)]
*  are encouraging. You know, the first patient in the trial, we have seen some really encouraging [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1670.36s)]
*  efficacy data in terms of body sway. And these patients have real balance and mobility issues. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1675.1599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, they take time to develop, but an early marker for us is body sway. And we've seen [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1680.6s)]
*  an improvement already in patient one. So we're excited about that. We're going to read out data [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1685.8s)]
*  from all patients in the first half of next year and then obviously take the program forward, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1691.1599999999999s)]
*  depending on what we see. I guess we've seen quite a few approvals in the gene therapy space. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1696.12s)]
*  Do you anticipate that there's going to be lots more in the near future? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1701.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I do. When I look back over the last, you know, five, six years, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1706.52s)]
*  since the beginning of 2022, I think we've seen 13 approvals in gene therapy, which is, you know, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1711.3999999999999s)]
*  almost three times as many as we saw in the prior three-year period. So I think you'll continue to [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1718.04s)]
*  see that acceleration of gene therapy products getting approved, addressing even more and more [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1723.24s)]
*  diseases. I think right now there are maybe a hundred or so clinical trials evaluating gene [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1729.64s)]
*  therapies in various forms of diseases. And so I think the field has continued to invest, has [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1735.72s)]
*  continued to sort of refine our thinking and move it forward. So I do anticipate over the next, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1742.52s)]
*  you know, handful of years, we're going to see even more approvals. And I think we're going to see [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1748.76s)]
*  some products that have a lot of success if they've sort of met those key parameters that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1753.4s)]
*  I was talking about in terms of truly changing patients' lives. And we might still have some [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1758.28s)]
*  that sort of don't hit the mark, but I think on balance, we're going to see more of the former [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1763.4s)]
*  than the latter. And I think that's sort of how the field is going to move forward. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1768.44s)]
*  How quickly do you see the gene therapy field evolving? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1772.68s)]
*  You know the space well. These things take time. There's no doubt about it. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1777.96s)]
*  I am encouraged by, I think last year there were more gene therapy trials initiated than any year [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1782.2s)]
*  in our experience in history. And gene therapy has been through a fair amount. The way I look [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1788.2800000000002s)]
*  at it is any disruptive technology, there's usually a wave of interest and investment and [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1793.24s)]
*  companies formed early on. And there certainly were in the 2015 to 2020 range. We just saw this [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1800.2800000000002s)]
*  tremendous movement into genetic medicines generally, but gene therapy in particular. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1808.36s)]
*  And then you kind of go through this progression where there's a fair amount of attrition. Lots of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1814.52s)]
*  good ideas start out, but unless they really translate into a patient benefit, it's hard to [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1820.36s)]
*  see those companies continue. And that's been hard to see. And that's caused certainly a tightening [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1826.76s)]
*  of the financial investments attributed to sort of this segment of the market. But I think a lot [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1833.16s)]
*  of strong companies, including Spur, have survived. That to me is a very encouraging sign. And so [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1838.52s)]
*  as we continue to move forward, gene therapy works. That's where I always like to start. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1845.48s)]
*  Does it work and can it be done safely? Then it's about fine tuning. Can we not just work, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1851.5600000000002s)]
*  but can we actually be better and really leverage the technology? And there's lots of shiny new [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1856.92s)]
*  technologies out there. There's no doubt about it. Gene therapy has tremendous potential from [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1862.44s)]
*  my perspective, because if a disease can be treated with a therapeutic protein, whether it's genetic [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1867.4s)]
*  or not, there's an opportunity if you do it right, to use gene therapy to address that disease. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1874.2s)]
*  That for me sort of creates this unlimited potential in a lot of ways. And certainly at Spur, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1881.0s)]
*  we see a tremendous opportunity to push the field to bigger and bigger conditions, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1887.16s)]
*  where we can have an outsized impact, leveraging the technology with the right approach, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1892.76s)]
*  which is I think what we're doing. Well, it's definitely going to be interesting to see the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1898.12s)]
*  development of new gene therapies over the coming years. Hopefully they are even more successful [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIEcesK-38&t=1907.08s)]
