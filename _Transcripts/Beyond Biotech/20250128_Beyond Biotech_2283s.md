Video Description: Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy uses a person’s own immune cells to fight advanced melanoma, offering new hope for patients who have limited treatment options. 


This week, we have a conversation with Brian Gastman, EVP of medical affairs at Iovance Biotherapeutics, about TILs and the company’s pipeline.


Iovance recently submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency for lifileucel, a TIL cell therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with a PD-1 blocking antibody, and if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor. 


If approved, lifileucel will be the first and only approved therapy in this treatment setting in all European Union member states.


The submission is supported by positive clinical data from the C-144-01 clinical trial in patients with advanced post-anti-PD1 melanoma.


Iovance’s Amtagvi is the first FDA-approved T cell therapy for a solid tumor indication. 


00:47-04:44: About Iovance Biotherapeutics
04:44-07:57: What is polyclonal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte treatment?
07:57-14:55: What is the production process for TILs?
14:55-18:32: Are there any limiting factors for TIL treatment?
18:32-20:59: Is early intervention important?
20:59-21:22: Does better psychology help?
21:22-22:06: Are other companies working on TILs?
22:06-27:25: Clinical trials 
27:25-29:25: How do you address cost?
29:25-34:21: Iovance’s pipeline
34:21-35:30: Can TILs be improved?
35:30-37:21: Where does the TIL space go from here?

# The power of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to fight melanoma
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 109. I'm Jim Cornwell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. The subject this week is tumor infiltrating lymphocyte [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=17.76s)]
*  therapy which uses a patient's own immune cells to fight diseases including advanced melanoma. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=25.16s)]
*  To tell us about the therapy which thankfully is shortened to its acronym TIL or TIL is the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=32.96s)]
*  EVP of medical affairs at Iovance biotherapeutics Brian Gastman. So to get things started then, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=40.36s)]
*  tell me a little bit about the company. Iovance is actually not its original name. It's been [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=49.92s)]
*  around for its current name, somewhere between eight years I believe. I'd have to get the exact [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=56.92s)]
*  numbers but it's not a new company and the idea behind the company is an extension of a discovery [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=62.68s)]
*  that was made decades ago. I'm actually a surgeon by training and it's proud to say that a surgeon [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=71.24s)]
*  at the National Cancer Institute, Steve Rosenberg, who's still doing well, actually we just saw him [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=77.16s)]
*  the other day. He's I think celebrating 50 years running the surgery branch for our government, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=82.16s)]
*  came up with this concept amongst other concepts that solid tumors as opposed to liquid tumors [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=87.6s)]
*  like leukemias and lymphomas, which I think we're going to get to a little bit later with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=93.96s)]
*  Kartit, have within them the immune response that the body chose to send there. So it's already [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=97.28s)]
*  highly vetted immune cells so to speak. So the body thinks it can ward off the cancer by sending [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=103.44s)]
*  its army in. We call it the immune system and within that tumor is a defeated army but an army [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=109.52s)]
*  nonetheless and if we could revive the army, expand the army and give it back to the patient, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=116.12s)]
*  we potentially could make that army effectual all of a sudden, does that make sense? And so [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=121.44s)]
*  that concept helped save people's lives. There were patients who were flying to Bethesda, Maryland [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=127.16s)]
*  and literally have been treated 30 something years ago and were single at the time and now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  are grandparents and that's not a cure. I don't know what is a cure, right? But the problem was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=140.84s)]
*  how do you scale that up? And many companies have tried to scale this up. We're not the only one, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=145.44s)]
*  but we're the only one who's made it this far. So we actually did all the scaling, all the investment [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=151.04s)]
*  that it required, all the expertise and then went through the rigor of an FDA inspection and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=157.64s)]
*  approval, which we went through and after many iterations, including a point at time where the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=164.72s)]
*  FDA basically said, don't do it, you're not ready, which really took a big hit to the company a few [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=172.16s)]
*  years ago, a couple years before I joined even, the company sort of cocooned itself and came back [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=177.52s)]
*  out stronger than ever. It actually brought in the same FDA person who told him that is now my [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=183.08s)]
*  partner in the company, which helped a lot, terrific person, Raj Puri. We now have an FDA approval and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=188.56s)]
*  we have seemingly broken the code to scale something we knew would work, but had been sort of a pipe [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=194.88s)]
*  treatment. In fact, I would say as a former treating physician, we knew it was out there, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=203.96s)]
*  but we had to sort of pretend we didn't see it because it was for the few and they're lucky. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=209.52s)]
*  Because even if you made it out there, who knows what your situation was, who knows you'd be the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  one that was picked of the many patients that they had with the few, what we call slots available. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  And so our goal is to be able to provide that to patients at scale and then move on beyond that and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  make it even better. And that's what Iovance has been, is what it is and what it will be. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=230.96s)]
*  Our strength is really focusing on the unmet needs of solid tumors. Melanoma is generally the one [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=235.88s)]
*  that Dr. Rosenberg focused in on first and made his major impact. And so our goal right now is to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=242.44s)]
*  get the melanoma community better. So we're taking patients who haven't benefited from therapies [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=248.84s)]
*  that have led to Nobel prizes. That's how much the field has changed so much. So what we call the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=255.8s)]
*  first line of therapy, the front line of treatment is actually quite good for melanoma. Unfortunately, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=260.32s)]
*  half the patients fail and then they become basically like Adam, the first human. There's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=265.92s)]
*  not much for them until now, until now until our product is truly the first product that's been [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=270.88s)]
*  FDA approved for melanoma in these what we call not frontline, but second line. Other drugs are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  used in the second line, but they're not approved for that. Ours is. And so we believe and we expect [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=282.56s)]
*  that you will start to see things like death rates get better because of the work that we're doing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  I wonder if you could explain what polyclonal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapies [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=294.48s)]
*  are and how they work on tumors. The reason why this is important is because most people know [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  what CAR T is, or at least they have a basic idea of it. A CAR T is taking a patient's own immune [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=304.8s)]
*  cells, specifically their different types of immune cells. Let's call it, we're going to call these [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=312.24s)]
*  ones lymphocytes without going into too much detail what that means. So these immune cells, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=316.64s)]
*  these lymphocytes, maybe I'll go one step further. When you have an infection, there's a part of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=321.28s)]
*  body that's ready to go. That's called the innate immune system that like sort of attacks, let's say [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=326.8s)]
*  bacteria and so on. But eventually the bacteria changes or a cancer changes, our body has to adapt [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  to that. And then there's something called adaptive immune system, which makes sense, right? That's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=338.4s)]
*  the part that adapts, you know, like your boxing, right? You got to be able to bob and weave, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=342.16s)]
*  That's the adaptive immune system. And those lymphocytes are critical for that. Now, the CAR T [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  doesn't really care which lymphocytes, they just need lymphocytes from that exact patient. Otherwise, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=351.36s)]
*  they'll get rejected. If I put your lymphocytes into me, my body will say, hey, these aren't mine, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  get rid of them. But if they're my own lymphocytes, they'll say, oh, nothing, nothing to see here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Right? So they take random lymphocytes, nothing to do necessarily with the cancer. And they engineer [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=363.6s)]
*  something into those cells without going into too much detail what that is that attacks one target. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=371.44s)]
*  Okay, so that's mono, not poly mono as in like monogamous, right? It attacks one thing only, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=378.88s)]
*  that's it. So if the tumor, which has this thing loses it because it recognizes, oh, every time I [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=385.12s)]
*  have this, I die, that CAR T no longer works, right? That's it, it's over. Right? And that's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=391.6s)]
*  what if you see patients who get CAR T and then are resistant, what they find out is that one target [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=397.6s)]
*  is gone. And so there's no way for that CAR T to work anymore. The differences here is we're not [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=402.32000000000005s)]
*  taking random T cells. We're taking the T cells that are inside the tumor already, the body chose [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=408.16s)]
*  to send there many different types of T cells with many different targets on them. And we rely on that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=414.56s)]
*  polyclonal, right? Many clones, right? Each one came from a standard barrier that cloned out [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=420.96s)]
*  to many. So this one progenitor made this clone and this one made this clone and so on. And that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=428.64s)]
*  multitude of different clones, polyclonal lymphocytes, T cells that are in the tumor, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=434.96s)]
*  we grab all of them. And we hope that those encompass the many targets the tumor has, including [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=440.4s)]
*  enough that if the tumor turns one off or another, there's enough there that it'll keep going after [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=448.0s)]
*  that tumor. It's not sensitive to the loss of one target. And that's the strength. But if you just [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  gave every immune cell in the body, that's basically giving just random lymphocytes from the blood, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=459.44s)]
*  that wouldn't do it. We need it to be concentrated. And then we need to do other things, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=464.24s)]
*  including making them expanded, which is what we do, and also preparing the patient's body, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=468.88s)]
*  which we do right before we infuse it. That's what that means. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=474.24s)]
*  Could you kind of talk me through the production process and how you work with them and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=477.44s)]
*  how they're administered? Sure. So it's important to know that generally in medicine, we do what's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=484.32s)]
*  called working from known to unknown. The known here was the Steve Rosenberg protocol. Now we've [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=489.52s)]
*  made upgrades to that, especially to scale, but a lot of it's very similar. So if you would Google [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=495.04s)]
*  how he does it or other people do, it's pretty similar. But basically, the basics is that it [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=500.8s)]
*  starts with a multidisciplinary group of doctors, healthcare providers identifying appropriate [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=506.16s)]
*  patient, and they have to meet certain criteria for minimum reason of it's the right thing to do. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  And the second reason is that the payer won't pay for it if it's not melanoma or it's not at [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=516.8s)]
*  least second line meaning they had to fill their frontline. And then once that decision is made, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=521.44s)]
*  they then order our drug and tag fee that we have a proprietary software package that they work with. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=526.8s)]
*  And then that engages our sort of wake love service to start to work on a date with them, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  including getting their approval for what's called a tumor harvest. Now that harvest is not a biopsy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=540.16s)]
*  You'll hear that term. It's not it's actual surgical resection of a tumor. So depending on [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=546.4799999999999s)]
*  where that is, imagine if it's just a little thing, let's say it's a tumor in the back of your hand, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=552.0s)]
*  you can just numb that up and take that off really easy. But if it's deep in the liver, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=556.8s)]
*  well, you're gonna have to go to sleep, you're gonna have to have someone who's specialized in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=560.64s)]
*  liver surgery, and they might use a robot, the difference between one harvest and another is [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=564.64s)]
*  dramatically different. But as we all know, good in good out, we want the best tumors, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=569.3599999999999s)]
*  we want viable tumors likely with viable immune cells in those tumors, because that's what we [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=575.04s)]
*  really want. And we will take it from wherever we can get it safely in the patient. And so all [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=580.64s)]
*  these decisions have to work out. And then that coordinates with our system. And the day of the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=585.68s)]
*  surgery is usually the day before we expect to receive it, then we get it, our technicians prep [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=591.92s)]
*  it. And then there's a 22 day process, where we get the immune cells out of the tumor. And then [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=598.0s)]
*  we do what's called a rapid expansion process that expands those cells that we really want. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=604.16s)]
*  Part of the process is not to take what we don't want. And then part of it is to take what we do [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=609.76s)]
*  want and expand that and turn that from millions of cells to billions, even tens of billions of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=614.32s)]
*  cells. Then at the end of that 22 day process, you know, nobody wants an unvetted product. So [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  we take our time to make sure what we're giving them is exactly what they expect to give that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  patient the best chance. And that takes, let's call that, you know, another seven to 10 days range [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=632.0s)]
*  in that range. And by the end of that, the center already knows, hey, your product is good. And you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=637.7600000000001s)]
*  should have been expecting it to be good because we want your patient ready to go because everyday [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=642.4s)]
*  matters. And that patient then comes in on their end, right as our product gets shipped to them. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=646.56s)]
*  And then they start a preparatory phase, which we call lympho depletion. What is lympho depletion? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=652.4s)]
*  It's also used by the way in CAR T cell therapy, almost all cell therapies that you'll see have [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=658.16s)]
*  this, where we basically wipe out temporarily. That's why it's called non-myo-plative. It's [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=662.56s)]
*  temporary. It's not permanent. You'll see in bone marrow transplant world, they completely get [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=668.8s)]
*  rid of the immune system and then just give them back a permanent new immune system. That's not [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=673.5999999999999s)]
*  what happens here. We temporarily get rid of their immune system. And yes, during that time, there's [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=677.28s)]
*  always risks of not having an immune system, but it's very short. And while they're in the hospital, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=683.12s)]
*  and that usually takes about a week, there are people who play with that, but our label says a [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  week. We then give them those cells that I just described. Following that, they get a T cell growth [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=692.24s)]
*  factor. So inside the body, these cells, we want them to expand even further, like to be a bioreactor [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=699.6s)]
*  in that person and expand even further. Now, theoretically, once they touch the tumor, they [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=706.16s)]
*  should get all stimulated and expand. But we add to that, that T cell growth factor is also not a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=710.96s)]
*  new drug. It's called Inulucan-2. IL-2, Prolucan, you'll hear a lot of different names. That drug [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=716.88s)]
*  has been around for years. Actually, Steve Rosenberg also, not surprisingly, helped basically [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=723.36s)]
*  invent that or certainly to use for it. But back in the day, it was this highly toxic drug that was [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=728.16s)]
*  given up to 28 doses. On our regimen, we only give up to six doses. The toxicity is much, much, much [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=734.0s)]
*  less. And this drug has to work on certain immune cells. Well, if there's no immune cells, because [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=740.32s)]
*  we just wiped them out, other than the cells we gave the patient, theoretically, the only effects [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=746.32s)]
*  of that Inulucan-2 should be on the cells we give, which is good. We want them to do that and kill [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=750.6400000000001s)]
*  the tumor. Following that, the patients are in the hospital. It depends on the center. Some centers [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=755.44s)]
*  have more of an avant-garde approach. Some have a very judicious approach. It could be days, weeks. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  The trial was one way, but it was very regimented. So what people do in the real world is really up [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  to them and their experience. But after that hospitalization, patients go home. By that point, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=771.12s)]
*  pretty much all of these side effects of the drugs we gave are gone, except for one. And that is the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=776.16s)]
*  cancer killing part of this, which is what we want. We want the side effect of killing the tumor. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=781.6s)]
*  And so we call it a living therapy. And one of the amazing things when I joined this company, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=786.0s)]
*  to watch, because I was very involved with clinical trials, is to see a therapy in an [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=790.88s)]
*  area where there was literally no long-term studies, because everything didn't work long term. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=796.16s)]
*  And report out four-year follow-up date. That's like in my world, it was crazy. Four-year follow-up [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=800.88s)]
*  world, second line. You mean four months? No, I mean four years. And what we saw is not only [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=806.56s)]
*  the therapy's incredible durability, but that patients who are getting in the world of trials, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=812.64s)]
*  there's progression, meaning it's not working. There is complete response, meaning it's all gone. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=819.04s)]
*  And then there's partial response, which can sometimes be very, very good, almost basically [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=823.5999999999999s)]
*  curative, but you still see some tumor on these scans. And then there's stable disease, like the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=828.72s)]
*  disease is maybe shrinking or growing, but not enough to jump into what we call progressing or [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=833.28s)]
*  responding. And what we saw were patients who were stable disease becoming partial responders [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=839.12s)]
*  months, even years later, and even patients that were partial responses becoming complete, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  meaning we can't see any tumor responders. As much as over two years later, it goes to the point that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=850.96s)]
*  this is a living therapy. It's not a chemotherapy that does its job and then the body, you know, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=856.96s)]
*  you pee it out of your system. That's not what happens here. This becomes part of your immune [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=862.32s)]
*  system. These are your own cells. I'm talking about the patient now, and they go back to you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=866.4000000000001s)]
*  And whatever the body wants to hold on to keep as a memory of what it experienced and bring it back [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  out when needed stays in that patient and sort of develops an immune surveillance to either keeping [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=876.96s)]
*  the tumor at bay longer, or if the tumor decides it's rear its ugly head, it's been hiding somewhere, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=882.96s)]
*  hopefully it'll re-attack it. I think the strength of this isn't just the responders, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  it's the duration of response. Are there any limiting factors? I mean, are there people that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=892.96s)]
*  it doesn't work for and by working on understanding why that's the case? The answer is yes, but I think [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  one of the bigger challenges and who it's not working for, it's who we can't give it to. So, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=905.76s)]
*  for example, children, we are investigating how can we give it to children? They're very old. How [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=910.24s)]
*  can we give it to the very old, the very sick? Regularized patients get very sick, especially [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=915.36s)]
*  they've been treated for a long time, or if they have an underlying medical condition. So, we have [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  investigative trials going on and other trials going on looking at children, looking at changing [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=924.64s)]
*  some of the dosing around the therapy to be able to give it to more patients. So, I think that's one [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=929.6s)]
*  of the bigger limiting factors. It's not a lot of patients. You know, pediatric melanoma is pretty [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=936.16s)]
*  rare, to be honest with you, but still, if a 12-year-old has it, we'd like to be able to treat [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=940.56s)]
*  that 12-year-old, right? If an 80-year-old walks in the door, we want to make sure that they're [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=944.7199999999999s)]
*  healthy enough for it. Interestingly, if you look at frontline therapy, it actually works better [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  in the elderly. So, a large part of our patients are really the patients that we can treat, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=953.52s)]
*  but we're still always looking at the margins. How can we do better for everybody? Yes, it's true [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=960.0s)]
*  that it doesn't help everybody. That's why our overall response rate isn't 100 percent, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=964.72s)]
*  but part of that, believe it or not, is not the therapy. It's actually the patients coming into [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=969.2s)]
*  the therapy, and we've really recognized it. That patient selection is everything, and probably the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=974.4s)]
*  vast, vast, vast majority of patients who are not the best patient right now were at some point a [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=981.44s)]
*  very good patient. And so, educating, especially the doctors who give the frontline and saying, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=988.0s)]
*  this is the best time to make the decision that your frontline is not working and go for this, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=994.4799999999999s)]
*  could really increase the number of patients getting benefit out of this. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=999.28s)]
*  Our average patient on our trial had between three and four lines of therapy, and some had [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1003.52s)]
*  as many as nine lines of therapy, and we still, about 31 percent, got responses. And those patients [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  did really well for a really long time. I mean, some of them are still going, right? My point is, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1015.68s)]
*  is that if you would look at patients who are not three, four, five lines, but had one line, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1021.04s)]
*  and then the question is, how far did you go with that one line? Could you have made that decision [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1027.28s)]
*  earlier? There's still going to be a second line patient, but you realize you now have a bridge to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  something. In other words, in the past, you held onto that front line as long as you could, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1037.12s)]
*  because you really didn't have anything after that. You doubled down, tripled up, you know, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1041.2s)]
*  you kept trying, saying, well, maybe it's working. I'm not sure. Now doctors can say, you know what, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1044.56s)]
*  I knew that wasn't really working. And it's okay, because I got somewhere to take this to. It's [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1049.52s)]
*  called MTAGV. The doctors that do the MTAGV, they know it. They recognize it. The problem is, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1053.2s)]
*  they get the patient from, usually from another doctor. And so we were working on educating the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  entire society of doctors to try to help with that. One way that helped really well for us was an [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1064.08s)]
*  early adoption by the National Cancer Competitive Network, NTCN. The NTCN listed us as a preferred [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1069.84s)]
*  second line therapy, which is terrific. And the NTCN is actually created for community doctors. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1076.08s)]
*  But still, the reality is, it needs to penetrate deeper into the community. The sort of corner [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  medical oncologist, you know, the one who treats everything, really needs to start thinking about, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1087.6s)]
*  because they're also dealing with lung and prostate and all this, really need to get into [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1091.6s)]
*  their standards of practice that make that decision and make that decision early. And then [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1096.08s)]
*  that will help with more patients. So we don't have to do anything to our therapy at all to get [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1101.28s)]
*  to even better responses, better outcomes. We just need to get the patients more optimized. And we [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1106.72s)]
*  know that. Does it help the earlier that somebody gets treated, you can help them quicker? Like if [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  somebody's on their ninth line of therapy, as you mentioned, if you get them earlier, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1117.6s)]
*  you can help them better? Based on our trial, I can't clearly say that. I think that the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1122.56s)]
*  anecdotal evidence is there. But one thing that is probably the strongest point that I can bring to [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  you is data that we presented at ASCO this year. So ASCO, we presented the early trial for what is [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1134.72s)]
*  called TILVance. Our TILVance is actually our, the FDA required us to do a larger face revalidation [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1141.76s)]
*  study. And since there was nothing else in the second line to compare to, they said, go ahead [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1147.28s)]
*  and do it in the front line. But before we did it in the front line, we had already had our 1A data. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1150.96s)]
*  And our 1A data basically had double the responses in patients who have never been treated before. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1156.08s)]
*  I don't want to use other people's TILVance to tell you what our TILVance will do, because it's not [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1161.44s)]
*  our therapy exactly. But if you want to use that as a window, we're not the first ones to try [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1166.88s)]
*  this tumor infiltrating lymphocyte therapy in front line and seeing these remarkable [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1172.48s)]
*  responses. So we know it's there. But the question is, is the community right now, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1176.8799999999999s)]
*  because it's not in the NCCN guidelines, it's not approved, it's not going to use it in the front [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1181.84s)]
*  line. So that's one of the reasons why if we can get as close to front line as possible, we might [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1186.72s)]
*  be able to experience those kind of front line responses. But if you look at our data, it was, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1191.4399999999998s)]
*  I told you 31% on our label for second, third, fourth line TILVance, our data at ASCO was double [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1196.96s)]
*  that in the 60s, maybe more than double the high 60s. So my point is, is that we're expecting that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1206.0s)]
*  on this large phase three trial that if you get 60s, and by the way, we had 30% complete responders, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1212.4s)]
*  that was like incredible. If you look at the best frontline therapies today that led to Nobel prizes, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1219.12s)]
*  and you looked at the same timeframe that we are looking at, meaning it's sort of early, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1225.04s)]
*  because once you have a complete responder, usually that means you're golden in the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1229.76s)]
*  mediterrary world. They were single digit complete responders, responses. Those are the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1232.64s)]
*  Ipnevos of the world, the things that led to like the whole wholesale world change of how we treat [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  cancer in general. So we're starting with a 30% complete response. That's incredible. And I could [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1242.8000000000002s)]
*  tell you for patients who are especially younger, who don't want to just live two or three years, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1248.48s)]
*  but they want to live 10, 20, 30 years, when you tell them numbers like that, that really resonates. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  And I'm sure that that helps with morale as well. I mean, the better your morale is, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1258.72s)]
*  the more likely you are to be able to respond, I guess. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1264.32s)]
*  Parenthetically, there has been data for years in the middle known world that better [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1268.24s)]
*  psychological support equals better outcome, including in immunotherapy. So 100%. Yeah. And [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1272.0s)]
*  the hope side of things is very powerful. There's no question. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1278.0s)]
*  You mentioned other companies. Are there lots of other companies working in this space? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1282.08s)]
*  There are a lot of other companies right now. Some companies have, you know, over the years have [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1286.88s)]
*  fallen by the wayside, because, frankly, it's the scaling up part of it. This is, like I said, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1291.68s)]
*  it's not a new technology. But I think what's happening is people realizing, look, I have [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1297.68s)]
*  ants solve the riddle. How do you scale up what Dr. Rosenberg did? What I will tell you is, is that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1302.64s)]
*  I'm sure we get to this I have ants doesn't sit on its laurels. We have a large pipeline, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1308.72s)]
*  not just to expand this outside of melanoma, which is probably what other companies are trying to do, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1314.24s)]
*  but also to look at what we can do to get to that 100% response rate. We may never get there, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1319.6s)]
*  but that's the goal. Could you tell me a little bit about [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1325.2s)]
*  your path towards commercialization and the clinical trials that you've been working on? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1328.56s)]
*  We're well within commercialization at this point. What's interesting about our company is that [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1334.0s)]
*  you'll see a large number of companies that are what I would call early phase wanting an FDA [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1338.64s)]
*  approval and you have a large number of large companies which have many FDA approvals. But [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1344.8000000000002s)]
*  to have one company get one FDA approval, it's a small, you know, to me, at least in the cancer [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1349.2s)]
*  world, sort of a small space. A lot of companies, if they ever got there, would have been bought out [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1354.4s)]
*  or what have you. And so we really had to do the whole thing. We did the FDA application called [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1358.4s)]
*  Biologic License Agreement, BLA, that was submitted in March of last year. What happens then is they [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1364.48s)]
*  take two months to look at a nearly one million page document and say, you know what, we accept [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1371.44s)]
*  to read the rest of this. That happened in May of last year. In November of last year, which is [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1377.44s)]
*  typically the six months afterwards, they said, you know, this is first in human, we're still [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1382.08s)]
*  learning, you're still learning, give us three more months. So three more months after that is [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1386.8s)]
*  February. And guess what? Approval. And that's how that happened. So on February 16th, 2024, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1390.96s)]
*  we were approved. Now, our approval was based on the LN-144 study, which was the sort of second [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1397.28s)]
*  line plus study of melanoma. There were different cohorts within it. The main one that led to the [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1403.76s)]
*  approval was cohort four, which basically had all the bells and whistles the FDA wanted. They wanted [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1408.72s)]
*  everything externally reviewed. They really wanted as much independence from IOVANCE and the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1414.0s)]
*  investigators as possible. And that's what led to our 31%, 31.4% response rate that you see in the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  label today. There were other cohorts, one of the other cohorts, which is an earlier cohort called [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1426.32s)]
*  cohort two, was actually used to validate cohort four. And if you read our label, the combination [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1431.04s)]
*  of the two data is also listed there as well. So that strengthens the outcomes that we have is by [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1437.6s)]
*  having both of those in that label. By the time February rolled around, we had set up 30 centers [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1443.28s)]
*  to be what we call authorized treatment centers, ATCs, with a plan that two months later in May, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1450.24s)]
*  we would have 50, which we did. And now we've announced that by the end of the year, we will [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1456.08s)]
*  have seven. Now, why so many? Well, actually, we're following the playbook, honestly, of the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  six cell therapies that came before us. We have a lot of cell therapy experience in the company. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say poached, but we certainly grabbed a number of great talent from people who [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1472.3999999999999s)]
*  knew exactly how to launch CAR T's mainly, or manufacture CAR T's, or commercialize CAR T's, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1477.36s)]
*  deal with payers of CAR T's, all of that is in this company. And basically, we followed the playbook. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1483.4399999999998s)]
*  And what we know is that 50% of all CAR T is treated at 10 centers, 80% of CAR T is treated [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1489.28s)]
*  at 40 centers. Many of these CAR T's have over 100 centers in the United States. But which is going [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1496.72s)]
*  to be your 10? Which is going to be your 40? Well, you don't know that off the bat. They're not always [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1501.84s)]
*  for TIL may not be the same 10 as for CAR T. So you have to expand, and you may contract, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1507.28s)]
*  but first you got to have a fishing net out there. Plus, there's a lot of patients who don't want to [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1514.08s)]
*  travel very far for their therapy. And we recognize that. We know our melanoma patients, that's why [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1518.96s)]
*  they brought in melanoma people like me, who really can tell you what the typical melanoma [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1523.92s)]
*  patient will and will not do. And so our goal is to make sure that every patient in this country, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1528.0s)]
*  I don't want to say the tip of Alaska, right, or the farthest island in Hawaii, but in general, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1533.04s)]
*  that everybody could drive to an authorized treatment center. That's our goal. And they [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1537.92s)]
*  don't have to fly with very little means somewhere to get this miracle drug. And part of that isn't [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1542.16s)]
*  just the patients. It's also we don't want resistance from the referring doctors. Because [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1548.0s)]
*  if it's really a pain to get, they might say, well, let's try one more thing. And again, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1552.72s)]
*  as I told you earlier, we want them to make the decision early so we can help the patients the [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1556.56s)]
*  best. And just the one last thing. So I run medical fairs. I'm not the head of commercial, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1560.72s)]
*  but we work shoulder to shoulder with them. And the reason why that's important is because [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1565.28s)]
*  our product is only as good as the patient and the doctor's treating that patient. And so part [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1570.32s)]
*  of my group is to prepare those centers to keep making sure that those centers are at the highest [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1576.16s)]
*  level of excellence. We talk to the surgeons about best practices. We talk to the medical [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1580.88s)]
*  oncologists who refer the patients and set the patients up. We talk to the cell therapists who [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1587.0400000000002s)]
*  generally give the cells themselves and that IL-2 we talk about. And that's a constant exchange of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1591.92s)]
*  communication. And so we have a regular field medical team does scientific exchange, which [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  pretty much every company has. We have our authorized treatment center group that sets that [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1602.96s)]
*  all. We also was called a peer to peer group, which is unusual, which is former health care [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1606.96s)]
*  providers, including myself, that speak to current health care providers to make sure that we [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1611.92s)]
*  optimize this. On top of that, we have a robust commercial team that really has direct line of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1616.48s)]
*  sight with those centers and have developed tremendous relationships with them because we [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1621.92s)]
*  really see this as a partnership. And that's basically where we're at today. We're doing well [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1626.4s)]
*  in our first quarter that we discussed where we are at. We mentioned we had about a hundred plus [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1632.1599999999999s)]
*  orders. That's already a quarter ago. We were no longer discussing that kind of thing anymore [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1638.32s)]
*  because we're, we're talking more about earnings. Cost is a major issue everywhere. How much [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1643.12s)]
*  of an importance do you place on trying to reduce costs? Sure. So there's a couple of things to [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1649.6s)]
*  consider in the world of cell and gene therapy. So we're lumped into that world. The cost to the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1656.48s)]
*  centers is not out of whack because there are gene therapies that are four times our price. So [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1662.72s)]
*  from that perspective, in addition, it's a one time therapy. So I'll give you an example. I [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1667.44s)]
*  remember I was looking at some of the checkpoint inhibitors years ago, and if you got up to two [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1672.56s)]
*  years, I mean, the cost that's millions of dollars. I gave intratumoral therapies all the time. And [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1677.76s)]
*  sometimes we were charging literally millions of dollars over a year of constantly treating with [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1683.2s)]
*  these really expensive drugs. So when you start to look at our one time costs, it actually starts [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1687.8400000000001s)]
*  to actually be very favorable compared to a multi treated therapy, which may be one therapy would be [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1693.04s)]
*  less than ours. But really, if you look at the bigger picture, what you're getting out of it, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1699.52s)]
*  the cost to us and certainly to the hospital starts to seem quite reasonable once you realize [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1703.44s)]
*  what you're comparing it against. In terms of ourselves trying to improve everything, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1708.4s)]
*  there's a lot of optimization that we're doing, but you need to understand that we're constricted by [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1713.2800000000002s)]
*  the approval that we have from the FDA. So we can't make any wholesale changes right now. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1718.5600000000002s)]
*  We can do studies and then we can send them to the FDA and the FDA can prove or not approve them. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1723.6000000000001s)]
*  And all those things can help us be more efficient. And with the efficiency, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1729.0400000000002s)]
*  things can play out from there. But right now, our goal is to optimize where we're at right now. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  Stick with what we're approved to do, costs we've established. And right now, we've had denials, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1738.4s)]
*  all of which I believe today have been overturned. So we don't see that as a barrier right now. And [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1745.52s)]
*  we're seeing is that other gene cell therapies are coming out. I mean, you can look at other [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1750.64s)]
*  companies where it's one, two million dollars per therapy. So right now, I think we're just sticking [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1755.0400000000002s)]
*  to where we're at and before it. And we haven't had much resistance at all with it. And of course, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1760.96s)]
*  that's not the only thing that you're working on. You have a big pipeline. Could you tell me a [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1766.88s)]
*  little bit more about some of the other things in the pipeline? Sure. Our pipeline focuses on, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1771.3600000000001s)]
*  I would say two areas. One is new indications, new cancers that we are not FDA approved, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1777.44s)]
*  as well as what we can do to make the therapy either safer or more efficacious or both. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1784.3200000000002s)]
*  Let me start with the different indications. So we have assessed many different cancer types, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1789.92s)]
*  but the ones we're focusing on right now are lung, specifically non-small cell lung cancer [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1795.04s)]
*  without actual mold mutations, which is a very common type of lung cancer. Lung cancer is 15 [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1800.0s)]
*  times the number of deaths a year than there is melanoma. It's a huge unmet need. The frontline [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  therapies, which also have made a big impact, are not even as effective as they are in melanoma. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1811.6s)]
*  And those patients who are in second line do even worse than the melanoma patient. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1816.8s)]
*  It's a very bad, nasty disease and really in desperate need of something better. And if you [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1821.28s)]
*  look at the landscape, there really isn't a lot of headway that's being made. People are talking [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1827.68s)]
*  about successes and non-statistical results, non-statistically significant results, giving them [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1833.3600000000001s)]
*  enthusiasm. That's not good for patient care. I have an aunt right now who's been diagnosed with [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1839.6000000000001s)]
*  this. It's an awful disease. We've published before. You can look that up in early phase [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1844.64s)]
*  studies. In our press releases, we've talked about our second line trial called LUN202. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1850.08s)]
*  So these are patients who failed standard chemotherapy, who don't have EGFR-ROS or [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1855.9199999999998s)]
*  ALK mutations. We have alignment with the FDA to use that study, just like in melanoma, to go after [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1861.76s)]
*  a second line indication for that population. So that study is ongoing and accruing. And then [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1867.6s)]
*  eventually, like our melanoma playbook, we will need a validation study as well, very similar to [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  what I described in Telvanis in the front line. That's lung and that's a big deal for our company [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1877.92s)]
*  because that's going to really help so many more patients. We can do more with melanoma. We're [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1882.64s)]
*  always trying to do more melanoma, but lung is a huge basket of patients. And what's interesting [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1887.6000000000001s)]
*  about lung is melanoma tends to be highly concentrated in countries with a lot of Caucasians. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1892.96s)]
*  Lung cancer hits every country. So you're not just talking about in the United States, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1898.96s)]
*  it's also as bad or worse in countries where melanoma barely exists. So really, it's an [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1904.32s)]
*  international focus that we're going to have. We have that melanoma, but you can imagine the impact [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1909.84s)]
*  for lung. The most recent indication we've discussed is endometrial cancer. And the reason we're going [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1914.4799999999998s)]
*  after that is very similar. If you look at where there's a good upfront, maybe not perfect, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1919.4399999999998s)]
*  obviously not perfect, upfront immunotherapy-based cancer that does not have a good backup second [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1924.24s)]
*  line, endometrial, it's that perfectly. And that's why we're going after that as well. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1929.84s)]
*  That's emerging and we've publicly announced that. We also have investigator initiated trials and you [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1933.9199999999998s)]
*  can look at clinicaldrives.gov, the ones that we've publicly discussed. There are others that are [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1939.6799999999998s)]
*  really exciting. I can't discuss because they're not public, but a lot of interesting stuff that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1944.1599999999999s)]
*  may lead to bigger trials later. And then we have what we call trying to make our drugs better. So [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1947.76s)]
*  for example, I told you about interleukin-2. So interleukin-2 has its ups and has its downs. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1954.0s)]
*  What can we do that's better? We have a new trial, we call it 3001, where the goal is to take [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1960.0s)]
*  a modified cytokine like IL-2 and use that instead of the proleukin and see if we can do even better [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1965.76s)]
*  for patients, not just on safety, but also efficacy. We've publicly announced that one. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1972.64s)]
*  I'm just going to go in numerical order. 4001 is actually inpatients as we speak. It's the first [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1978.4s)]
*  genetically modified TIL therapy. So it's the TIL from the patient that we then genetically [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1982.96s)]
*  modified and give it back to the patient. The drug that led to all these Nobel prizes basically is [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1987.6000000000001s)]
*  a drug that targets something called PD-1 or program DEF1. You may have heard PD-1, PD-L1 [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1992.88s)]
*  inhibitors. This TIL has no PD-1 in it. It's been knocked out of the cell. It's not just something [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=1997.52s)]
*  we're about to do. We've actually done a safety run-in, so patients have actually received it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2003.68s)]
*  And we're going to continue on with that and we'll see where that goes. We've only done our safety [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2008.0s)]
*  run-in, so there's more to come with that. More recently, we've described what's called 5001. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2012.88s)]
*  5001 is where I don't want to go into too much detail, but another set of kind built into the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2018.88s)]
*  TIL. And it's based off of data, again, from Steve Rosenberg, where he had really incredible results, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2024.16s)]
*  but a lot of toxicity. And we seem to have figured out a way to have our cake and eat it, too. Add [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2029.68s)]
*  that to the therapy without the side effects. That's emerging. We haven't started it yet, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2034.64s)]
*  but we've announced it. So those are really exciting outcomes. There's going to be more [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2039.12s)]
*  coming out very soon. Can't announce more than pretty much what I've told you, but I think [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2043.1999999999998s)]
*  suffice it to say we don't sit on our laurels and we have a very robust preclinical team, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2047.52s)]
*  which is developing preclinical models that are unique for companies that are really exploring [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2052.48s)]
*  where our future will be. We've invested a lot in that group. Looking to the future, could [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2057.52s)]
*  TILs be developed that are more potent and that could be used in a broader range of [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2063.68s)]
*  solid tumors, potentially? So one of the things that limits TIL is the cancers themselves. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2068.08s)]
*  We discussed the patients, getting better patients, maybe getting them in the front line, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2074.48s)]
*  but also the cancers themselves. So in order for TIL to be made, you have to have TIL to work with. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2078.64s)]
*  So if you have what are called cold tumors, tumors that don't really have much TIL in them, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2083.52s)]
*  or they're very few and far between, how do you capture enough of those to make a TIL product? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2087.92s)]
*  There are different concepts to prepare a patient or combine therapies to get TIL into patients that [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2093.2s)]
*  right now may not be the best candidates. We are absolutely looking at that, partnering with other [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2101.04s)]
*  companies and so on. We haven't publicly announced those plans yet, so I'll leave it there, but [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2106.24s)]
*  suffice it to say there's not a cancer type we're not considering, but there's limited hours and [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2112.08s)]
*  limited dollars and we've got to pick something. So we're starting with biggest unmet needs and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2117.12s)]
*  where we can make the first biggest impact and as we learn more, we'll be able to do better for [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2123.12s)]
*  those more difficult ones to treat. What do you think that the TIL space, where does it go from [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2127.8399999999997s)]
*  here in terms of research and development? Well, part of the big rate-limiting issue is manufacturing. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2133.8399999999997s)]
*  It's not hard for a mom-and-pop show, so to speak, to set up what we call a GMP facility [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2140.96s)]
*  and treat one or two patients a year. Maybe they may get a result, may not get a result, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2148.16s)]
*  but to be able to do this where we're getting at tumors from random hospitals and various [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2152.96s)]
*  beaten up shapes and so on and consistently make a product and have alignment with the FDA, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2160.72s)]
*  I think that's going to be tough. So I think simplification of manufacturing is one way that [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2167.2s)]
*  we may see and I think you're going to see people try to work with maybe worse looking tumors, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2173.04s)]
*  smaller tumors, maybe the biopsies will be smaller. One other area that is very interesting is looking [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2178.0s)]
*  at how do we identify what is a tumor reactive and even more so a tumor killing T cell because if you [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2184.64s)]
*  look at the CAR-T world, they only need so many cells to treat patients and I think we may be able [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2191.52s)]
*  to boil this down to an even smaller product that we're giving patients. So those are the kind of [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2197.2s)]
*  concepts that we think about. We've had multiple posters that our pre-clinical team is constantly [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2201.76s)]
*  looking for what's in our product that makes our product do what it does and then once we really [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2208.5600000000004s)]
*  understand that, can we concentrate on that part of the product? Who knows, it might speed up the [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  manufacturing, it might make the product more potent, maybe it's simple. There's a lot of [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2219.1200000000003s)]
*  different things that can come out of that and we're actively working on that side of things. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2223.84s)]
*  Of course the genetic modifications to the TIL, there's many as you can think of, those are the [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2228.08s)]
*  many options to choose from and trying to figure out which genetic modifications, adding, subtracting [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2232.48s)]
*  both combinations, there's a lot to be had. It's always heartening to hear about therapies that [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2237.44s)]
*  can make a difference and even more so when it's for a condition where patients have limited [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2247.36s)]
*  treatment options. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at thebiotech.eu [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kj6uaChSEI&t=2252.8s)]
