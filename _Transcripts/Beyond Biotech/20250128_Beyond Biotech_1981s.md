Video Description: Brixton Biosciences, a clinical-stage life sciences company spun out from Massachusetts General Brigham, has been awarded $2m from the NIH HEAL Initiative to support the development of non-opioid, injectable pain relief solutions.


As part of the NIH's efforts to tackle the U.S. opioid crisis, the funding will advance research into safer, drug-free alternatives to opioid pain management. Brixton’s Neural Ice is an injectable, drug-free pain management technology designed to provide long-lasting relief from chronic and post-operative pain.


On the podcast this week, we have a conversation with Sameer Sabir, CEO and co-founder of Brixton Biosciences, to dive deeper into pain treatment, the opioid crisis, and Brixton’s mission.

# Developing non-opioid pain drugs
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 125. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. This week on our first podcast of 2025 the subject is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=16.92s)]
*  biotech's role in developing new non-opioid pain treatments. Brixton Biosciences is a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=24.18s)]
*  clinical stage life sciences company spun out from Massachusetts General Brigham. It was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=32.42s)]
*  recently awarded two million dollars from the NIH HEAL initiative to support the development of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=38.94s)]
*  the company's non-opioid injectable pain relief solutions. And so our guest on the podcast this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=46.18s)]
*  week is Sameer Sabir, CEO and co-founder of Brixton Biosciences, to dive deeper into pain [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=53.66s)]
*  medication and Brixton's mission. To get things started I wonder if you could tell me a little [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  bit about Brixton Biosciences. Sure Brixton was founded in 2019 but originates from work done at [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=67.82s)]
*  the Mass General Hospital here in Boston which is part of the Harvard Medical School teaching [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=76.14s)]
*  network and in the lab as an academic project this started in around 2012 funded primarily by [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=82.42s)]
*  funding from the DoD to really look at ways to manage pain in alternative ways. And over the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=90.18s)]
*  course of several years of this very translational lab they're very good at actually thinking about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=97.72s)]
*  technologies in the context of how they're ultimately going to be used in patients as well [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=102.9s)]
*  as just the basic science. They brought the technology to a point where we spun it out in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=108.12s)]
*  2019 into Brixton, raised a series A which essentially allowed us to develop a product, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=112.64s)]
*  do some clinical work to demonstrate proof of concept for the approach. Yeah brings us to where [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  we are today which is on the threshold of going into a pivotal regulatory study with FDA. I guess [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  all steps along the way from setting up the company right the way through to commercialization, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  a long journey. The lab did such excellent work in validating the basic science, proving the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=137.24s)]
*  principle of the premise but ultimately you know that's sort of where they I think almost see the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=144.12s)]
*  project as being complete as it were and that's where our work begins which is really sort of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=150.2s)]
*  turning technology into a product, productizing something and then validating it as sort of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=154.12s)]
*  the next journey and the next journey after that is actually going out into the market and selling [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=159.88s)]
*  it and so that's the the next iteration. That's right then you have to start over again with the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=163.8s)]
*  next, well do you have a big pipeline or? So Neural Ice which is the Brixton product, it's a platform [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=169.72s)]
*  ultimately we want to see this as a product that says ubiquitous as lidocaine in terms of the way [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=176.12s)]
*  that it's used. It's an ultra long acting nerve block from our perspective, a drug-free ultra long [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  acting nerve block. We're starting out looking at the musculoskeletal system and specifically at the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=186.36s)]
*  knee. Our first indication is going to be in patients who have chronic pain from osteoarthritis [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=192.36s)]
*  of the knee and from the knee we'll go to the hip, from the hip we'll go to the next joint until we [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=197.8s)]
*  feel that we're at a point where we can have a discussion with FDA about a more general label [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  and then you know we'll see where we go from there. So pipeline yes but the platform is the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=207.56s)]
*  technology is very similar across all the different indications which I think is kind of how it was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=212.28000000000003s)]
*  set up by design in the beginning. Obviously the US is different to the UK and problems are different [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=217.0s)]
*  in different countries but we do hear a lot about the opioid crisis. I wonder if you could before we [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=224.68s)]
*  talk about the things that you're working on if you could explain a little bit about the the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=230.52s)]
*  background and the extent of that problem. Yeah yeah I mean much of this work stems from the opioid [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=235.16s)]
*  crisis. It's certainly not the only aspect to what we're doing. It is or feels like somewhat of a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=242.44s)]
*  US-centric phenomenon and really I think was triggered by frankly some fairly egregious [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=248.76s)]
*  practices in the pharmaceutical industry and I think everyone has probably heard of the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=256.36s)]
*  Purdue Pharma situation and Oxycontin and how that was marketed in a way that wasn't necessarily [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=261.88s)]
*  appropriate back in 80s and 90s and ultimately led to vast numbers of people being prescribed [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=270.2s)]
*  these very strong addictive painkillers for you know often issues that could be managed without [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=279.96s)]
*  that kind of intervention and it's sort of mushroom from there from prescription medications to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=285.24s)]
*  the influx of cheap synthetic opioids from overseas to sort of fuel the crisis as it were as people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=293.16s)]
*  become addicted and require a way to be able to sustain that addiction beyond being able to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  receive prescriptions from their clinicians. So it's kind of gone from this situation that was [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=306.04s)]
*  created by practices in the pharmaceutical industry prescribing patterns that were encouraged [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=311.16s)]
*  in the clinical community to this sort of full-blown crisis of addiction which I think in 2020 took [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=317.64s)]
*  100,000 lives in the US just from overdoses. So it's a very serious issue and has torn apart [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=324.6s)]
*  homes, has torn apart communities. I've been to communities in sort of rural New England for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=330.76s)]
*  example that have been decimated by the opioid crisis and the impact of it is real world. I mean [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=334.68s)]
*  it's actual loss of the ability to provide for families, loss of the ability to function [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=340.28s)]
*  independently for the individuals and you can see how that translates to a societal effect. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=346.76s)]
*  It's a very sad situation and it was only in 2017 that it was actually recognized as a crisis by [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=351.24s)]
*  the federal government in the United States and I will say that there's been sort of a wholesale [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  change in the last decade or so in terms of the way that these medications are prescribed. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=366.52s)]
*  They are obviously medications that are in certain cases still used and are necessary and required [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  but sort of the nuance in how that is done has become much more pronounced. So you're not going [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=375.72s)]
*  to walk into the doctor for some back pain now and walk out with a bottle full of Vicodin which is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=381.24s)]
*  an opioid. I had my wisdom teeth taken out I think 15 years ago and just after I moved to the US and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=386.68s)]
*  you know walked out of the dentist's office with a prescription for 30 opioid pills which is more [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=393.16s)]
*  than enough to get me through the pain from having my wisdom teeth removed and also more than enough [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  to get me addicted and in real trouble. And actually one of the reasons why I got really [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=404.44s)]
*  interested in this technology was that I had a friend whose father-in-law was a pastor, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=408.68s)]
*  had colorectal cancer, had surgery, the cancer was cured but he got addicted to opioids from the pain [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=414.04s)]
*  from the cancer surgery and died a year or two later which was very striking to me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=421.08s)]
*  So it's a real serious issue, it takes real lives, it has real impact on communities. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=427.32s)]
*  It's kind of gone beyond the point where I think prescription of opioids by clinicians is the only [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=432.36s)]
*  issue anymore. There's much more of a sort of illicit drug use component to it now as well. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=439.56s)]
*  That said, there is a causal link between its use in the medical community and sort of the impact [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=444.28000000000003s)]
*  that it's had and I think this originated sadly in part in our industry and I think it's incumbent [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=449.72s)]
*  on our industry to do what we can to provide better alternatives for patients so that they [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=456.52s)]
*  don't suffer from the horrifying consequences of addiction. I guess people see drugs as an urban [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=462.28s)]
*  young people issue but clearly with prescription drugs it really knows no boundaries. Yeah, I [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=470.52s)]
*  think of them as unwitting victims. If I'm in my 60s or 70s and I go to the doctor because I have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=477.88s)]
*  some pain in my wrist and I get given an opioid and suddenly I'm addicted to opioids, I didn't [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=483.0s)]
*  want to be. Many, many folks have ended up in that situation and that's kind of the tragedy of it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=487.88s)]
*  I think we're past the point of trying to pin blame on how it started and why it started and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=495.32s)]
*  who was responsible. I think most of that has become pretty clear over the years and at this [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=499.8s)]
*  point beyond accountability for victims and justice for victims, I'm not sure it really matters that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=504.76s)]
*  much going forward and our energies at least are better spent focusing on what can we do to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=510.12s)]
*  figure out an alternative that is much more helpful to patients. I know that obviously you can buy [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=516.04s)]
*  over-the-counter pain relief medication but obviously that isn't capable of dealing with [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  high-end pain. Are there any current alternatives to opioids for the severe pain? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=531.0s)]
*  You know it's a great question and maybe I'll sort of answer that by breaking down with some [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=537.8s)]
*  generalization how I see pain therapies in general in terms of buckets or categories. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=543.4s)]
*  You can buy paracetamol, Tylenol, ibuprofen at the pharmacy and those products are reasonably [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=549.96s)]
*  effective for most aches and pains but like you said don't necessarily have the strength to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=556.2s)]
*  address more serious issues. There are several different prescription medications that are not [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=562.76s)]
*  opioids that are also effective for managing pain of various different classes. I have been around [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=569.24s)]
*  for a long time stronger non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for example and things [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=574.44s)]
*  like gabapentin which are neuromodulators. There are definitely other alternatives available. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=579.64s)]
*  They're systemic medications right so you pop a pill and they aren't necessarily targeted towards [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=585.16s)]
*  the specific pain that you're trying to get to and then you have injectables right so local [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=590.44s)]
*  anesthetics like lidocaine, bupivacaine and so on and so forth that you inject in the area that you [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=594.44s)]
*  have the pain and it blocks the pain for a certain period of time. With the systemics you need to take [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=600.5200000000001s)]
*  pills regularly in order to maintain the pain relief with the local anesthetics. They work [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  really well but they don't work for a particularly long time. From a standard shot of lidocaine for [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=610.84s)]
*  example you may get several hours of pain relief and with some of the more newfangled products in [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=615.72s)]
*  that category maybe you get a day a day and a bit of pain relief. Then the third bucket of therapies [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=621.88s)]
*  are in my mind interventions so it's not a pill it's not an injection it's more of a procedure [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=628.44s)]
*  and they generally fall into the ablative category and what we mean by ablative is that they are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=634.36s)]
*  procedures that use tools to actually ablate or damage or destroy the nerve that is conducting [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=640.68s)]
*  the pain signal and that tends to be a longer lasting solution when it works but the when it [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=646.04s)]
*  works piece is important. There are a whole class of products known as ablative tools they're [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=653.2399999999999s)]
*  typically probes that either heat up to very hot or very cold temperatures and the goal is to try [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=657.16s)]
*  and touch the nerve with that probe and with that you do a form of reversible damage to the nerve. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  Typically you ablate the nerve so it sort of undergoes a degeneration and it comes back over [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=667.8s)]
*  time but that time could be six months or so and that's the period during which the patient [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=672.04s)]
*  experiences relief but if you can imagine how small and thin and hard to find some nerves are [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=676.5999999999999s)]
*  and then trying to hit that nerve with the tip of a pin it's not an easy thing to do even when [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  we're employing imaging modalities like fluoroscopy or ultrasound and so on and so forth. So there are [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=688.76s)]
*  a number of different alternatives available to manage pain and pain itself is also a very [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=694.12s)]
*  heterogeneous term. There are many many different types of pain and many of them require different [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=698.6s)]
*  types of interventions so I think there's never going to be such a thing as a panacea for the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=703.48s)]
*  treatment of pain. I think that's the first thing that we all need to understand. There is a lot of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=708.12s)]
*  room for innovation in the space because many of these approaches have been around for a long time [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=712.76s)]
*  and there are many different types of pain to target. Yeah absolutely and then of course you [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=717.32s)]
*  run into issues such as not just the addiction issue but the fact that quite often after a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=722.36s)]
*  certain period of time it starts to lose its effectiveness and also you have the issue of [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=728.2s)]
*  you're addressing the pain but you're not necessarily issuing the reason for the pain. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=734.2s)]
*  Yeah and that's why opioids were great as a way to mask all of that in a way you just throw [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=739.48s)]
*  something at a problem that overpowers it overwhelms it and patient feels great for a while and then [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=744.36s)]
*  the real issues kind of come to light. You're right there are many different factors to this and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=749.0s)]
*  managing pain requires not just good therapies but also a thinking clinician in order to be effective. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=754.76s)]
*  Could you tell me a bit about how Neural Ice was developed and how it all works? Yeah absolutely [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=760.84s)]
*  it's a fascinating story actually. This technology was developed at the Wellman Center for [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=768.2s)]
*  Photomedicine at Mass General Hospital and the inventor is a very prolific scientist clinician [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=773.0s)]
*  inventor here in the Boston area called Professor Rox Anderson who has been responsible for many [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=780.76s)]
*  innovations in the medical space including laser hair removal for example he invented in the 90s. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=786.6s)]
*  He's a dermatologist by training but is very broad in his reach in terms of the work that he's done. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=793.0s)]
*  He invented a technology called CoolSculpting back in 2008 which is a very widely used approach to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=798.92s)]
*  remove fat non-invasively for aesthetic purposes. However what they noticed in the early work in [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=807.24s)]
*  those patients was that the way that CoolSculpting works is you basically take fat like love handles [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=814.36s)]
*  or whatever and sandwich it between two plates that you then cool down and what that does is it [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=819.56s)]
*  induces a process known as cryolipolysis in the fat cells which basically means that the cooling [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=824.36s)]
*  induces the fat cells to undergo programmed cell death and dying. And what they noticed in these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=831.08s)]
*  patients was that these patients were getting reduced sensational numbness at the site where [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=837.4s)]
*  they received this treatment for long periods of time, months at a time, which is a little [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=841.48s)]
*  unusual if you think about it because if you put an ice pack on a sprain it brings the pain down [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=846.28s)]
*  for a period of time but once you remove the ice pack the pain comes back pretty quickly so [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=850.28s)]
*  in around 2010 Professor Anderson got very interested as to why these patients were [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  experiencing this long-lasting loss of sensation and started investigating that in his lab alongside [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=859.24s)]
*  another scientist named Dr. Lillie Goribian ultimately identified that nerves have what's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=865.8s)]
*  known as a myelin sheath. Many nerves have what's known as a myelin sheath which is essentially a [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  fatty layer around the nerve that helps with conducting the signal that transmits pain or [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=878.76s)]
*  whatever else you're trying to transmit and that these cooling processes were inducing this [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=883.64s)]
*  cryolipolysis in the cells in the myelin sheath around the nerve and therefore dampening down [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=890.2s)]
*  the conductivity of the nerves. And it was a pretty interesting finding because it was completely [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=895.24s)]
*  incidental almost perpendicular to the objective of that technology it was an aesthetic medicine [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=901.48s)]
*  procedure that resulted in this really interesting finding that ultimately hopefully to be part of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  the solution for pain and they started playing around with I shouldn't say playing around they [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=911.64s)]
*  started investigating how this could potentially be used to treat things like cutaneous pain and itch [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=916.6s)]
*  issues where nerves are close to the surface of the skin and you can get to them just by cooling [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=923.0s)]
*  topically but they progressed pretty quickly to essentially trying to understand how to inject [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=927.96s)]
*  cold around nerves to be able to target nerves anywhere in the body and trigger this process. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=933.4s)]
*  So that was the technology that Brixton was founded around and inherited was essentially [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=938.28s)]
*  the ability to be able to inject cold around the nerve i.e. therefore neural ice and the product [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=942.3599999999999s)]
*  itself is very simple in the sense that it is a sterile pre-filled syringe that comes with a [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=949.16s)]
*  material already in the syringe that is frozen before use and then is injected frozen and all [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=955.56s)]
*  of the components of the formulation are excipients they are inactive ingredients [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=961.8s)]
*  and the mechanism of action is purely physical so you inject this material around the nerve [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=967.64s)]
*  and it induces this process of cryo-lipolysis of the lipid ridge tissue in the myelin sheath which [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=974.12s)]
*  then triggers this dampening down or degeneration of the nerve that eventually comes back over time [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=980.8399999999999s)]
*  but like the ablative approaches it lasts for much much longer than traditional injection [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=986.3599999999999s)]
*  and our goal up front was really to try and make this as simple and familiar and easy to use [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=991.32s)]
*  as a local anesthetic so that was a big design consideration for us was that this really should [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=997.0s)]
*  look smell feel like a local anesthetic as much as possible so that there's not a big barrier to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1003.1600000000001s)]
*  adoption it's a new technology but it's a familiar form factor and people know how to use it but [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1008.12s)]
*  local anesthetics don't last very long and so the objective of the technology was to give [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1013.5600000000001s)]
*  the durability of the ablative approaches without the complexity so we're trying to marry up [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1018.6s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier the sort of second and third categories of therapies in this area the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1023.96s)]
*  local anesthetics which are easy to use and but don't last very long in the ablative approaches [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1028.6s)]
*  that do last for long but are very difficult to use and often therefore aren't used correctly and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1033.48s)]
*  don't work. How often do you need to give the injection? So our goal is that a single injection [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1038.04s)]
*  will provide three to six months of relief now we are at the point where we've done one first [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1046.84s)]
*  in man study and the data from that study has been really exciting actually it appears to be [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1052.4399999999998s)]
*  safe and it appears to be long lasting we're now entering into a large randomized controlled pivotal [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1060.36s)]
*  study in knee patients we actually just enrolled our first patients this week in this study which [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1067.72s)]
*  will be several hundred patients which will give us a lot more information as to how effective this [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1074.12s)]
*  is in helping patients but the goal is the aim is one shot for three to six months of relief [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1079.9599999999998s)]
*  which if you're undergoing a surgical procedure if we ultimately pursue surgical labels that would [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1085.4799999999998s)]
*  be sort of one shot before surgery and then hopefully you know you're done but for chronic [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1090.9199999999998s)]
*  pain which is an area that we're very interested in the goal would be to only have the patient have [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1094.9199999999998s)]
*  to come in once every several months for an injection and in our clinical studies these [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1100.12s)]
*  injections take less than five minutes so this would be hopefully a very quick procedure not akin [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1105.2399999999998s)]
*  to you know having some kind of a surgical procedure. You mentioned that you're starting [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1110.04s)]
*  with knees is it something that would be suitable for all different kinds of pain and for different [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1114.9199999999998s)]
*  levels of pain or do you envisage it just being for kind of severe pain? No no I mean let's take [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1122.28s)]
*  a knee patient as an example for a second when a knee patient presents with knee pain from [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1129.4s)]
*  osteoarthritis the first intervention is usually PT ibuprofen and so on and so forth but the first [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  real intervention is a steroid shot and that steroid shot the first steroid shock can provide [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1142.2s)]
*  some relief from the pain not by targeting the pain directly but by targeting the inflammation [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1149.0800000000002s)]
*  from the osteoarthritis but subsequent steroid shots start to get more and more dangerous for [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1153.24s)]
*  the patient because they can degenerate cartilage so you can give these patients maybe one or two [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1159.0s)]
*  steroid shots and then you know what comes after that there are hyaluronic acid products [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1164.04s)]
*  sort of that try and create buffer in the space in the knee that are widely used but are not [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1169.72s)]
*  particularly effective and then there are these ablative tools to try to kill the pain when it [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1174.28s)]
*  gets very severe and then there's a total knee replacement which is a surgical procedure and even [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1178.44s)]
*  after a total knee replacement 20 percent of patients continue to suffer chronic pain [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1184.2s)]
*  so basically after that first steroid shot all the way through to after the patient [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1189.4s)]
*  has had a total knee replacement and is still experiencing chronic pain there aren't really [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1193.72s)]
*  any good options for patients to manage this pain and we think that this is something that could fit [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1199.56s)]
*  throughout that entire continuum after that first steroid shot where the pain is often not severe [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1205.0s)]
*  we obviously need to prove that out through good clinical studies over time but you know this is [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1212.2s)]
*  not going to replace ibuprofen or paracetamol but it could certainly replace that first intervention [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1216.52s)]
*  that patients have before things get too crazy and continue to help the patient as they sort of [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1221.56s)]
*  progress as you said earlier just because we're helping with the pain we're not fixing the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1226.28s)]
*  underlying problem either and we need to be mindful of that so if a patient needs a knee [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1231.48s)]
*  replacement because they're bone on bone they need a knee replacement but often a patient who is [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1236.52s)]
*  45 doesn't necessarily want to have any replacement at 45s and one wants to find a way to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1241.4s)]
*  be able to delay that surgery for five years 10 years and so there are many different [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1247.0800000000002s)]
*  aspects as to how this could be used in the long term but you know we sort of dream big but we [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1251.64s)]
*  focus on proving out one thing at a time and so that's the approach we're taking. How quickly does [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1257.16s)]
*  it take effect? In our early clinical work we see a onset time of you know three to five days and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1262.1200000000001s)]
*  it's because the mechanism of action is really a physical mechanism of action here versus a [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1269.32s)]
*  biochemical mechanism of action so it takes a bit of time for the induction of the cryolipolysis [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1273.32s)]
*  and so on and so forth but it's pretty consistent in that time frame and actually that tags back [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1278.52s)]
*  pretty well to all of the preclinical animal work that was done similar timeline for onset of action [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1284.12s)]
*  so a few days. Are there any side effects associated with this treatment? You know not really [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1289.24s)]
*  nothing that has caused us any concern. It's a painful injection the particular injection [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1296.92s)]
*  that we're doing in this first study. We're targeting the genicular nerves around the knee [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1303.0800000000002s)]
*  which are very close to the periosteum which is very sensitive to touch so sometimes if the needle [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1307.0800000000002s)]
*  touches the periosteum it could be a little uncomfortable for the patient during the procedure [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1312.52s)]
*  but that was really the biggest issue that we saw and that's unfortunately the case whatever type [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1316.92s)]
*  of approach you try and use to target that nerve but in terms of the product or the material itself [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1322.68s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier it consists entirely of excipients which are by nature inactive ingredients [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1328.3600000000001s)]
*  that shouldn't have any safety concerns they're all on the FDA's generally regarded as safe [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  safe list the grass list. We felt as if this approach would be the approach that maintained [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1341.0800000000002s)]
*  the cleanest safety profile for patients obviously we need to prove that out in studies and so on and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1348.04s)]
*  so forth but so far so good we're happy with the safety profile from the early data. Could you maybe [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1352.12s)]
*  go over the difference between the use of opioids and non-opioids for treatment of pain? Opioids [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1358.76s)]
*  aren't really used as much in the treatment of chronic pain as they were in the height of the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1368.12s)]
*  opioid crisis so it's become common practice now to use non-opioid based systemic medications to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1373.8s)]
*  try and help these patients and systemic medications by their nature affect every cell in the body [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1381.88s)]
*  and so they are very appropriate and very relevant in certain types of pain so for example [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1389.48s)]
*  this is kind of my view if a patient has a crush injury or has been in a car accident or has [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1396.44s)]
*  diffuse injury that's causing pain there's no alternative really to a systemic medication [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1402.5200000000002s)]
*  however when you have the understanding and the ability to be able to target a nerve that you know [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1408.04s)]
*  is transmitting pain why not target that nerve and provide pain relief to the patient without having [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1415.32s)]
*  to take a pill that affects every cell in the body that's kind of the basic philosophy behind [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1422.92s)]
*  not just what we're doing but also behind the local anesthetic approach right regional anesthesia [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  target the nerve specifically so you don't have to target the entire body the problem with that [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1432.28s)]
*  approach historically has been that those products just don't last very long so if we have an approach [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1436.28s)]
*  that now does last orders of magnitude longer in certain instances that makes more sense than popping [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1440.84s)]
*  a pill so i think the more apt discussion is sort of mapping out what makes sense to treat regionally [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1446.44s)]
*  and what makes sense to treat you know more globally in terms of how pain is treated these patients [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1453.16s)]
*  people seem to have different pain thresholds and different reactions to pain are there different [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1458.76s)]
*  reactions to neural ice there absolutely is and that is because pain is a very individual thing [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1465.24s)]
*  it's partly physical and it's partly central right it's partly psychological our goal as with most [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1471.16s)]
*  other pain therapies honestly is to try and provide patients with uh you know 50% of relief if you base [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1476.76s)]
*  it on a rating system so if a patient has pain that's at seven out of ten we want to get them [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1483.0s)]
*  down to you know three to four out of ten that's the difference between severe pain and mild pain [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1488.44s)]
*  that could be the difference between being able to walk down the stairs and not walk down the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1493.16s)]
*  stairs so each patient is almost their own control so yes they do react differently every every [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1497.16s)]
*  individual has a different perception of pain but they can benchmark that against their own experiences [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1502.92s)]
*  and so as long as we can provide that patient with a benefit that they feel is markedly different [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1508.28s)]
*  that's really kind of what's important and it's kind of one of the reasons why clinical studies [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1512.52s)]
*  in this space is so difficult to design and to execute because of that and also because of the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1516.92s)]
*  placebo effect from these therapies it's a very interesting and challenging question to be able [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1520.84s)]
*  to design good clinical studies that you know really sort of capture exactly what you just said [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1528.6s)]
*  so does that mean that you have to change doses at all our goal is to essentially target the nerve [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1533.72s)]
*  in question and to damp it down and so we're using a standardized dose in this first study [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1539.72s)]
*  and i think that's part of the benefit of our mechanism of action being physical and not [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  biochemical metabolic and so on and so forth there's no real concept of it's too much you [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1550.68s)]
*  know like from a drug standpoint there's two they're taking too much this material ultimately [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1557.64s)]
*  breaks down melts and is absorbed by the body within a day and the sort of the cold action [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  is gone within about 10 minutes so we're starting out with a one-size-fits-all approach in a defined [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1567.4s)]
*  category of patients but the whole point of that is also to learn right so that may not be where [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1573.8000000000002s)]
*  we ultimately end up we're certainly still in the clinical trial phase and so are working to [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1577.8s)]
*  learn and to understand as well as to get to a point where we can take this to market speaking [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1584.36s)]
*  of market when you go into a pharmacy or to a drug store you get that over-the-counter pain [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1590.2s)]
*  medication that's extremely cheap what's the cost effectiveness i guess of neural ice how does it [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1596.52s)]
*  compare yeah there's nothing particularly complicated or expensive about the material [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1603.4s)]
*  so we should be able to manufacture this very efficiently and be able to drive much more [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1610.6000000000001s)]
*  drug-like margins than the typical medical device technically we will be regulated as a device even [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1617.96s)]
*  though our product is an injectable but we hope to have more drug-like margins in terms of how [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1624.68s)]
*  expensive it will be to the end user or to the consumer that will probably vary based on whether [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1630.84s)]
*  this is in the us or in europe or canada and elsewhere in the world where pricing systems are [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1635.8799999999999s)]
*  so different but what we hope is that this is not a technology that we're developing to be used in a [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1640.44s)]
*  small subset of patients this is something that we ultimately want to see as ubiquitous as lidocaine [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1646.52s)]
*  and other local anesthetics and so by that very statement we expect this to be a cost-effective [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1652.44s)]
*  solution that can be deployed very very broadly is our fervent goal are there other companies [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1658.04s)]
*  working on not the same thing that you're working on but are there other companies working on [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1663.72s)]
*  alternatives to opioid treatments there are yeah thankfully and by the way i think we welcome any [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1668.44s)]
*  and all attempts and programs to address this frankly pretty horrific situation at least here [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1674.6s)]
*  in the u.s when it comes to the opioid crisis and also address the fact that in an aging population [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1681.8s)]
*  managing pain effectively becomes you know ever more important so there are a number of companies [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1687.08s)]
*  both big and small that are working on different approaches to treating pain including you know [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1691.56s)]
*  some of the largest biotechnology companies in the country such as vertex who have a very interesting [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1696.76s)]
*  program with a sodium channel blocker all the way down to startups that are working on various [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1701.48s)]
*  different approaches to repurpose existing products such as lidocaine or bupivacaine into [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1707.08s)]
*  modalities that might last a bit longer through you know some form of extended release [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1713.24s)]
*  or other drug delivery mechanism and they're all important pain is not panacea and so i think that [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1718.28s)]
*  the fact that there are multiple different groups working on this problem is a great thing what are [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1724.2s)]
*  the challenges when it comes to developing non-opioid pain relief treatments you know i think the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1730.1200000000001s)]
*  challenge with any pain treatment is doing a good clinical study that actually demonstrates that it's [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1736.1200000000001s)]
*  doing something a big factor in pain and in pain studies is the placebo effect you know kind of the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1742.44s)]
*  equivalent of your mom giving you a sugar pill when you're a kid and that made you feel that [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1748.92s)]
*  something was happening and then you got better but it was a sugar pill and you see the same thing [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1756.2s)]
*  in pain it's kind of interesting how when a patient thinks they're getting a treatment it actually [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1761.16s)]
*  gives them some benefit for a period of time so teasing out whether your product is actually [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1765.72s)]
*  having a real impact on that pain or whether it's just placebo effect that the patient is [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1770.52s)]
*  experiencing kind of gets to the heart of designing a clinical study in this field and that's probably [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1774.76s)]
*  the trickiest part of doing studies in pain in general in terms of the opioid specific piece [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1781.0s)]
*  you know because our product is injectable and single use almost as it were one shot for months [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1787.8s)]
*  of relief i think the addiction aspect is kind of addressed by default because of that i always [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1794.04s)]
*  find it very interesting when we think about systemic non-addictive medications because [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1801.8s)]
*  it's probably possible to get addicted to anything i mean there are people addicted to coca cola there [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1809.0s)]
*  are people addicted to salp candies addiction is a very complex mechanism in the first place so [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1813.8799999999999s)]
*  i imagine that for those products the challenge in the studies that they need to do is to is to [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1820.68s)]
*  show that just because you're not hitting an opioid receptor does that really mean that you're not [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1825.3999999999999s)]
*  creating any addiction issues so there are many challenges to sort of doing good work in this [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1831.24s)]
*  space and getting to a good product but they're the right challenges to be addressing and you [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1835.32s)]
*  need to be able to show that you're addressing them right otherwise we'll just end up in the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1839.1599999999999s)]
*  same place as we did a couple of decades ago is there anything else that you're working on or i [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1842.2s)]
*  know you were saying that you're moving from the knee to different parts of the body but is that [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1848.76s)]
*  really what you're concentrating on or are there other things so within bricks then our focus is [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1853.8799999999999s)]
*  on dream big but focus and get you know the first few things over the hump and from there you know [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1858.84s)]
*  the world is your oyster so we're very interested in the knee we're very interested in the hip [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1863.96s)]
*  in the hand other joints where patients typically where a high number of patients experience pain [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1868.52s)]
*  because of diseases like osteoarthritis but the reality is that we can target nerves anywhere in [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1874.76s)]
*  the body and ultimately we want to be able to target nerves anywhere in the body to provide [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1879.96s)]
*  pain relief but there are also other functions that nerves have as we know that if you want to [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1885.16s)]
*  tamp them down could potentially have therapeutic benefits so some of the things outside of pain [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1891.0800000000002s)]
*  that we've thought about just off the top of my head and i'm making it very clear that we have [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1895.0800000000002s)]
*  no programs in these areas whatsoever i think they're just interesting indications that we [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1899.72s)]
*  could potentially think about are things as diverse as cancer pain overactive bladder [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1903.72s)]
*  sleep apnea i mean there are many things that we can potentially address by targeting nerves [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1909.88s)]
*  but we're going to walk before we can run what kind of timeline are you looking at for [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1915.4s)]
*  neural ice our hope is that we would be going to fda in late 26 late 2026 for our first [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1919.88s)]
*  potential regulatory submission if all of our recruitment plans go [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1928.1999999999998s)]
*  somewhat according to plan in our clinical studies and so on and so forth [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1932.4399999999998s)]
*  really interesting to hear about the issues with opioid drugs and potential solutions for better [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1941.2399999999998s)]
*  pain management in the future don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1948.36s)]
*  the biotech.eu and i hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead thanks for [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4ev7e6oqM&t=1955.32s)]
