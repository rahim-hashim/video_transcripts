Video Description: Inflammation appears to affect almost every part of the human body as we age, including cancer, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative disorders.


NLRP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation is at the root of nearly all disease pathologies including fibrotic, dermatological, rheumatological diseases as well as neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.


Halia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a novel class of small molecule medications designed to combat inflammation.


Halia Therapeutics’ candidates are the first drugs to target the protein NEK7 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity to resolve chronic inflammation in multiple diseases.


Its lead candidate, HT-6184 is currently being evaluated in two phase II studies – for the treatment of post-procedure inflammatory pain response and cancer (lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS).


The company also recently announced a new collaboration to leverage AI in the clinical development of its new Alzheimer's disease drug, HT-4253, targeting a mediator of neuroinflammation called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2).


This week, or guest is Dave Bearss, CEO of Halia Therapeutics.

# Targeting inflammation: A revolution in disease treatment
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 110. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. The subject this week is a wide-ranging conversation on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=17.04s)]
*  inflammation, including in Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation appears to affect almost every [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=23.88s)]
*  part of the human body, including as we age. It's also true of diabetes, cancer, obesity, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  and neurodegenerative disorders. Heliotherapeutics is pioneering a novel class of small molecule [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=38.84s)]
*  medications designed to combat inflammation. So on the podcast this week to tell us all about [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=47.48s)]
*  inflammation in disease, why it should be stopped, and how, is Halia CEO David Beers. And first, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=55.12s)]
*  I asked about the origins of the company. We started Helia about seven years ago. It's hard [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  to believe it's been seven years, but we started with myself, my brother who's involved in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=71.92s)]
*  company, and then one of our co-founders, a guy named Keoni Kawai. And Helia is actually a Hawaiian [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=77.6s)]
*  name and Keoni, as you probably can guess from his name, he's from Hawaii. So not many Hawaiian [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=83.88s)]
*  scientists floating out there, but he's one of the few that I've met. But he's a human geneticist, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=89.08s)]
*  and so he trained at Washington University in St. Louis, which is a very famous medical school [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=95.2s)]
*  in the United States. And he worked with a team there that was involved in trying to understand [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=101.08s)]
*  the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. And he made a really interesting discovery and came to us and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=105.96s)]
*  said, hey, I think I found something interesting genetically of how we could modulate risk for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=113.6s)]
*  Alzheimer's disease for people that have high risk genetics. We started the company actually [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=119.88s)]
*  around this observation that he made. And it was related to a very well known risk factor called [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  APOE4. So you probably have heard of it. It's quite a well studied risk factor for Alzheimer's. So if [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  you have one copy of APOE4, your risk for Alzheimer's is like three times higher than the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=138.32s)]
*  general population. If you have two copies of APOE4, it's a genetic variant of the APOE gene, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=143.28s)]
*  there's APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. And if you have two copies of APOE4, your risk for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=148.88s)]
*  Alzheimer's is very, very high, probably close to 90%. So when he was a postdoctoral fellow in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=154.8s)]
*  St. Louis, they had done a lot of work identifying this particular risk factor. And he was looking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  for other genetic modifiers. So if people have APOE4 plus something else, does it make them more [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=167.84s)]
*  or less susceptible to getting Alzheimer's disease? And so he found a family when he moved back here [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=175.08s)]
*  to Utah. And Utah is kind of a hotbed for human genetics. We actually have very large families [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=180.64s)]
*  here. And we established many years ago, a resource for human geneticists called the Utah [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=187.04s)]
*  population database. And what we did is we took the health records, the public health records of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  the state of Utah, and we merged them with the Mormon Church's genealogical database. And so what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  that allows us to do is we can ask questions like, show me a family in Utah that has Alzheimer's in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=203.88s)]
*  four generations, and you can pull that right up on the database. And so it allows us to find [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=209.16s)]
*  families that have interesting genetic potential genetic susceptibility to different diseases. And [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=215.04s)]
*  the use of that database has really led to a lot of discovery of genes that are involved in lots of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=220.48s)]
*  diseases, including a lot in the cancer world. So he found a family here in Utah that had Alzheimer's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=226.92s)]
*  in multiple generations. And that usually indicates that they have something genetically going on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=233.2s)]
*  And he discovered that this family had APOA4 in the family. And so he started to look at individuals [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=238.36s)]
*  that were affected by Alzheimer's. And he discovered there were several people that in this family that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=244.96s)]
*  were dual positive, had two copies of APOA4. He found something interesting, though, as he started to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=251.08s)]
*  study siblings in this family. He found 12 individuals that were over 70 years old, that had [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=257.2s)]
*  two copies of APOA4, and they didn't have any signs of cognitive defect. And so that's, that's unusual [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=265.24s)]
*  to have people that age that have two copies of APOA4 that show no cognitive decline at all. And so [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  he thought maybe there was a possibility that this family had something else that could actually [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=277.8s)]
*  modulate their risk for Alzheimer's. And so we actually got 230 family members together, we [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  sequenced their DNA, and we discovered that they had another mutation that protected them from this [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=289.12s)]
*  risk factor. So we started the whole company around trying to understand the biology around that, and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=295.16s)]
*  seeing if we could turn that into a therapeutic strategy where we could phenocopy or copy that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  mutation with a drug. And so that's what we've done. We actually came up with two different [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=305.48s)]
*  strategies. So we discovered what this mutation did, what it did to the biology and how that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  protected people from Alzheimer's. And basically, a very long story short, what we discovered is a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=316.76000000000005s)]
*  novel way to turn off inflammation, chronic inflammatory signals that is involved in driving [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=322.96s)]
*  diseases like Alzheimer's. And what we discovered is it's involved in driving many other diseases [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=329.28s)]
*  involved with inflammation. And so we've come up with a new, actually a couple new strategies of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=333.88s)]
*  how to target chronic inflammatory signaling. And we have two drugs in the clinic now. And we're [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=338.76s)]
*  excited to see what they look like as we move them forward in multiple phase two clinical trials. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=344.56s)]
*  I know we're going to be talking a little bit about inflammation today. And I know it's something [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=349.84s)]
*  that everybody knows what inflammation is. But inflammation isn't always a bad thing. How does [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  normal inflammation differ from chronic inflammation or inflammation that needs to be [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=359.88s)]
*  addressed? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So it's interesting, you know, back in the old days, which wasn't that long ago, I guess I'm [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=366.0s)]
*  getting older. But when I was a student, we were taught that chronic inflammation was just the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  failed resolution of acute inflammatory response. And acute inflammation, as you mentioned, is part [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=377.28s)]
*  of our innate immune system. And so when we have damage or infection or injury that happens in our [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  body, we have an inflammatory response. And especially with infection, the inflammatory [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=388.88s)]
*  response is really to identify bacterial viral invaders into our body to isolate that area and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=393.79999999999995s)]
*  to bring immune cells to fight the infection. When we have damage, you know, I think we've all [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=401.44s)]
*  experienced twisting our ankle or pulling a muscle or hurting ourselves in a way where we have an [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=406.76s)]
*  inflammatory response. What our body does is try to isolate the area of damage, because our body [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=412.12s)]
*  doesn't know whether something is going to spread and going to cause problems. And so what the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=418.4s)]
*  inflammatory response is trying to to identify a place of damage or infection to isolate that and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=423.44s)]
*  to bring immune cells into survey and say, what is this problem? And how can we fix it? And so, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=428.92s)]
*  obviously, that's important. And we don't want to eliminate that. In fact, if you completely [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=434.04s)]
*  eliminate your acute inflammatory response, you're going to be prone to getting infections and have [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=439.92s)]
*  other problems. And so what is really limited our ability to develop new strategies for chronic [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=445.44s)]
*  inflammation is really trying to understand the biology behind what's different about chronic [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=452.44s)]
*  inflammatory diseases versus acute inflammation. And just in the past few years, we've discovered [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=457.68s)]
*  a lot about how chronic inflammation happens. It's a little different process. There's a lot of the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=463.12s)]
*  same players involved, but how the process is regulated and how it gets initiated, we've [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=469.4s)]
*  discovered some things that are different. And so there's these big protein complex that I have a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  PhD in cell biology, I taught in major research universities and taught in medical schools. And, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=480.68s)]
*  you know, I never taught anybody about this big protein complex is called the inflammasomes. And [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  we now know that those protein complexes are involved in driving a lot of the pathology behind [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  chronic inflammatory diseases. I think the other thing we know now is chronic inflammation is a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=497.32s)]
*  driver in almost every chronic disease that you can think of. So rheumatoid arthritis, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=503.48s)]
*  ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, even neuroinflammation. I think we've started to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  realize how important inflammation is in the brain. I think from what I know, and what we've [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=514.24s)]
*  discovered, I don't think we can think of a positive role of chronic inflammation in the body. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=519.98s)]
*  It's clearly a pathological response and not a normal healthy response. And so really targeting [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=524.7s)]
*  chronic inflammation is a therapeutic strategy for targeting a lot of chronic diseases. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=532.62s)]
*  And can you tell me what NLRP3 inflammasome induced inflammation is? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=537.86s)]
*  So what we've discovered is that when the body receives a damage or infection response, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=545.06s)]
*  it has a way to turn on a protein complex. Well, actually, there's several of them. There's five [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=551.38s)]
*  inflammasomes that we know of. The one that's most well studied is called the NLRP3 inflammasome. And [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=557.9s)]
*  what it is, is a large protein complex. It's quite complicated how it's regulated. The RNA [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=564.7s)]
*  and the protein is made in response to an initial signal. And then the proteins kind of all sit [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=572.1s)]
*  there waiting for a second signal. So it has to have kind of an initial, we call it a priming [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=578.1s)]
*  signal where the machinery gets made and then it gets an inducing signal. So the body has to say, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=583.1s)]
*  hey, we think we have a problem. And then say, yeah, it looks like we really have a problem to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=588.7800000000001s)]
*  really assemble this protein complex. But it's a little complicated how it gets turned on. But [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=592.74s)]
*  once it gets turned on, it's a big machine. And its whole goal in life, its whole reason for [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=597.5s)]
*  existing is to produce these inflammatory pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=602.46s)]
*  cytokines. And the two cytokines it's most closely associated with is called IL-1 beta, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=608.7s)]
*  interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-18 or IL-18. So those two pro-inflammatory cytokines, the NLRP3 [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=615.06s)]
*  inflammasome catalytically activates those signaling molecules and is involved in releasing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=623.38s)]
*  them outside the cell. And so once they get released, they go signal to immune cells and say, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=629.26s)]
*  we think there's a problem here and recruit different types of immune cells to come to the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=634.98s)]
*  area where inflammation has been triggered. What we've discovered in chronic inflammation is the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=639.98s)]
*  activation of NLRP3 can actually happen in the absence of a damage or infection response. And [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=646.14s)]
*  so there's certain changes that can happen in cells that can activate this complex, even when [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=654.42s)]
*  there isn't a infection or damage response. And we think that that's the real driver, the very, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=659.86s)]
*  very most highest upstream signal in this whole cascade that gets turned on. And so when this [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=666.42s)]
*  complex is on, it's sending out signals say there's a problem, even when there's not. And [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=673.1s)]
*  what's bad about that is if you start recruiting your immune system to a place where the immune [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=677.82s)]
*  system is expecting to find a problem, when the immune system gets there and can't find it, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=683.38s)]
*  it creates one itself. And so I tell people, our immune system is our best friend until it's not. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=687.78s)]
*  You know, we're young and healthy, our immune system's helping there find infection and keeping [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=692.7s)]
*  us alive. As we get older, what we tend to find is our own immune system is actually our worst enemy [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=697.7s)]
*  sometimes and is actually literally trying to kill us. So it's this balance that happens and how that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=703.5s)]
*  gets out of whack is something that we've been trying to understand for years is, you know, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  how does something that's there, that's healthy, that's protective turn into something that can [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=714.1400000000001s)]
*  be a real challenge and a real driver of disease? You're targeting of Nek7, how does that inhibit [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=718.94s)]
*  an LRP3 and flamazome activity? Yeah, when we discovered this family that had this other mutation, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=726.0999999999999s)]
*  what we discovered is that that mutation was in a protein called Rab10. And Rab10 is a protein [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=732.8199999999999s)]
*  that sits in a machinery in our cells called the transgolgi apparatus or the Golgi apparatus. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=739.2199999999999s)]
*  And the Golgi apparatus, if you remember your basic biology, it's involved in helping to package [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=746.02s)]
*  and transport proteins to different places in the cell or outside the cell. And so NLRP3, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=751.5799999999999s)]
*  when it gets made, it gets transcribed, translated and packaged into these little vesicles inside the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=757.3s)]
*  cell. And then those vesicles get transported to a specific place inside the cell. And that place, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  interestingly, is called the microtubule organizing center of the cell. That's where it's most well [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=770.0999999999999s)]
*  known for being the place where the mitotic spindle forms. But interestingly, during other [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=776.02s)]
*  phases of the cell cycle that's not mitosis, the microtubule organizing center is actually a place [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=781.3s)]
*  of protein trafficking where proteins get transported down microtubules. And it turns out that's how [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=787.06s)]
*  the inflammasome gets assembled. So when we first discovered Rab10 being mutated, actually [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=793.06s)]
*  inhibited the ability of the NLRP3 inflammasome to be organized, we thought, well, let's just [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=799.54s)]
*  develop a Rab10 inhibitor because it should copy that. And what we discovered is Rab10 is very, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=805.62s)]
*  very hard to drug. It's a very challenging drug target. And so what we did is we looked upstream [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=811.38s)]
*  and downstream of Rab10 and said, can we find other proteins that do the same thing in the same [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=817.3s)]
*  pathway involved in the assembly of these protein complexes? And what we discovered is when we started [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=822.9s)]
*  to systematically, genetically knock down or knock out these proteins, what we discovered is [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=829.38s)]
*  a protein called NEC7, which is downstream of Rab10. When we knocked it out, we saw the exact same [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=834.9s)]
*  thing as if when we knocked out Rab10. And so what that meant to us is NEC7 could be a potential drug [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=840.9s)]
*  target. And we actually were able to develop a drug that inhibits the ability of NEC7 to bind [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=848.9s)]
*  to NLRP3. And when we do that, this whole big complex can't form. So we got excited about that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=854.66s)]
*  and said, wow, that's a brand new way that we could turn this thing off or we could block its [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=860.5s)]
*  activation. And even more exciting was an unexpected discovery that our drug could actually [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=864.74s)]
*  not only prevent the assembly of this complex, but it could actually promote the disassembly. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=871.4599999999999s)]
*  So once the complex is formed, we could bind the NEC7. And when we did that with our drug, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=877.14s)]
*  it made the whole complex fall apart. So we found a brand new strategy for turning off this big [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=881.62s)]
*  protein complex. And we've tested it now in every model that you can think of, of chronic inflammation. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=887.7s)]
*  And it works in the brain, it works in the lungs and the heart and the liver and the skin, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=895.38s)]
*  in the digestive system. And we really think that this is a new paradigm that we can use a new [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=899.94s)]
*  therapeutic approach for turning off chronic inflammatory signaling. And then our second drug, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=907.38s)]
*  we actually have that targets a protein that turns on RAB10. So when we block that, we basically have [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=912.74s)]
*  the same effect as knocking out or mutating RAB10. So we came up with two different ways, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=918.58s)]
*  and both of them seem to work. One of them, we're actually targeting in the brain, the one upstream [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=923.62s)]
*  of RAB10. And then the downstream with NEC7, we're looking at multiple different indications [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=928.66s)]
*  systemically everywhere else in the body. So what kind of conditions or diseases are related to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=934.98s)]
*  NLRP3 and flammosome activity? Yeah. So when it was first discovered NLRP3, if you have a genetic [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=942.1s)]
*  condition that's called prioporin-associated periodic syndrome, it's a very rare thing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=949.46s)]
*  And what they discovered is if you have a mutation in NLRP3, every time it gets cold, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=955.46s)]
*  which is interesting, when the temperature gets cold, you actually get a fever and a rash because [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=961.14s)]
*  you activate NLRP3 in your skin. So this particular mutation makes it's a temperature sensitive [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=966.26s)]
*  mutation. So when it gets cold, it actually triggers NLRP3 and causes a fever and a rash. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=971.86s)]
*  So we know that skin disorders are actually something that's very well studied, that when [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=977.22s)]
*  NLRP3 gets activated in your skin cells, it actually causes diseases like psoriasis and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=982.26s)]
*  atopic dermatitis and every rare skin disorder that you can think of. Really, I think NLRP3 has [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=987.7s)]
*  been associated with all of them. So that's kind of the first place people started to look at NLRP3 [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=993.94s)]
*  because it was associated with the genetics. But as we've studied it, we realized that NLRP3 is [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=999.22s)]
*  involved in cardiovascular disease. I think that that's kind of a new thought about cardiovascular [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1005.46s)]
*  diseases. It's not just about lipids and cholesterol accumulation, it's the immune response [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1012.1s)]
*  that sees that as a problem that actually triggers a lot of the cardiovascular deaths. So I think a [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1018.9s)]
*  lot of the movement in new targeting of cardiovascular diseases is all centered around chronic inflammation. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1024.9s)]
*  What we've shown is that if you lower your cholesterol but you don't lower inflammation, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1031.78s)]
*  it actually doesn't change your risk for having cardiovascular deaths like strokes and heart [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1037.06s)]
*  attacks. So inflammation is a real important driver and the most common cause of death in [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1041.94s)]
*  the world, which is cardiovascular disease. So I think that's an area that I think we're very [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1046.74s)]
*  interested and excited about. Inflammatory bowel disease in our gut, so ulcerative colitis and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1052.02s)]
*  Crohn's disease, those are chronic inflammatory disorders where NLRP3 is shown to be a really [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1058.02s)]
*  important driver. We're actually studying a pretty rare bone marrow condition called [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1063.54s)]
*  myelodysplastic syndrome. So if you get inflammation in your bone marrow, that doesn't sound good and [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1068.98s)]
*  it's not. If you get inflammation in your bone marrow, it actually stops your ability to make [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1075.1399999999999s)]
*  blood. Obviously, that's not a very positive thing for people. So you get terrible anemia, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1078.98s)]
*  you get pancidopenia, so you stop your ability to make not just red blood cells but white blood [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  cells and platelets and that's obviously terrible for these people. And the way we manage it early [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1090.66s)]
*  on, myelodysplastic syndrome, is we give people transfusions every week. So they have to come in [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1095.46s)]
*  and get blood all the time. We've been able to show that the driver of that disease is the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1100.1000000000001s)]
*  activation of NLRP3 and if you get rid of it, you can treat the anemia and the associated pancidopenia. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1104.5800000000002s)]
*  So we're doing a lot of work in that area. And the cool thing about the bone marrow is it's one of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1111.3000000000002s)]
*  the places where you can actually sample the actual disease. So I can't do that in the brain [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1116.66s)]
*  very easily, I can't do it in the heart very easily, can't do even in the gut, but I can do [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1121.3000000000002s)]
*  it in the bone marrow. And so that's one of the exciting things that why we started there as a [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1125.7s)]
*  company is we know that it's a driver in the bone marrow. In all of these cases that your diseases [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1129.6200000000001s)]
*  that you're mentioning, what does the reduction of the activity address? Yeah, if you can block [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1135.78s)]
*  NLRP3's assembly or its activation, what you do immediately is get rid of the cytokines IL-1 beta [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1143.14s)]
*  and IL-18. And if you get rid of those cytokines, you basically stop a big cascade of signaling that [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1151.3000000000002s)]
*  turns off the inflammatory of the immune response. So IL-1 beta will trigger the release of something [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1158.98s)]
*  called IL-6 and IL-6 is probably the most well known and well studied inflammatory cytokines. So [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1164.66s)]
*  IL-1 beta gets turned off, it'll turn off IL-6 and then TNF alpha, which is also a very well known [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1171.3s)]
*  downstream effector of inflammation. All of those things get turned off if you can turn off the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1176.8999999999999s)]
*  inflammasome. So what are drugs in the past? So for example, drugs like Humira, Humira has been one of [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1181.78s)]
*  the best selling drugs in the world for treating chronic inflammation in the gut, in the skin and [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1188.26s)]
*  other places. But the problem with that is that's just one of many signaling cascades that are [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1193.94s)]
*  involved in propagating the inflammatory response. When we turn off NLRP3, we turn off everything [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1200.5s)]
*  downstream. So all of the cascade, because it's at the very top, we turn off the driver, all the other [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1206.5s)]
*  stuff turns off. And so we think that it's a much more effective way to target chronic inflammatory [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1212.82s)]
*  signaling because we turn off the thing that's actually the main driver and not something that's [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1218.98s)]
*  just downstream. So even things like acetaminophen and ibuprofen, you buy it over the counter, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1223.86s)]
*  those drugs target inflammatory signaling molecules or chemicals that are produced [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1229.22s)]
*  by immune cells, but they're targeting it way downstream. And so they only block certain [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1235.94s)]
*  aspects of inflammation, not everything. And we think that blocking the very top is actually the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1242.26s)]
*  most effective way of turning that off. And what's interesting is we've discovered that when you do it [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1248.1000000000001s)]
*  that way, you don't have to take the drug every day, all day long, every day. You can actually do [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1254.02s)]
*  it in animals, at least. I can dose once a week and see just a good, if not better, effects on [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1260.02s)]
*  blocking the effects. Like for example, in the gut, in the digestive system, I can induce inflammation [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1266.5s)]
*  there and I can block with our drug just once a week. I can give it to the animals and the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1273.1399999999999s)]
*  inflammation goes away. And the cool thing about that is that we spare the acute inflammatory [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1278.26s)]
*  response doing it that way. That's been the challenges with blocking inflammation is how do [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1284.5800000000002s)]
*  you do it without causing immunosuppression where people can't have the normal healthy [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1289.8600000000001s)]
*  part of the inflammatory response. And we think we've come up with a way that we can do that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1296.1000000000001s)]
*  because the inflammasome, when it's on all the time, it's a driver of this pathology. And if we [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1300.42s)]
*  can just go and take those activated protein complexes and make them go away, we don't have [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1306.34s)]
*  to keep the pressure on 24-7 all the time. We can just intermittently dose and see a really profound [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1311.4599999999998s)]
*  effect on chronic inflammatory signaling. So I think it opens up a lot of possibilities of new ways [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1318.82s)]
*  to target this cascade by turning off the driver right at the very top. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1325.6999999999998s)]
*  In the news constantly is new treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. There are lots of [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1331.3799999999999s)]
*  different treatments being developed. Is reduction of inflammation being investigated by other [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1338.82s)]
*  companies other than what you're doing? Yeah, it's a relatively recent understanding. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1344.82s)]
*  I mean, we've always known that these diseases had inflammation as part of the disease. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1350.4199999999998s)]
*  But I think what we've started to realize is, for example, in Alzheimer's, a good example, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1354.82s)]
*  it's just widely accepted that Alzheimer's is caused by the accumulation of these protein [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1359.86s)]
*  complexes, these plaques that form in your brain of beta amyloid. And these beta amyloid plaques [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1364.34s)]
*  were thought to be the pathological drivers of the disease. So when you have plaques, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1370.8999999999999s)]
*  they affect brain function, which leads to degeneration of neurons and kill cells in the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1376.1799999999998s)]
*  brain, which leads to cognitive decline. And that's what the driver. What's interesting is [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1380.58s)]
*  we started to realize and get better imaging reagents so we can image plaques now in the [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1385.22s)]
*  brain. Just 10 years ago, we weren't very good at being able to do that. What we start to realize [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1390.5s)]
*  is that almost everybody over 80 years old has plaques in their brain, but not everybody has [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1395.94s)]
*  Alzheimer's. So when you ask the question, what's the difference between people with Alzheimer's [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1400.5s)]
*  and people that just have non-pathological beta amyloid, what the difference is, is the level [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1404.74s)]
*  of inflammation. So I think that's opened up a big, big understanding to say it's not just the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1410.18s)]
*  plaques, it's the recognition of that by the immune system to say, hey, we think we have a problem [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1416.42s)]
*  here that actually drives the disease. So if that's true, then what we should be able to do is to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1422.5800000000002s)]
*  intervene with anti-inflammatory drugs that could turn off. And what I think what we realize now is [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1429.46s)]
*  it's the inflammation, the activation, the brain kind of has a different immune system than the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1435.62s)]
*  rest of the body, but it has its own way of dealing with the inflammatory signals. And when you turn [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1440.18s)]
*  that pathway on the brain, it actually leads to destruction of neurons. And so the degeneration [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1445.78s)]
*  is actually tied to inflammation. And so if that's really what's driving the cognitive decline in [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1451.78s)]
*  people, then we should be able to intervene and to stop that. And that's exactly what we're trying [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1457.22s)]
*  to do. And what we're trying to do as a company is we're trying to replicate the human genetic [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1461.7s)]
*  experiment where we know there's people that have high risk based off their genetics to develop [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1467.38s)]
*  Alzheimer's. And now we have imaging and blood-based markers to show that we can treat people early [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1472.98s)]
*  with high risk genetics. We can watch what happens. And if they start to see signs where they have [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1479.6200000000001s)]
*  increase in these markers associated with neuro degeneration, we can intervene early and try to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1485.06s)]
*  reverse the course before we get, you know, it's very, very challenging to take late stage [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1490.82s)]
*  neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and try to reverse and fix something [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1496.5s)]
*  when you've basically caused a lot of damage in the brain. It's much better to prevent that from [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1501.86s)]
*  happening. And we think if we can identify high risk individuals and intervene early, we can block [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1507.54s)]
*  the degeneration by blocking this chronic inflammatory signaling. So we think that that's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1513.3s)]
*  the next generation. And when you look at all these drugs that have been developed recently, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1518.18s)]
*  and been approved recently for targeting beta amyloid, really what they hang their hat on is [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1523.22s)]
*  changing the rate of decline and not actually stopping the disease, but stopping how fast it's [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1528.8200000000002s)]
*  degenerating. And we think we can do better than that. And we think we have some tools now where [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1535.3s)]
*  we can identify genetically the right patients. We can intervene early and we can watch what's [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1541.22s)]
*  happening using imaging and blood-based biomarkers to show that we're actually reversing the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1546.5s)]
*  degeneration early and stopping the late stage of the disease, the later stages of the disease. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1552.66s)]
*  And, you know, my personal opinion is it's very, very challenging to think that we could intervene [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1558.34s)]
*  late in late stage Alzheimer's and actually reverse that damage that's been done. I think the best [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1564.58s)]
*  thing that we can do is try to identify, and it's what we've done like with heart disease, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1569.7s)]
*  we get on markers early, so everyone gets their cholesterol tested now, and you get identified [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1574.82s)]
*  early, you get put on therapeutic interventions that stop the disease at the very beginning. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1579.7s)]
*  And I think that that's what's going to happen moving forward. And so, yeah, I think that there's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1584.74s)]
*  a lot of people interested in this therapeutically. Right now, there's not any late stage clinical [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1589.22s)]
*  trials being done using neuroinflammatory targeted drugs, but there's early stage drugs, ours being [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1594.58s)]
*  one of them, that we think are going to have a big impact on these diseases in the future. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1600.26s)]
*  Dr. John B. Dixon speaking of which, could you tell me a bit more about your lead candidate, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  HT-6184, and how that works, and maybe some of the clinical trials that you're doing? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1609.7s)]
*  Dr. David Shieh Yeah, you bet. So, HT-6184 has actually been in two phase two clinical trials, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1614.98s)]
*  and we have a third one that we're starting here very soon. What we started was we tried to find [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1621.62s)]
*  indications where we could get a very fast signal to say this drug really does what we think it does. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1627.38s)]
*  And that's always the challenge with drug discovery. And it's one of the things as you're [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1633.0600000000002s)]
*  developing drugs is if you have to wait for two years to know whether your drug works or not, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1637.94s)]
*  that's really, really hard. Right? I mean, it's hard because I don't want to spend time and money [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1642.42s)]
*  and waste people's lives. You know, put people on a clinical trial and it's not working, and it takes [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1647.94s)]
*  you two years to figure that out. That's bad for everybody. So, we tried to find places where we [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1652.26s)]
*  could get a readout very, very quickly. And so, we went to places where we knew that we could measure [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1657.46s)]
*  things associated with inflammation very quickly and see whether the drug had biological activity. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1664.5s)]
*  So, we can study in the lab. We know it looks great in the lab, but translating from the lab [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1672.02s)]
*  into people has always been the big challenge because everything looks good in the lab. We [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1676.02s)]
*  don't take any drugs forward that don't look good in the lab. So, everything looks good in the [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1679.94s)]
*  laboratory. When you get into real people is when things fall apart. So, we wanted to start in places [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1683.78s)]
*  where we could get a fast signal. And so, we started with myelodysplastic syndrome, which is [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1689.3s)]
*  inflammation of the bone marrow. And the great thing about that is we know it's a main driver [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1694.02s)]
*  of the disease. It's been well, well studied. And so, we know that the activation of this pathway, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1698.74s)]
*  NLRP3, and thereby NEC7, which is what our drug does, it binds the NEC7, which is part of the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1704.18s)]
*  NLRP3 inflammasome, that we knew that that was important. And we had great ways of measuring [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1710.8200000000002s)]
*  activity. So, if the inflammation is blocking hematopoiesis or the production of blood, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1716.5s)]
*  then blocking inflammation should restore hematopoiesis. And so, that's the easiest thing. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1721.7s)]
*  We can just measure, you draw blood and watch what happens to hemoglobin and what happens to [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1725.7s)]
*  red blood cell production. And that's super easy and it's very inexpensive to do. So, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1730.74s)]
*  as a little company, those are exactly what we're looking for. Is there a place where we can see a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1735.86s)]
*  signal quickly? We've treated about 30 people in the phase two clinical trial with our drug. And [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1740.34s)]
*  all they're doing is, by the way, I don't think I've mentioned this, it's just an oral pill. So, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1745.38s)]
*  it's just a little pill you take every day. Right now, for MDS patients, we're treating them [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1749.3s)]
*  continuously for four months. So, at baseline, we take their bone marrow and then [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1754.9s)]
*  intermittently through their treatment, we can watch what happens. And we're obviously [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1761.14s)]
*  constantly watching as they come into the clinic, we can draw blood and watch what's happening to [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1765.22s)]
*  their hemoglobin levels. The clinical trial is scheduled for about 40 individuals. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1770.5800000000002s)]
*  And the primary endpoint is just to see whether we can induce responses in these people. And [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1776.02s)]
*  responses are measured by how well we can turn on their hematopoiesis, how well we can restore [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1781.7s)]
*  normal blood production. And so, we will be reporting the preliminary analysis of this. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1787.78s)]
*  We treated 25 people, we did a preliminary analysis, and then we enrolled the remaining 15 [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1795.3s)]
*  people. And so, we're just getting that wrapped up now. We think we should have all 40 people [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1800.66s)]
*  completed by the end of this year. There's a big hematology meeting at the end of the year that [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1806.18s)]
*  we've submitted to present the results of that study. But I can just tell you that we feel like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1811.3s)]
*  there's a promising signal there. So, we think that there's early data that suggests the drug [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1816.34s)]
*  is doing what we expect it to. And we can measure those inflammatory proteins in the blood as well. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1821.1399999999999s)]
*  And so, we can watch at baseline, they have high inflammation over time, we can watch the inflammation [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1827.3s)]
*  go down. And so, we're going to show all of that data. But early look, it's not a blinded study. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1832.4199999999998s)]
*  So, we can watch what's happening in real time. We feel pretty encouraged by what we're seeing [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1838.1s)]
*  right now. And we have completed a randomized blinded study. And it was kind of an unusual [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1842.6599999999999s)]
*  study, but it's something that we did very, very quickly. We took people that were undergoing a [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1849.2199999999998s)]
*  surgery. It was actually an oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction. So, when you pull your tooth out, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1854.26s)]
*  you cause a very strong inflammatory signal response. And post-surgical inflammation is [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1860.6599999999999s)]
*  something that's a real problem. We don't have great drugs to manage inflammation after surgery. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1867.62s)]
*  And so, it's something we were interested in. And one of the main drivers of pain is inflammation. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1873.86s)]
*  And so, we know that one of the big challenges in our world right now is we don't like giving [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1879.9399999999998s)]
*  people opioids after they have surgery, because we know a good percentage of people actually become [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1884.58s)]
*  dependent and addicted to opioids. And so, there's a big push to get rid of that. And there's been a [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1890.34s)]
*  big challenge finding new ways to address pain. And so, we said, well, what if we could actually [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1895.78s)]
*  get rid of the inflammation? That should have an impact on pain. So, just in a couple weeks, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1900.5s)]
*  I'm going to be presenting an oral presentation at a conference in Boston. But we're going to show [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1905.46s)]
*  the results of that study. We've already signaled and let people know that we think that there's a [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1910.66s)]
*  very positive signal from that study where we conducted a blinded placebo-controlled trial, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1915.46s)]
*  where people either got placebo or are drug right before they had the surgery. And then we watched [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1921.14s)]
*  what happened. And we measured how much inflammation they had, how much pain that they had. And we [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1926.1000000000001s)]
*  watched how that was correlated with the levels of the drug in people. And so, I can tell you once [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1932.42s)]
*  again, we think there's a very, very positive signal that came out of that study. So, that gives [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1938.8200000000002s)]
*  us a strong indication the drug actually does what we think it does. And so, now we're moving [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1943.3000000000002s)]
*  into other areas. We're very interested in arthritis, both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1948.1s)]
*  arthritis, very common disorders. I think all of us, as we get older, can have experience with some [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1953.9399999999998s)]
*  level of arthritis. We think that this is a really interesting new way of targeting inflammation with [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1960.4199999999998s)]
*  arthritis. And we've got great data in the lab to show that it works very well in animal models. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1966.8999999999999s)]
*  And then the other area that we're very excited about is the inflammation associated with obesity [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1971.9399999999998s)]
*  and you obviously everyone in our world knows that obesity and weight loss is kind of the hottest [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1977.94s)]
*  thing right now. The Osmotic and Monjaro and these drugs that have really revolutionized [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1983.78s)]
*  the ability to trigger weight loss in obese patients and certainly in type 2 diabetic patients. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1990.1000000000001s)]
*  What we're seeing is there's actually a really important role of inflammation in adipose tissue. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=1996.02s)]
*  And we have a brand new concept of how we can combine our drug with these GLP-1 agonists, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2002.98s)]
*  these new weight loss drugs and see pretty amazing results. So, we're actually very excited to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2010.58s)]
*  translate that into a clinical trial quickly. And we think that this has a lot of potential [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2016.26s)]
*  for not just triggering weight loss, but all the related diseases around obesity, which we think [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2021.9399999999998s)]
*  obviously almost everything that we study, arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease and [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2028.18s)]
*  cardiovascular, all of that is exacerbated by obesity. And so, I think that we're definitely [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2033.22s)]
*  jumping on that train right now to look at the component of inflammation in adipose tissue as [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2038.66s)]
*  people have that condition. So, we should be announcing very soon additional clinical studies [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2045.46s)]
*  around both arthritis and obesity. This might sound like a really stupid question, but in terms [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2051.86s)]
*  of inflammation, obviously, sometimes inflammation can be a good thing because it's a protective [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2057.54s)]
*  mechanism. If you're treating somebody and reducing inflammation, what happens if, for instance, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2062.42s)]
*  somebody that's on your drug turns their ankle? Does inflammation not happen? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2069.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. And the answer would be they probably have less inflammation, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2075.46s)]
*  for sure, if they're on our drugs. So, it's one of those things that inflammation is a very [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2079.86s)]
*  finely tuned, too much is bad, too little is bad. So, there's kind of this Goldilocks, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2085.46s)]
*  it has to be just right. Our body's normal response, and especially as we get older, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2091.38s)]
*  and we're starting to realize why that is, a lot of our inflammatory response is primed by [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2096.98s)]
*  damage signals. And as we get older, we just have damage all the time. You wake up in the morning, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2103.86s)]
*  it's like, oh man, I feel you could hurt yourself sleeping sometimes as you get older. And so, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2108.18s)]
*  we think that there's actually an opportunity to lower that. And you don't want to completely [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2114.66s)]
*  knock it out because, as you mentioned, there's a healthy component to it. And so, we think that [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2120.8199999999997s)]
*  there's a way to eliminate kind of the normal background inflammation that's associated with [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2125.62s)]
*  aging. And that's another area that we're very interested in is longevity is kind of a new thing [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2132.18s)]
*  that I think people are starting to realize that one of the biggest challenges in our world right [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2136.98s)]
*  now is we have an aging population, and there aren't more babies coming, right? I mean, our [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2142.42s)]
*  birth rates have dropped so dramatically that we've got to keep people healthier longer. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2147.14s)]
*  And one of the ways to do that is, what if we could dose and either dose once a week or dose [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2152.5s)]
*  at very low doses to get rid of all this background inflammation and not turn off the acute inflammatory [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2158.42s)]
*  response when you need it, but to get rid of the background stuff, we call it kind of the slow [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2166.26s)]
*  burn. Inflammations associated has flame in the name, right? So, the burn associated with inflammation, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2170.82s)]
*  you get rid of the slow burn and spare the ability of the body when it needs to respond quickly. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2176.5800000000004s)]
*  And we think that our drug actually might represent exactly that, that we could lower [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2183.6200000000003s)]
*  that, kind of get into that Goldilocks level where we make it so inflammation is not too hot [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2188.82s)]
*  or too cold, but it's just right and help people feel healthier longer. There's an X-Prize that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2194.7400000000002s)]
*  is out there for a new concepts and trying to keep people healthier, increase our health span [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2200.74s)]
*  as we get older. And we're putting together a team to compete for that prize where we think [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2206.8199999999997s)]
*  that if we can eliminate kind of that background, slow burn of inflammation as we get older, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2211.7799999999997s)]
*  that could be a really interesting way to keep people healthy for a longer period of time. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2217.7s)]
*  And is the key to that early intervention? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2222.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. So not waiting for the full blown diseases, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2225.94s)]
*  but try to intervene early and say, let's not go crazy and give big doses, you know, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2230.42s)]
*  because I think as a drug developer, that's always been kind of how we wait for the disease. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2235.6200000000003s)]
*  And then we go after it with both barrels, right? We give it big, big doses of these drugs. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2240.1800000000003s)]
*  What if we gave very low doses over long periods of time and just got rid of, like you said, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2244.9s)]
*  intervene early before it builds up to something that becomes a real problem and delay the onset [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2249.7000000000003s)]
*  of some of these age associated chronic diseases? Do you know that almost everybody over 65 has at [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2255.22s)]
*  least one chronic disease? You know, think about that, you know, in the number of people over 65 [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2261.2999999999997s)]
*  is exponentially growing right now in our population. So almost everybody over 65 has at [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2266.8199999999997s)]
*  least one chronic disease. And in fact, most of them have two or more. So I think 80% of people [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2272.1s)]
*  over 65 have at least two chronic diseases. If we could push that out. So instead of at 65, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2277.54s)]
*  maybe that's at 70, those statistics, just think what that could do to the world. I mean, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2283.3s)]
*  it could really, really change not just individually, but our whole economy. Keep [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2287.86s)]
*  people working a little longer. We could keep people healthier longer and being actively [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2292.98s)]
*  producing and not spending money on healthcare. Because honestly, that's not healthcare, right? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2298.02s)]
*  Are the last five years of people's lives is where they spend most of their most of their money around [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2303.54s)]
*  medical treatments. And we could push that out. I think that that that would be the biggest impact [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2308.5s)]
*  that we could have. Is it something then that you anticipate that you would take your product [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2313.94s)]
*  in the same way as you would take a vitamin like as preventative and you start taking it at 40? Or [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2320.42s)]
*  would it rely upon being diagnosed or having a predisposition to a certain condition before [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2327.38s)]
*  you take it? That's a great question. And obviously, the regulatory side of things, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2334.34s)]
*  how you get the drug approved is really important. I think initially, we would probably [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2338.7400000000002s)]
*  be working with the FDA and EMA and other, you know, around the world. There's an appetite now [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2344.1800000000003s)]
*  on the regulatory side to say, in the past, preventative type of trials have been very, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2350.02s)]
*  very challenging because it's like, well, I've got to wait for 15 years to see whether, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2355.2200000000003s)]
*  whether I actually change things. And so, you know, we've got to come up with new, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2359.6200000000003s)]
*  new ideas of ways that we can actually intervene early in preventing the trajectory of developing [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2363.14s)]
*  diseases. So typically what we try to do is like cholesterol lowering drugs is a great example. So, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2369.14s)]
*  you know, we could measure cholesterol for years before we had statins, you know, which have been [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2375.3799999999997s)]
*  very successful drugs and managing the levels of cholesterol in people and therefore having an [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2380.74s)]
*  impact on the survival of people with cardiovascular disease. And so you think about that and say, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2386.66s)]
*  maybe there's a way and it's not far-fetched because we actually have the tools now to, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2393.06s)]
*  you know, take people at 50 years old and say, okay, you're going to get a yearly physical from [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2399.8599999999997s)]
*  now on. And part of that blood test, in fact, if you look at your blood test that you get when you [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2403.8599999999997s)]
*  have your physical, one of the things they measure is a protein called C-reactive protein or CRP. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2409.06s)]
*  What CRP is actually measuring is your level of inflammation. So it's a surrogate for inflammation. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2415.22s)]
*  It's been well, well studied in the context of cardiovascular inflammation. That's why it's [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2421.78s)]
*  included in our blood panels. But we think that using CRP as a surrogate for systemic inflammation [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2426.5800000000004s)]
*  might be something the FDA would be okay with is say, we're going to take people that have high CRP [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2433.38s)]
*  and we know what that is and we're going to try to lower their CRP. And I think that there's a [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2438.98s)]
*  big enough body of literature and understanding in the scientific community that if I can take [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2445.1400000000003s)]
*  people that have CRP levels of three or higher, that's considered to be at risk people. If you [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2449.62s)]
*  have CRP higher than three, you have something going on in your body that's causing a high [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2455.14s)]
*  enough inflammatory response, your risk for mortality associated with cardiovascular disease [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2461.14s)]
*  and other things is actually goes up. And so we can take that and drive that down. It's very much [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2466.02s)]
*  like cholesterol that we can measure something early. It's not heart disease, it's measuring [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2471.06s)]
*  cholesterol. But we know cholesterol is associated with heart disease. So we can lower that. We can [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2475.62s)]
*  have an impact in the future. So those are the kinds of things we're thinking about is [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2480.18s)]
*  can we take people that we know are at risk, but otherwise feel pretty healthy? I mean, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2484.1s)]
*  most people that have a CRP of three don't really know they do until they have a physical, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2488.9s)]
*  but then we can have something we can intervene and say, let's lower that inflammation. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2493.46s)]
*  Let's take it from a higher level and get it down to normal. And is that enough to actually get a [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2497.7s)]
*  drug approved? Right now, that's an unanswered question because nobody's tried it. But those are [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2503.54s)]
*  the types of things we're thinking about is can we take high risk people with a measurable marker [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2508.02s)]
*  and lower that marker and get an early approval that we don't have to wait for 15 years to show [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2513.7799999999997s)]
*  what the impact is on all of these chronic diseases. But that's exactly the idea. Think about [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2519.46s)]
*  what we did with statins and how widely used statins are. Millions and millions of people, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2524.9s)]
*  hundreds of millions of people take statins around the world. And so we think that that's [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2530.34s)]
*  kind of the path to follow and to look at moving forward. I'm pretty sure that everyone has [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2535.06s)]
*  experienced inflammation in some capacity. So interesting to learn more about it and its [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2545.54s)]
*  connection to a whole host of diseases. And more importantly, how to combat it to tackle some of [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2552.26s)]
*  those diseases. Don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at lebiotech.eu [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3AhJTHrCI&t=2559.78s)]
