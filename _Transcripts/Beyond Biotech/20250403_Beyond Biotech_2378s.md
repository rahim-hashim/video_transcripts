# Meeting the global demand for cell therapies: scaling with smart manufacturing
**Beyond Biotech:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dylan Cassane and this is episode 142 for the podcast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  This week I had the chance to talk to Fabian Gerlinghaus, co-founder and CEO of Solaris. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=16.92s)]
*  Solaris is on the cutting edge when it comes to manufacturing cells for therapeutics and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=23.64s)]
*  their cell shuttle and smart factory technologies are helping top pharma companies and biotech [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=28.36s)]
*  innovators get cells to patients faster than ever. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  I hope you enjoy this chat with Fabian, where we dive into everything from how his background [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=37.56s)]
*  in aeronautical engineering helped him identify bottlenecks in bio manufacturing to how cell [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=42.0s)]
*  manufacturers are using robotics to drive up both quality and yield. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=47.2s)]
*  Fabian, welcome to Beyond Biotech. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=53.72s)]
*  You didn't actually start off working in biotech, right? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=57.64s)]
*  You trained as an aerospace engineer over in Munich and then sort of made the transition [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=60.48s)]
*  to biotech. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=67.36s)]
*  What took you from aerospace into the world of biotech? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=68.36s)]
*  Yeah, Dylan, that's right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=70.92s)]
*  I'm an aerospace engineer, nearby training, turned life science tools, inventor, turned [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=73.08s)]
*  entrepreneur and businessman. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=77.0s)]
*  I have always known I wanted to start a company and I've always been fascinated with technology. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=79.12s)]
*  And ultimately, starting a company in the life sciences, producing life saving medicines [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=86.08s)]
*  is extremely purposeful work. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=92.56s)]
*  And that's what motivated the change. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=94.84s)]
*  And you talk about this purpose there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=98.16s)]
*  Was there a particular moment when you decided, yeah, I'm going to start my company in this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  domain rather than something else, something else in the entrepreneurial space? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=104.82s)]
*  I think it's always a combination of having an intention. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=110.3s)]
*  My intention was certainly to make a positive contribution to the world and then also finding [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=114.1s)]
*  a big, meaningful and unsolved problem. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=118.94s)]
*  And I happened to find I happened to stumble across a very meaningful big problem in 2017, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=121.86s)]
*  2018, attending a lot of cell therapy conferences. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=129.26s)]
*  Scientists at these conferences were shouting from the rooftops, we've got cures for cancer [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=133.9s)]
*  and we have no way of manufacturing these living cell therapies that can cure cancer [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=139.3s)]
*  at commercial scale and in a cost efficient way. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=145.62s)]
*  So that was kind of the watershed moment where I understood, oh, this is a big, meaningful [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=149.58s)]
*  problem and here's an opportunity to develop the right technology to save the lives of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  millions of people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=162.18s)]
*  So I guess that was where Solaris came from. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=164.06s)]
*  But Solaris wasn't the first entrepreneurial activity for you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=166.9s)]
*  You were a chief innovation officer before, was it at Sintego? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=171.02s)]
*  Or co-invented RNA synthesizer technology there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=176.1s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about that experience and how maybe you took something from there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=179.18s)]
*  and brought it over to Solaris? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=183.74s)]
*  I learned a lot from being at Sintego. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=188.22s)]
*  I joined when we were five people in the garage. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  I helped grow the company from five people to 240 people over five and a half years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=193.3s)]
*  So I learned a lot about company building and co-invented Sintego's RNA synthesizer [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=198.58s)]
*  technology that started up a new research department that was working on tools and technologies [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=204.02s)]
*  for traditional bioprocessing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=208.58s)]
*  How do you make monoclonal antibodies faster, better, cheaper, that kind of a thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=210.78s)]
*  And learned a lot about inventing bioprocessing technologies, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=214.62s)]
*  architecting bioprocessing technologies, recruiting, team building, company building. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  So I will say that the years at Sintego were my dojo, where I went to train and learn. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  And ultimately, those years really prepared me for starting Solaris. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=234.9s)]
*  And of course, you can bring that experience in building teams there if you're building [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=238.78s)]
*  from five people to more than 200. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=242.66s)]
*  You can bring that to Solaris. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=245.06s)]
*  Are you able to apply those sort of lessons? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  Is that a daily thing for you there? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=248.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=250.5s)]
*  Many, many, many lessons. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=251.38s)]
*  I think from the very beginning, we had a dogged determination to hire the best of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  best in all the respective industries and fields. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=260.34s)]
*  Solaris is an incredibly multidisciplinary company. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=266.1s)]
*  There's five different engineering disciplines, many cell therapy scientists. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=268.54s)]
*  There's so many different teams and disciplines working together on the one roof. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=272.78s)]
*  So finding the best talent, the top five to 10 percentile within each craft and discipline [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=277.86s)]
*  was absolutely key. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=283.74s)]
*  The other key thing was having a strong set of values and being very intentional about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=285.62s)]
*  corporate company culture from the very, very beginning. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=294.58s)]
*  And I think one key value that we've been emphasizing from the beginning is collaboration. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=297.62s)]
*  A lot of the power of Solaris comes from the fact that we've got all of these different [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=304.86s)]
*  disciplines working together that are normally siloed away in different departments, in different [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=308.46s)]
*  companies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=314.22s)]
*  And at Solaris, all of these different disciplines are working together closely under the same [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=315.22s)]
*  roof and collaboration, communication is key. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=321.06s)]
*  You talk about collaboration, but Solaris itself is a collaboration. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=325.70000000000005s)]
*  You had a couple of co-founders come together with you to launch this company, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=332.74s)]
*  I started the company with Omar Khoury, my co-founder and president. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=334.1s)]
*  Omar ran a 200 million dollar business unit at Thermo Fisher Scientific, making certified [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=339.18s)]
*  medical devices, mass spectrometers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=345.70000000000005s)]
*  Then he ran operations at Finesse. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  Finesse was making 2,000 liters single-use bioreactors for pretty much every pharma company [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=350.26000000000005s)]
*  in the industry until they got bought by Thermo Fisher. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=355.58s)]
*  And then Omar ran operations at Synthigo. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=358.9s)]
*  So I was the R&D leader at Synthigo and Omar was the operations leader. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=361.58s)]
*  So many, many nights where we worked oftentimes until 5 a.m. in the morning together. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=366.58s)]
*  And you get to learn a lot about somebody else. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=372.78s)]
*  You get to build a lot of trust if you work such long hours together. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=376.38s)]
*  So Omar and I get to know each other at Synthigo and so built a lot of, built a very strong [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=382.06s)]
*  relationship, a lot of trust, a lot of love. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=387.7s)]
*  And you've come, you've come all together then into this world of cell therapies. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=390.66s)]
*  I want to understand a little bit about the problem that you're solving here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=395.14s)]
*  In one time, one way we talk about cell therapy is being living drugs with this huge potential. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=399.18s)]
*  You talked about curing cancers and addressing problems in oncology there, but yet patients [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=404.5s)]
*  are still waiting for them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=410.22s)]
*  It's really hard to do at scale manufacturing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=411.38s)]
*  Where are the bottlenecks? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=414.54s)]
*  What are the sorts of things you're addressing with Solaris? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=415.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=419.34s)]
*  So cell therapy is our, cell therapy is a personalized medicine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=420.18s)]
*  So every dose is manufactured for each patient individually. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=427.18s)]
*  And today this is done with manual methods, bench-tip equipment that handle one unit operation [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=430.94s)]
*  for one patient at a time and tons and tons of manual labor. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=436.82s)]
*  So this is what makes cell therapies so expensive and impossible to manufacture at commercial [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=440.3s)]
*  scale in the tens and hundreds of thousands of patient doses per year. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=448.62s)]
*  And I guess when I was looking over your materials and looking over your website, some of the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=453.3s)]
*  things that kept coming up were your problems of scale, problems of cost. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=457.5s)]
*  Like you say, it's incredibly expensive reliability when you're actually manufacturing those cells. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=462.14s)]
*  Is there one of these that stands out as the biggest problem or the biggest bottleneck [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=469.58s)]
*  to actually making this a more mainstream therapy? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=473.46s)]
*  I will say the two biggest challenges are related and equally important. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=481.58s)]
*  And if you solve one, you kind of solve the other. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=486.1s)]
*  Cell-themed manufacturing in its current form is unscalable and it's not cost efficient. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=488.94s)]
*  So we really need to solve both of these problems to make cell therapy sustainable as an industry [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=493.1s)]
*  in the long run. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=498.38s)]
*  And your solution, this is the cell shuttle. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=499.98s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about that and introduce exactly what it is and how it works? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=502.9s)]
*  Yeah, the cell shuttle fully automates the entire cell-themed manufacturing process [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=507.62s)]
*  from start to finish. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  So where other instruments on the market handle one or two of the manufacturing steps, the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=513.9s)]
*  cell shuttle actually handles all of the manufacturing steps. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  So it's a big step forward in terms of the degree of automation. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=521.22s)]
*  That's one dimension here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=524.38s)]
*  The second dimension is the cell shuttle handles 16 patient doses being manufactured concurrently [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=528.18s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=535.78s)]
*  And that is 16 times higher throughput than any other instrument on the market. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=536.78s)]
*  All the instruments on the market today handle one patient at a time. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=541.86s)]
*  And the cell shuttle handles 16 times more. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=545.38s)]
*  So a big step forward in terms of the degree of automation, a big step forward in terms [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=548.9s)]
*  of the throughput, the parallelism, and both of these things together give us a very, very [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=553.14s)]
*  scalable platform that allows us to produce 10 times more cell therapies with the same [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=558.18s)]
*  number of employees and the same facility size at about half the price. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=563.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=568.98s)]
*  I mean, this is great for the pharma companies that you're working with, the healthcare [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=569.98s)]
*  industry, the biopharma industry as well. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=575.14s)]
*  But it's also really good for patients. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=578.1s)]
*  I mean, you should be able to see wait lists. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=579.38s)]
*  Are we expecting them to move 16 times faster? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=581.38s)]
*  I would say we're... [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=585.66s)]
*  How do I answer this? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=588.8199999999999s)]
*  The technology that we're building is going to put us into a position to meet the total [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=592.22s)]
*  patient demand for cell therapies globally. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=597.02s)]
*  So where today we see patients dying on the wait list. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=599.86s)]
*  So STAT actually wrote an article about this a few years ago. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=603.74s)]
*  They wrote about the CAR T patient treatment crisis where patients are dying on the wait [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=608.0999999999999s)]
*  list, even though they're eligible for FDA approved cell therapies that are on the market. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=615.14s)]
*  And the oncologists at the treatment centers get a certain number of manufacturing slots [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=619.3s)]
*  assigned to them. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  They have more patients than that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  And then it's up to the oncologists to decide who gets to live and who gets to die. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is what our advisor and cell therapy pioneer Professor Dr. Carl June from the University [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=633.78s)]
*  of Pennsylvania has called a medical emergency. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=640.22s)]
*  And what the throughput of the cell shuttle and the high degree of automation of our manufacturing [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  platforms allow us to do is ultimately meet the total patient demand for cell therapies [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=649.52s)]
*  globally so that we can meet the entire patient demand and make it so that no patient has [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  to die on a wait list. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=660.98s)]
*  You said as well, it's also a cost saving or a big cost saving there as well. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=664.38s)]
*  What is it specifically that makes the cost so much more affordable with the cell shuttle? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  If you think about the primary drivers of cost in cell type manufacturing, it's labor [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=676.94s)]
*  and facilities overhead followed by materials. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=683.82s)]
*  And we have not just the cell shuttle, we also have the cell queue. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=688.3000000000001s)]
*  The cell shuttle automates manufacturing, the cell queue automates quality control. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=691.94s)]
*  In my book, both of these technologies are equally important. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=697.1s)]
*  You really need to have high throughput through the entire drug manufacturing pipeline. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=700.7800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't serve you if you just have high throughput in upstream manufacturing, but [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  then you bottleneck with manual labor and downstream quality control. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=708.0200000000001s)]
*  Both of these technologies together reduce labor by about 90 percent. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=711.82s)]
*  So we can produce the same number of cell therapies with 10 percent of the people or [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=716.12s)]
*  put differently with the same number of employees, we can produce 10 times more cell therapies. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=721.64s)]
*  At the same time, a 90 percent reduction in the number of employees leads to dramatic [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=726.6s)]
*  cost savings. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=731.26s)]
*  And on the second side of the equation, both of these technologies are very compact. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=733.08s)]
*  The cell shuttle is a big machine. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=741.88s)]
*  It's roughly the size of a big conference room, about nine feet tall, but it is functionally [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=743.56s)]
*  equivalent to about a hundred benchtop instruments. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=748.96s)]
*  Put a hundred benchtop instruments on a hundred benches with enough space for human operators [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=753.0799999999999s)]
*  to walk around and operate these machines, and you're going to take up 10 times more [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=757.74s)]
*  facility space. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=761.38s)]
*  This is what allows us to produce 10 times more cell therapies with the same amount of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=764.1999999999999s)]
*  facility space. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=768.96s)]
*  So where would take other companies 20 facilities, each the size of four football fields to produce [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=770.16s)]
*  150,000 patient doses per year? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  We bring that down from 20 facilities to two facilities. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=783.48s)]
*  That reduces the capex from billions and billions and billions of dollars into the hundreds [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=787.4s)]
*  of millions of dollars. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=791.4399999999999s)]
*  That ultimately reduces cost. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=792.92s)]
*  To put it succinctly, cell shuttle technology and cell Q technologies, both of these platforms [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  together reduce the number of employees we need by 90 percent and the facility space [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=801.86s)]
*  that we need by 90 percent. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=805.7800000000001s)]
*  That impacts both scalability and also allows us to reduce the batch price by about 50 percent [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=807.94s)]
*  compared to what conventional CDMOs would be charging. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=814.7800000000001s)]
*  That's great for pharma companies. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=820.34s)]
*  That's certainly going to make it a more sustainable therapy for them to be investing in for their [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=821.98s)]
*  capital expenditure. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=826.54s)]
*  What about for patients? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=828.24s)]
*  Can we expect that the end price for the therapies is also going to reduce thanks to a technology [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=829.58s)]
*  like this? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=835.98s)]
*  I will say this isn't really up to Solaris, right? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=836.98s)]
*  We're helping the pharma companies manufacture for a lower price point. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=841.94s)]
*  And then long term, it's a negotiation between the pharma companies and the payers, the insurances [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=845.9s)]
*  to align on the ultimate price point of the actual cell therapy that insurers are reimbursing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=851.5799999999999s)]
*  I think much like any technology, over the coming decades, the price points are going to come down. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  I think it's going to be similar as the development of cell phones. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=868.5799999999999s)]
*  Early on, cell phones were prohibitively expensive and only the very rich had a cell phone in [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=875.6600000000001s)]
*  their high end luxury car. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=882.6600000000001s)]
*  Over time, cell phones became democratized where today cell phones are accessible and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=885.6600000000001s)]
*  affordable for everyone. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=892.4200000000001s)]
*  I guess beyond costs and certainly when it comes to the cost to the patient, that is [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=894.74s)]
*  something that's out of your hands. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=899.22s)]
*  But besides the cost, there are other ways that the cell shuttler is making a difference [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=901.46s)]
*  when it comes to contamination, when it comes to operator error, human error involved in [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=906.46s)]
*  the manufacturing process. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=911.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a way to avoid some of that as well, right? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=913.38s)]
*  What we're seeing in the industry today are process failure rates that are sky high. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=915.86s)]
*  We're hearing about process failure rates up to 30, 40% in some cases. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=921.0600000000001s)]
*  And how are you going to run a business? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=926.22s)]
*  You've got a process failure rate of 30 to 40%. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=929.18s)]
*  If you do an analysis of the primary sources of process failures, it really comes down [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=935.5s)]
*  to contamination and operator error. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=941.18s)]
*  Operator error, we're mitigating through fully automating the entire process. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=946.3s)]
*  Contamination, we're mitigating by fully closing the process. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=951.26s)]
*  The key innovation that Solaris came up with is a fully closed consumable cartridge that [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=956.58s)]
*  is effectively five different technologies in one. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=964.7s)]
*  Sanifuge, magnetic cell solar, electro-parator, biorector, and sterile transfer technology. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=968.0200000000001s)]
*  All of these technologies are normally bench top equipment made by different vendors and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=973.7s)]
*  then operated individually by a lot of human operators. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=979.14s)]
*  What we've done at Solaris is we've built a cartridge that is fully integrated, contains [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=983.62s)]
*  all of the manufacturing technologies that are required to run the entire self-manufacturing [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=989.06s)]
*  process in a fully automated fashion in the closed tubing set. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=994.1s)]
*  So there's no open transfers of the patient cells required from one instrument to the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=997.78s)]
*  other instrument. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1003.74s)]
*  Those are the steps where typically you're vulnerable to contamination. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1006.06s)]
*  We've done an analysis and predict that we'll be reducing process failure rates by about [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1011.34s)]
*  75% through these two things, mitigating operator error through automation and mitigating process [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1017.7s)]
*  failure due to contamination by fully closing the process. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1024.46s)]
*  This platform that you've built, it's not the only automated platform out there. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1034.18s)]
*  I think Sartorius has one as well. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1039.26s)]
*  What differentiates you? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1041.94s)]
*  Is it the fact that it's working on 16 at once instead of just one? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1043.34s)]
*  Is it the fact that it's all in one? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1048.32s)]
*  Is there a quality control measure in there that sets you apart? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1049.84s)]
*  The throughput is the primary differentiating factor. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1055.62s)]
*  The ability to run 16 times more cell therapies in parallel on the same instrument. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1058.54s)]
*  The other differentiating factor is the degree to which we've automated the manufacturing [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1064.36s)]
*  process. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1068.84s)]
*  The vast majority of other cell therapy manufacturing equipment vendors out there are building bench [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1070.3799999999999s)]
*  top equipment that handles one or two, maybe three unit operations, but they're not actually [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1077.58s)]
*  automating the entire process. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1084.1s)]
*  A lot of them claim end-to-end automation, but then if you look under the hood, there's [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1086.02s)]
*  usually a few unit operations missing that we've automated on the cell shell. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1090.24s)]
*  You mentioned just before about this total patient demand globally and being able to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1096.44s)]
*  address that total patient demand. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1100.6200000000001s)]
*  What does it actually look like in terms of success for Solaris in the years, the decades [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1103.5s)]
*  ahead in terms of the lives impacted? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1107.9s)]
*  I recall as well, right at the beginning, you said you wanted to have this impact on [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1111.1000000000001s)]
*  the world. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1114.3s)]
*  What does that look like in terms of patient lives? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1115.5s)]
*  What it means for patients is that we're going to meet the total patient demand for cell [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1120.02s)]
*  therapies globally and make it so that no patients have to die on the wait list ever, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1124.44s)]
*  but all the patients can get access to the cell therapies. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  We're no longer supply constrained as an industry. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  We're no longer suffering from a cell therapy manufacturing bottleneck that cost lives today. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1137.4s)]
*  From a Solaris perspective, I foresee that Solaris is going to be the de facto standard [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1145.5200000000002s)]
*  for a cell therapy manufacturing across the globe. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1150.3600000000001s)]
*  Like I said, we're going to help create a world where no patients are dying on the wait [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1154.32s)]
*  list for cell therapies. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1158.82s)]
*  Then beyond that, Solaris is going to apply the same high-tech approach that we're known [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1161.1799999999998s)]
*  for in the cell therapy space to other drug modalities. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1167.26s)]
*  If you're thinking of Solaris, really think of a high-tech next generation biopharmaceutical [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1171.86s)]
*  manufacturing company. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1175.86s)]
*  We could call it a smart factory, right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1178.34s)]
*  This is some terminology that's been used with regards to Solaris before. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1180.3s)]
*  Can maybe you describe what makes your whole process smart or what differentiates a smart [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1185.0s)]
*  factory from a typical cell therapy factory? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1190.62s)]
*  Yeah, what we're deploying inside of our smart factories are not just our two flagship technologies, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1193.94s)]
*  the cell shuttle for automated cell manufacturing and the cell queue for automated quality control, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1201.1399999999999s)]
*  but we're actually deploying the whole technology ecosystem. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1206.96s)]
*  There are dozens of software systems that are all interconnected with the custom cell [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1210.66s)]
*  shuttle and cell queue software such as our QMS, EMS, LIM systems. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1215.96s)]
*  It's a whole technology ecosystem that works in a very integrated cohesive fashion. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1224.04s)]
*  To make this a little bit more concrete for you, some of the things that I'm talking about [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1231.06s)]
*  is the automated generation of electronic batch records, for example. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1235.04s)]
*  Today when a cell therapy is manufactured manually, human operators are generating about [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1241.96s)]
*  500 pages of paper-based batch records by hand. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1247.76s)]
*  Imagine that for every single patient, they're writing a whole book of quality documentation [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1253.1599999999999s)]
*  by hand on paper for every single patient. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1259.62s)]
*  Now try and do that for 100,000 patients a year per drug. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1263.36s)]
*  That becomes prohibitive. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1267.8s)]
*  You just cannot. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1268.8s)]
*  What we're doing with the cell queue is we're actually automating the process of doing quality [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1271.1999999999998s)]
*  control, we're automating sample prep and the analysis of all of those samples on QC [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1275.9799999999998s)]
*  instrumentation. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1282.12s)]
*  Arguably, one of the most important things that we're automating on there is removing [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1283.12s)]
*  the industry from paper-based batch records to electronic batch records. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1286.86s)]
*  And we're auto-generating the content of those electronic batch records through software [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1291.06s)]
*  as opposed to manually generating the content of those electronic batch records by hand. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1298.3s)]
*  And that again helps us reduce labor, it helps us reduce cost, it helps us reduce opportunities [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1303.1799999999998s)]
*  for operator error. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1308.62s)]
*  This is one of many concrete examples for how we're making our factories smart. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1311.42s)]
*  Your commercial scale facility is in Bridgewater, New Jersey. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1319.02s)]
*  I think you're talking to us from New Jersey this morning. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1322.02s)]
*  How does it leverage the cell shuttle there to produce these therapies at scale? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1326.26s)]
*  What does it look like there inside the factory? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1330.7s)]
*  Bridgewater, New Jersey is our first commercial scale cell manufacturing smart factory in [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1334.42s)]
*  the U.S. We currently have five facilities in development worldwide. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1340.54s)]
*  So we're also building commercial scale sites in Europe and in Japan. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1345.26s)]
*  And in each of these facilities, we're deploying about 40 cell shuttles. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1349.18s)]
*  And each of these facilities depends on the length of the cell therapy process. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1355.06s)]
*  But on average, each of these facilities can produce up to 50,000 patient doses per year. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1359.5s)]
*  So a total of about 150,000 patient doses in capacity across all three facilities globally. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1365.1799999999998s)]
*  And that is really required because a single autoimmune disease, CAR T cell therapy, can [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1370.78s)]
*  have a patient population of up to 100,000 patients a year. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1376.2199999999998s)]
*  So it's not where we're at today. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1378.6999999999998s)]
*  The industry in the last year has produced around 10,000 patient doses across all of [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1380.9399999999998s)]
*  the approved cell therapies per year. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1386.54s)]
*  But it's rapidly growing. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1388.86s)]
*  And we're looking at the first CAR T cell therapy drugs that have patient populations [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1391.82s)]
*  where 10 times as large, 100,000 patients per year. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1396.7s)]
*  So really what it looks like in these smart factories that we're building out is [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1400.7s)]
*  rows and rows of cell shuttles. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1404.94s)]
*  Each cell shuttle contains two industrial robots. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1407.1s)]
*  Cell shuttles are loaded with technology. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1411.18s)]
*  So it's a really high tech facility of the future where ultimately hundreds of [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1412.86s)]
*  robots are manufacturing life saving cures for cancer in a fully automated fashion. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1418.46s)]
*  So maybe you can walk me through that particular workflow there. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1424.54s)]
*  How do patient cells enter the factory? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1428.54s)]
*  How do they get processed by the cell shuttle? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1430.54s)]
*  And how do they exit so that they become a ready to use therapy at the other side? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1433.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1437.66s)]
*  So the whole cell manufacturing process really starts at the hospital where [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1438.6200000000001s)]
*  the blood product is collected from the patient called an aphoresis. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1443.5s)]
*  This looks a lot like getting hooked up to the dialysis machine. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1451.34s)]
*  So the aphoresis machine pre enriches the blood a little bit. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1455.1s)]
*  So what they're shipping to a centralized cell manufacturing facility is not whole blood in [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1459.02s)]
*  most cases, but a blood product that has been enriched for white blood cells. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1464.22s)]
*  And that gets shipped to a centralized manufacturing facility like the ones at [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1470.06s)]
*  Solaris operating in a frozen state. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1475.02s)]
*  The first thing that we do is we thaw the cell type of product [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1477.1799999999998s)]
*  and begin the manufacturing process with white blood cell enrichment in the centrifuge of our [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1481.58s)]
*  cartridge to further enrich the blood product for just the white blood cells. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1488.94s)]
*  Then we use magnetic cell sorting to subselect a particular T cell population out of the white [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1493.5s)]
*  blood cell population. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1502.38s)]
*  That's the particular cell population that we're working with to actually generate T cell therapy. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1503.34s)]
*  Next, we activate this T cell population. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1508.38s)]
*  So we're adding some reagents that signal to the T cells we're under attack. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1511.1s)]
*  We need to divide, we need to multiply. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1515.18s)]
*  We've got a war to fight against the cancer cells. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1519.18s)]
*  And then what we do next is we genetically engineer them. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1522.8600000000001s)]
*  And this is the key step. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1527.42s)]
*  The genetic engineering happens through either CRISPR or a viral vector. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1529.1000000000001s)]
*  And it results in the T cells now expressing a new receptor on their cell surface that enables them [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1533.18s)]
*  to recognize and kill the cancer cells that before they were oblivious to this receptor is called a [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1540.7s)]
*  CAR, a chimeric antigen receptor. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1545.3400000000001s)]
*  This is why they're called CAR T cells. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1548.22s)]
*  This receptor enables them to recognize and kill the cancer cells. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1550.6200000000001s)]
*  Thereafter, we have these cells divide and multiply in the bioreactor. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1555.02s)]
*  In the end, we go through some cell washing steps, fill, finish formulation, and take the final drug [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1560.86s)]
*  products, formulate it into vials, freeze that down, and ship the frozen vials back to the hospital [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1567.58s)]
*  where the drug product gets infused back into the patients. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1575.26s)]
*  And the whole process, the whole vein to vein time typically takes a few weeks, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1578.38s)]
*  depending on the particular cell therapy product. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1584.14s)]
*  And our aim is certainly to reduce vein to vein time as well and make this process faster. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1586.0600000000002s)]
*  You talked about the CAR T cells, but you're also working in areas like stem cells as well. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1595.5s)]
*  Is the smart factory, is the cell shuttle modular enough and flexible enough that you're [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1602.22s)]
*  able to work on different cell therapies? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1606.62s)]
*  Yes. The cell shuttle today actually can support every single CAR T cell therapy that's on the [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1610.1399999999999s)]
*  market today, out of the box, on the same hardware. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1618.9399999999998s)]
*  And whether we make, you know, Yaskarta, Ticartas, Brayansi, Carvicti, you name them, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1622.3799999999999s)]
*  which of these cell therapies we make on our platform is really defined in software. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1631.26s)]
*  So one of the key innovations of the cell shuttle platform is its flexibility. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1636.0600000000002s)]
*  And the fact that everyone uses the same hardware, or rather we use the same hardware [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1640.38s)]
*  to manufacture a wide variety of different cell therapies that are on the market today. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1647.02s)]
*  We're already working on the next version of the cell shuttle that is also going to support [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1652.46s)]
*  NK cells, T regulatory cells, hemotropic stem cells. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1658.3s)]
*  But we really started with both the Thomas and Algenic CAR T cells and TCRs, which is what [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1662.46s)]
*  we're supporting today, because that's where most of the market is today. That's where [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1667.42s)]
*  most of the excitement is at. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1671.3400000000001s)]
*  One of the things you said that really differentiated you was the ability to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1674.46s)]
*  have so much more throughput than everybody else, and to be able to push forward and do [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1679.74s)]
*  16 at the same time that someone's doing one to really 10x what's already out there on the market. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1684.38s)]
*  How do you balance that sort of throughput on one side with cell therapies, which are really [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1689.8999999999999s)]
*  personal, which are just for one person? Is there a conflict there at all? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1695.74s)]
*  I think concept that's really helpful here is mass customization. This is a trend that is [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1702.62s)]
*  enabled by automation that we're seeing in quite a wide variety of industries. But [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1708.9399999999998s)]
*  the cell shuttle, and particularly the software that runs the cell shuttle, is a prime example [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1716.22s)]
*  of mass customization, where through software-defined manufacturing, all of the complexity of the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1720.86s)]
*  different cell manufacturing processes is really handled in the software, and the hardware is [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1727.98s)]
*  flexible enough to support all of these different cell manufacturing workflows. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1733.1s)]
*  It's interesting that you mention other industries. One of the things that comes to mind is [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1738.54s)]
*  just how much of cell manufacturing is a manufacturing or a business problem, much like [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1742.7s)]
*  manufacturing anything else. Can you take inspiration from other industries? Are there [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1749.0200000000002s)]
*  other ways and other domains where you're able to draw from and say we could try something like [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1754.38s)]
*  this, we can adapt from and learn from what others have done in completely different industries? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1759.9s)]
*  Absolutely. I come from the aerospace industry. Coming from aerospace into the life science [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  tool space, it's always surprised me that there are very successful companies that have [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1772.1399999999999s)]
*  a toy on the market that really has a very, very low level of engineering rigor. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1781.02s)]
*  So what we're bringing over from the aerospace industry is a lot of engineering discipline, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1787.58s)]
*  and in the aerospace engineering industry, we're building some of the most complex and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1792.46s)]
*  sophisticated technical systems that humans have ever built, such as airplanes and rockets. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1796.94s)]
*  Yet flying is the safest mode of transportation on Earth. How have we managed to build such a [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1804.7s)]
*  technically sophisticated and complex system, yet make it incredibly reliable? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1811.5s)]
*  This is achieved through systems engineering. Systems engineering is a meta-discipline. Systems [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1816.94s)]
*  engineers don't actually build or design anything. What they do is they organize all the other [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1821.58s)]
*  engineering disciplines into a very methodical process for product development that starts by [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1828.86s)]
*  collecting user needs, they turn user needs into requirements to drive the architecture. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1833.5s)]
*  You minimize the number of dead ends you walk down. They also do a thing called design for [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1841.26s)]
*  failure modes and effects analysis where you analyze ahead of time what could possibly go [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1846.3s)]
*  wrong here and you design mitigation paths for failure scenarios into the design. An example of [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1851.58s)]
*  that would be you're in an airliner, a flock of ducks hits your right engine, the right engine [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1858.1399999999999s)]
*  goes up in flames. It's no problem because your airliner is designed to keep on flying and safely [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1865.1s)]
*  landing with the left engine only. In much the same way, we've built mitigation paths for any [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1873.26s)]
*  kind of process failure scenarios into the cell shuttle. So reliability was always top of mind as [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1879.5s)]
*  we were building the cell shuttle. The way we achieve this is by leaning on engineering disciplines [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1888.3s)]
*  that really come from the aerospace industry. You mentioned before you've got your manufacturing [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1896.46s)]
*  site in New Jersey. You're looking to expand now into sites in Europe and to Japan. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1902.46s)]
*  Do the regulatory requirements for manufacturing cell therapies, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1908.54s)]
*  do they differ across these regions? Is that something you have to deal with? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1911.82s)]
*  I will say by and large the differences between the different regulatory authorities are minor. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1916.38s)]
*  There are differences but FDA, EMA, PMDA, they've done a really good job of harmonizing overall and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1921.82s)]
*  I think they're getting better at it especially with newer drug modalities like cell therapies [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1930.06s)]
*  that realize collaboration and standardization across the globe is really of top importance. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1936.78s)]
*  So it's not a big challenge for us. You mentioned the FDA. You've met with the FDA. Have they given [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1944.54s)]
*  you any particular feedback around cell shuttle and your closed system approach and has that [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1950.94s)]
*  impacted your strategy? The agency by and large is very supportive. Peter Marks, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1956.54s)]
*  current director of CBER, actually has a slide in many of his presentations where he talks about [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1964.3s)]
*  cell therapies and he shows a picture of a solar vending machine. He says what we need in cell [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1971.34s)]
*  therapies is a solar vending machine where you press the Pepsi button and Yascarta comes out, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1976.86s)]
*  you press the Coca-Cola button, Carvicti comes out, you get the idea. My point to Peter has [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1984.62s)]
*  been over the last few years, that's exactly what we've built at Solaris. That solar vending machine [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1991.1799999999998s)]
*  is called the cell shuttle. You press the right button, the right cell type product comes out [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1995.34s)]
*  fully automatically. Beyond that, we've had many interactions with regulators early on through the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=1999.34s)]
*  FDA's CAT pathway, which is a pathway that the FDA has created to have an early dialogue with [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2007.4199999999998s)]
*  developers of advanced manufacturing technologies like Solaris. We've received really helpful [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2015.6599999999999s)]
*  feedback from the agency on our overall approach and by and large we're in alignment. The FDA has [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2022.78s)]
*  actually confirmed that our building is a closed system and that because it's a closed system, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2029.34s)]
*  we can operate in controlled and classified environments as opposed to clean rooms. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2034.62s)]
*  We can actually do multi-product concurrent manufacturing on the cell shuttle, which is a [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2040.54s)]
*  big important point, the ability to make different cell therapies for different patients on the cell [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2046.54s)]
*  shuttle. At this point, we're quite a few steps further along where our interactions with the FDA [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2050.38s)]
*  are often in collaboration with our commercial clients, with our biotech and pharma customers [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2059.66s)]
*  to actually support the regulatory pathways of their particular cell therapy assets. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2068.38s)]
*  You mentioned that differences there between the FDA and so the EMA as well are minor, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2073.9s)]
*  but are there adjustments that you're having to make when it comes to opening a facility in Europe? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2080.22s)]
*  Yeah, once you get into the details, there are certainly differences, but that's why we have a [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2085.66s)]
*  very large quality team and a very large regulatory team to handle all of those regulatory interactions [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2091.1s)]
*  and make sure we're in compliance with FDA standards in the US, EMA standards in Europe, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2097.58s)]
*  and PMDA standards in Japan. I'm just going to take you on just a final question here, Fabian. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2103.74s)]
*  As we get to the end, where do you see Solaris in the industry itself? Do you see yourself as [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2112.14s)]
*  the leader? Do you see yourself as the only choice moving forward for others? Are there [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2118.86s)]
*  ways that you could adopt a leadership position? There are one, two, three different approaches [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2124.46s)]
*  to smart manufacturing for cell therapies and you're one of the ones playing in that space. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2130.22s)]
*  Where do you see the company moving forward? So leader, one of the big options? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2135.98s)]
*  I think we're going to be the dominant player in cell therapy manufacturing and that's because [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2143.66s)]
*  today, Solaris is really the only game in town that can offer 10x scalability at about half the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2149.82s)]
*  price compared with conventional CDMOs and all of our technology competitors are years behind. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2157.2599999999998s)]
*  We've got both the cell shuttle for automated manufacturing and the cell cube [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2165.98s)]
*  commercial ready, CGMP compliant, and the technological capabilities of the cell shuttle [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2171.9s)]
*  are far beyond what anyone else has come up with to date and within quality control. We're actually [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2178.54s)]
*  the only company that's even attempted to automate quality control for cell therapies, but it's the [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2185.98s)]
*  second half of the puzzle. It's equally important as automating manufacturing. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2190.54s)]
*  That said, there are huge first mover advantages in our industry. That's because pharma is [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2196.06s)]
*  inherently risk-averse and pharma does not like adopting new technologies. In cell therapy, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2202.86s)]
*  they have to because the problem of commercial-scale cell manufacturing is new. It really only exists [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2209.18s)]
*  as of 2017 when Kim Ryar, the first FDA-approved cell therapy, came on the market. Prior to that, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2215.5s)]
*  cell therapy was an academic pursuit and everyone was running clinical trials with maybe 100 patients [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2221.5s)]
*  per clinical trial, but nobody had the problem of how do you scale up from 100 patients to 100,000 [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2227.1000000000004s)]
*  patients per year per drug. The problem is new. It's been unsolved this far. The pain is huge [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2233.34s)]
*  because patients are dying on the wait list and pharma companies are missing out on billions of [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2241.82s)]
*  dollars of revenue and the manufacturing costs are prohibitively high. Here's Solaris. We're [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2247.02s)]
*  offering to meet the total patient demand for cell therapies globally while reducing the price [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2253.98s)]
*  by a factor of two. We're literally cutting it in half. That is a strongly differentiated value [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2259.5800000000004s)]
*  proposition. The moment that we do this in the clinic, we're about a year away from being in the [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2264.94s)]
*  clinic, two years away from being in commercial-scale manufacturing, I think the floodgates will open [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2270.7s)]
*  because put yourself into the position of a tech-ops leader at a pharma company. By the time that [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2275.2599999999998s)]
*  Solaris has proven that we can do commercial-scale manufacturing and do that at the scale and the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2283.74s)]
*  price points that they're promising, I don't think anyone else is going to go with a second mover [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2291.2599999999998s)]
*  company that promises to be commercial-ready and CGMP compliant three or four years later. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2297.98s)]
*  You may have heard the saying, nobody ever got fired for hiring IBM. There hasn't been an IBM [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2304.94s)]
*  yet over the last few years when it comes to cell therapy manufacturing. Solaris is poised to be the [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2314.2200000000003s)]
*  IBM of cell therapy manufacturing, the proven, reliable, established choice within the next one [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2321.66s)]
*  or two years. That's where I see the industry going and because of that, I think we will be the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2329.02s)]
*  de facto standard for cell therapy manufacturing three, four, five years from now. It's an exciting [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2333.66s)]
*  journey ahead. Fabian, thanks for joining us today on Beyond Biotech. Thank you so much. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2339.42s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQjzMBxXI&t=2344.78s)]
