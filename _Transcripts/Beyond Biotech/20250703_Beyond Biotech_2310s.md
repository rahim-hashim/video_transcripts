Video Description: The World Health Organization reports that more than 600 million people suffer from lower back pain globally, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide. 
Chronic lower back pain – where the pain persists for more than 3 months – develops in between 5 and 10% of all lower back pain cases, with life-altering impacts for patients.
And that’s where today’s guest, Steve Ruston, of Persica Pharmaceuticals comes in. Persica is developing a groundbreaking and transformative treatment for chronic Low Back Pain. Persica is targeting the cause of chronic lower back pain: the underlying bacterial infection. Unlike conventional approaches that manage symptoms, Persica’s drug enables the infection to clear, reducing inflammation, pain and disability at the source.

# Persica Pharmaceuticals is treating the cause of chronic lower back pain, not just the symptoms
**Beyond Biotech:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Cassane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 154 for the podcast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=11.84s)]
*  You get older, your back hurts. Seems like a truism doesn't it? Just one of those things. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=16.2s)]
*  The World Health Organization reports that more than 600 million people suffer from lower [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=21.84s)]
*  back pain globally, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide. Chronic lower [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=27.04s)]
*  back pain, where the pain persists for more than three months, develops in between 5 and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=32.82s)]
*  10 percent of all lower back pain cases, with life-altering impacts for patients. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=38.0s)]
*  And that's where today's guest, Steve Rustin of Persica Pharmaceuticals comes in. Persica [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=44.32s)]
*  is developing a groundbreaking and transformative treatment for chronic lower back pain. They [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  target the cause of chronic lower back pain, the underlying bacterial infection. Unlike [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=55.5s)]
*  conventional approaches that manage symptoms, Persica's drug enables the infection to clear, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=62.26s)]
*  reducing inflammation, pain and disability right at the source. I hope you enjoy my discussion [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=67.9s)]
*  with Steve as he walks me through Persica's mission, ambition and science. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=74.2s)]
*  Steve Rustin, welcome to Beyond Biotech. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=81.1s)]
*  Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be able to talk to you today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=84.58s)]
*  Steve, you've had a long career working in research, in academia, then into entrepreneurship [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=88.58s)]
*  as well. From your really early days in organic chemistry through to your role today as the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=95.58s)]
*  CEO of Persica Pharmaceuticals, what really sparked your interest in getting into this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=100.86s)]
*  area, this biotech and pharmaceutical sector? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=105.9s)]
*  So as you say, I did a PhD in synthetic chemistry in the UK, which I did enjoy. And it was always [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=110.34s)]
*  my aim to move into industry at the completion of the PhD, preferably deploying the chemistry [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=119.5s)]
*  skills I'd learned in the first instance. And therefore I joined the first of three [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=128.52s)]
*  large pharma companies. And the role was then to develop the synthetic chemistry processes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=136.5s)]
*  by which emerging new drugs would be manufactured once they hit the market. That was great fun, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  quite challenging, because if a drug is going through development rapidly and the progression [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  into larger scale clinical trials, which are needed before it can hit the market, you need [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=157.7s)]
*  to be able to make the drug quickly to the right quality, with the right shelf life, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=162.62s)]
*  etc, etc. So it was an application of science to a really focused development and corporate [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=167.74s)]
*  timeline, which was a good start for my career. However, I always intended to move into wider [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=176.58s)]
*  operations, manufacturing, for example, and I had a number of career breaks in the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies I worked with, which widened and deepened that experience, still [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=191.73999999999998s)]
*  building on chemistry, but also learning related sciences, all of which are required in drug [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  development. So some biological sciences, for example, regulatory understanding of what needs [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=202.61999999999998s)]
*  to be done in order to get a drug approved. And then I had the opportunity to move into an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=210.26s)]
*  international role. So there was a kind of stepwise development, but founded in good [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=215.54s)]
*  science. I've had the pleasure of working with some brilliant scientists now in many [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  companies in different locations. And that's where the interest started. And I've kept it ever [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  since. Along the way, some of these drugs that you've been involved with, you've had a hand, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  I guess, in Tagamet, Zantac, Viagra, these are blockbuster drugs. And you were involved in some [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=238.38s)]
*  part in the development of these. You talked about lessons and the experience, what sort of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=245.1s)]
*  lessons did you take from working on these sorts of blockbuster medications? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=250.14s)]
*  Well, firstly, particularly early in my career, my contributions to the team working on those [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=255.42s)]
*  drugs were small, they were huge teams. But even when the medicine is approved, there are often [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=261.86s)]
*  refinements to either the way it's made, or you get line extensions, so maybe the product [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=269.26s)]
*  starts off as a typical pill, but you may then have some different formulations, which have [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=274.94s)]
*  different attributes. So there's a constant investment in developing the products, developing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=280.74s)]
*  the patent estate, and you're very well aware, even at a relatively junior level of the commercial [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=288.34s)]
*  imperatives around this. So one of the lessons I learned in my second main company was that Tagamet [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=294.98s)]
*  was a groundbreaking anti-ulcer drug, for example, it was first in class medicine. But then it was [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=302.58s)]
*  very seriously challenged by Zantac, which Klaxo developed. And there was a huge corporate battle, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=309.62s)]
*  some litigation, some patent challenges, none of which I'm happily was involved in personally, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  but you see all of that stuff going on in those sort of organisations. And it just widens your [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=322.62s)]
*  perspective. But also I learned that we were working on second and third generation anti-ulcer [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=328.78s)]
*  drugs. And the development programme had reached a pretty advanced stage. And then for technical [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=336.05999999999995s)]
*  reasons or safety reasons, the programmes were terminated. And we had put an awful lot of time [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=344.46s)]
*  and effort in, including the teams I was an active part of, which showed there's no guarantee [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=353.14s)]
*  of success, even if you're working in a field which has got a developed pathway forward with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=359.58s)]
*  the first in class drugs already on the market. So I learned early on that drug development is [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=366.86s)]
*  very difficult. And most programmes and most individual parts of programmes don't succeed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=372.82s)]
*  And that's still the case, I think, for most companies today. So if you can get associated [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=379.65999999999997s)]
*  with something that is a success, it's a great feeling. And you sometimes have to work a long [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=384.74s)]
*  time before you experience something like that. You're based in the UK today, but you said you've [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  had some international experience as well in North America and Latin America. I mean, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=397.58s)]
*  how have these shaped how you work at Persica today? That's a really good question. So [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=402.5s)]
*  I've been fortunate to have a very interesting and quite wide ranging career path, I should say [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=409.38s)]
*  that many of the career opportunities I got weren't necessarily planned. So for example, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=418.9s)]
*  I moved into my first role in manufacturing in the UK. And then shortly afterwards, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=426.38s)]
*  the company concerned decided to close that part of the facility. So the choice then was either [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=432.97999999999996s)]
*  to go back into R&D, which while I enjoyed, it's what I had left already. Or they said, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=439.9s)]
*  actually, we've got an opportunity for you in Latin America, would you like to take it? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=445.97999999999996s)]
*  And I did take it. And I was doing chemistry again in the manufacturing facility, but in a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  completely different part of the world, a different language, different culture, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=459.02s)]
*  at least on the surface. It was a fantastic opportunity. I learned so much, including the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=463.9s)]
*  ability then at least to be able to work in Spanish, which I wouldn't have done otherwise. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=471.7s)]
*  But what I learned was that people, they needed some investment in them as individuals, they [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=476.17999999999995s)]
*  needed investment into their facilities and into their plant and equipment. And I was there to do [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=484.02s)]
*  some of that. But people respond to how you treat them. That's my overwhelming lesson. And it was a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=490.9s)]
*  fantastic experience. So yeah, I was in Latin America for two and a half years, but spent quite [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=499.82s)]
*  a few weeks in the USA because these were American companies, what it's an American company I was [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=506.06s)]
*  working for. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=510.7s)]
*  Now, the company you're working for now is and where you're the CEO is Persica Pharmaceuticals. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=512.38s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about the work that you're doing there and the mission of this company. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=517.78s)]
*  Okay, so Persica is a small biotech company headquartered in the UK. And we were able to set [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=522.62s)]
*  that up by hiring a small number of very experienced people with pharmaceutical industry [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=530.86s)]
*  backgrounds. And there's been huge attrition in R&D and manufacturing facilities in the UK and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=538.12s)]
*  many other countries. So there was a pool of experienced people around. And Persica was set [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=545.0s)]
*  up to bring forward a new drug for the treatment of chronic back pain, which is a huge medical [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=551.08s)]
*  issue. It affects so many millions of people globally. And the founders of our company who, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=558.04s)]
*  in part, were academic researchers and medical practitioners, had established a link for certain [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=564.68s)]
*  back pain patients that the likely cause of their pain was a bacterial infection in the spine. And [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=572.28s)]
*  that if you could treat that infection, not only could you alleviate the symptoms, but you would be [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=579.8s)]
*  treating one of the underlying causes of the disease, of the pain. And that is one of the big [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=585.96s)]
*  differentiators from what we're doing and other approaches to back pain. So we were set up quite [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=593.32s)]
*  specifically to work in one area of research, chronic back pain, and to bring forward a drug [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=599.48s)]
*  that would meet the needs of patients and the regulators and the markets. And that was the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  mission statement from day one. And we're very pleased with the progress we've had over the last [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  few years, which has recently culminated in a successful conclusion to our first human patient [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=618.36s)]
*  trial of our new drug. And you're collaborating then with the academic institutions where you're [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=623.72s)]
*  able to draw people from healthcare institutions as well? Well, we have a number of, as you will [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=630.36s)]
*  know, drug development is a multi-discipline activity. In the large pharma companies, most of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  those activities are done inside the company. We're a small biotech, so we can't do that. So [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=645.88s)]
*  the way we do the work is to have contracted partnerships primarily with the organizations [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=652.52s)]
*  that are serving the pharmaceutical industry. So manufacturing, for example, regulatory advisors, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=660.76s)]
*  preclinical development activities, testing of the drug in terms of its shelf life and stability and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=667.88s)]
*  quality. So we've built a network of partners. Most of those are not academics, although we do [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=674.76s)]
*  have links into academia for specialist insights or references. And we still have good contact with [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=681.72s)]
*  our academic founders, but they are academics. They're great at what they do, but they don't [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=690.84s)]
*  have experience with drug development, certainly targeted at human clinical trials, and then [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=696.2s)]
*  eventually into the marketplace. So we're more industry focused than academia, I guess, in our [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=701.8s)]
*  partnerships. Now the approach that you've got at Persica is antibacterial. It's not an opioid. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=707.4s)]
*  You're not using an opioid to address the pain there. Has that helped when you go out into this [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  market now where people are maybe shifting away from opioids if they can? Very much so. And we've [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=719.16s)]
*  commissioned recently some independent market research around the likely receptivity for our [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  approach, assuming we get the same results in the larger clinical trials, which will be the next [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=733.48s)]
*  stage in our drugs development. The use and abuse of opioids is a huge problem, as you will be aware, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=739.56s)]
*  and there's also visible consequences of that in various places around the world. So the idea that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=747.64s)]
*  you can bring forward an effective treatment for people who've got significant back pain, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=756.92s)]
*  and in many cases have had it for years without recourse to heavy duty analgesics, including [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=763.0s)]
*  opioids, will be attractive. And I said at the outset, what we do here is try and address [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=769.24s)]
*  the cause of the problem, not just treat the symptoms. And we're hopeful that if things work [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=776.68s)]
*  out on the larger trials, as we are appropriately optimistic that they will, not only will you not [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  be treating people with opioids, many of our intended patients are taking long-term analgesics, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=791.08s)]
*  including opioids themselves, as a palliative treatment. And I think there's every prospect [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=797.72s)]
*  that the reduction in analgesic use and the reduction of opioid use can derive for what [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=804.2s)]
*  we're doing, and that would be really exciting. I think what's really interesting about your [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=811.48s)]
*  approach is what you say about not treating the symptoms, so we're not just trying to take the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  pain away, we're trying to address the cause of the pain. Is a bacterial infection, is it always [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=820.6s)]
*  the cause of chronic lower back pain, or are you looking at a subset of patients, sir? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=826.36s)]
*  No, it's not the only cause. There are many causes, and some can be quite simple. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=830.36s)]
*  Oh, you know, if you overdo it digging the garden, for example, you may well [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=837.16s)]
*  cause yourself some back pain that's relatively transient. It can probably be fixed by mild [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=842.12s)]
*  analgesics or some manipulation or whatever. Our patient groups have failed what we call [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=848.6s)]
*  conservative therapy, so they will have had it an absolute minimum of six months. The things that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=854.04s)]
*  you normally get advised to do when you first go to your doctor don't work for these patients. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=859.72s)]
*  There may be other causes, so for example, if somebody unfortunately has a tumour in their [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=867.08s)]
*  spine, that's not what we're going to address, or you've got other physical deformities perhaps. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=871.88s)]
*  So we think maybe 25% of chronic back pain patients may benefit from what we're trying to do. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=877.72s)]
*  That's still a very large number because the number of chronic back pain patients [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=885.48s)]
*  globally is a huge number. So not everyone will benefit, and we don't claim that, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  but we think there's a very significant number and therefore a very significant potential market [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=896.12s)]
*  for people likely to respond to our approach. Tell me about this approach, the actual treatment [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=902.12s)]
*  there. It's an injection, and it's not multiple injections, right? It's not one every month or one [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=908.2s)]
*  every week. No, that's again, it's a really good question. So our drug has been designed and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=914.28s)]
*  developed within Persica, and it has some particularly novel attributes. So it's an [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=921.4s)]
*  injection of a long-used generic antibiotic, so it's not a new molecule, but the way it's packaged [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=927.64s)]
*  in the injection vehicle is unique, and that derives our intellectual property and patent state. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=935.48s)]
*  And what we do is we make a very fine powder of the antibiotic and suspend it in a liquid which [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=943.4s)]
*  is called a thermosensitive gel. This has the property that at ambient or cold room temperature [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=951.0s)]
*  it's a mobile liquid, but when it warms up to about 37 degrees in the body it turns into a thick paste, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=957.8s)]
*  and the intention is that you inject it to where the infection is, and we can see that on the MRI [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=965.72s)]
*  images which help us identify our patients. You inject it directly to the site of the infection, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=973.0s)]
*  and the delivery of the antibiotic has a very fine powder in this gel type liquid as it becomes, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=980.04s)]
*  gives you a depo effect, it gives you a local concentration of antibiotic which lasts for [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=988.6800000000001s)]
*  several days, and that gives the antibiotic time to kill the bacteria, and then it slowly dissolves [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=996.52s)]
*  and disperses over about four to five days. So the overall dose in your system is much lower than [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  the standard course of antibiotics, and it consists of just two injections in the first [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1012.44s)]
*  week of treatment. That is the end of it. So you're talking about a very high localised dose, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1017.24s)]
*  but very small, very low systemic exposure in the body, so the side effects from treating the drug [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1022.7600000000001s)]
*  will be minimal. It's a well-known, well-characterised, and well-used drug anyway. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1029.0800000000002s)]
*  We're injecting it to the level lower than its normal use, and therefore, systemic exposure and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1035.88s)]
*  the risk of developing antibiotic resistance by using very high doses of antibiotics for a long [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1043.96s)]
*  time are eliminated by design, and that's why we've got, I think this is our USP, we're treating the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1049.72s)]
*  underlying cause of infection. We have a unique formulation with intellectual property protection, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1057.48s)]
*  to the best of our knowledge, and we've done, as I say, some market research around the competition. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1065.0800000000002s)]
*  Nobody else is doing this, at least at the moment, so we're very excited by all of that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1071.24s)]
*  But to come back to the start of your question, it's a very short course, just two injections, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1075.88s)]
*  and that is the end of it. It does take time for the effects of killing the bacteria to kick in. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1081.4s)]
*  The bacteria cause inflammation and bone degradation in the spine, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  which is why patients have their pain and disability most of their waking hours, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1093.48s)]
*  sometimes 24-7. For the bone to remodel, for the inflammation to go away, and for the pain to [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1099.08s)]
*  subside, it can take up to a year or even longer to fully benefit, but we do see substantial [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1106.52s)]
*  improvements, certainly by three months. In treatment of chronic back pain, that's a pretty [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  good result, and the reduction in pain and disability that our trial has shown are very [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1121.64s)]
*  substantial for the patients who responded to it. It can be a transformative experience [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1127.0s)]
*  if they respond to the drug in the way that it's designed to do. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1135.48s)]
*  Tell me more about those impacts on patients, because I see the Phase 1B trial, you had this [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1139.72s)]
*  reduction in pain, you talked about a reduction in disability. What does that actually mean in [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1145.64s)]
*  practical terms for a patient? What can they expect? If you ask somebody how much pain you're [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1150.76s)]
*  feeling, it can be slightly subjective. There's a well-recognized pain score that goes from 0 to 10, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1157.8799999999999s)]
*  and if you say that 10 is the worst pain you can possibly imagine, whatever that might be, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1166.6s)]
*  that's excruciating, whereas 0 to 1 is little or no pain. Most of our patients were coming in around [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1173.72s)]
*  6 to 7 on the pain scale, which is pretty significant, and they would see perhaps [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1183.1599999999999s)]
*  30, 40, 50% reduction in pain scores during the treatment, but more measurable is the reduction [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1190.4399999999998s)]
*  in disability. If it's too difficult for you to bend down and tie up your shoelaces or pick your [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1199.08s)]
*  children up or ride a bicycle or go to work, you can measure those impacts. We did see significant [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1205.24s)]
*  reductions in both pain and disability, and the impact of that, and this is what our founders also [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1213.48s)]
*  showed with their treatments using very high doses of oral antibiotics. The patients who responded [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1219.24s)]
*  to this, the life in many cases was transformed because they could go back to having a normal [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1225.96s)]
*  life or something very close to it, whereas before that, their life is very significantly impacted. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's challenging, and if you live with it all the time, not only can you not do the things that [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1242.28s)]
*  you would like to do, it can cause mental problems as well. People get frustrated or [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1247.48s)]
*  what have you, and the cost of healthcare systems is enormous because it's a chronic problem. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1253.56s)]
*  So I think for us, reduction in disability is at least as important as reduction in pain, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1259.08s)]
*  although of course they go hand in hand. You mentioned before something like 25% of chronic [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  lower back pain patients could benefit from something like this. How do you identify these [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1271.9599999999998s)]
*  patients? Is it all by MRI, and how important is that to the process? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1277.32s)]
*  So that's another really good question, and one of the key ways of doing it at the moment is through [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1282.12s)]
*  MRI imaging. So the patients that we think are likely to have the infection in the spine [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1287.72s)]
*  display some well-characterized or well-recognized images on their MRI [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1295.6399999999999s)]
*  scans, and these are called modic changes, and our medical founders linked the appearance of those [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1302.84s)]
*  changes to this potential infection. So you do it through a combination of detailed pain history, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1311.0s)]
*  pain scores. Clearly, if there's another mechanical cause of pain, they probably haven't got the [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1319.4799999999998s)]
*  infection, but right now the MRI is key to identifying the likely patients who will respond. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1326.76s)]
*  I need to explain that the amount of bacteria in the disc is quite low in terms of bacterial count. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1336.68s)]
*  You don't see the normal consequences of very high bacterial loads. So if you get a [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1344.6s)]
*  staph infection, for example, you may have temperature or fever. The patients don't show [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1352.04s)]
*  that, and because the bacteria are located right in the disc of the spine, it's virtually impossible [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1356.76s)]
*  to go in and take cultures of the bacteria to confirm that the patients actually have got the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1363.72s)]
*  infection. But by our best estimates so far, albeit on a small-scale trial, it's likely that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1369.96s)]
*  somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of our target patients will have the infection. It's quite [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1377.56s)]
*  difficult to measure low levels of these bacteria for technical reasons, and perhaps in time there [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1383.24s)]
*  will be some biomarkers developed that will help the identification of the patients. But [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1390.84s)]
*  you're right, right now it's largely through MRI imaging and detailed pain histories. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1398.9199999999998s)]
*  The current treatments we talked about before, they tended to treat the symptoms, and that was [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1403.96s)]
*  either a physical treatment like a physiotherapy, or it could be an opioid that's used to treat the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1408.52s)]
*  pain or address the pain. How does this actually, your approach, how does it change the landscape [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1415.4s)]
*  for treatment? If it really is just two injections in a single week and then the bacteria is killed, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1422.1200000000001s)]
*  it's gone away. This must change a lot of things. Well, we think it has the potential to change [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1431.0s)]
*  or add another element into the standard treatment pathway, which already exists. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1438.28s)]
*  So we've talked about the need to be able to see MRI scans of patients, and in some countries, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1444.2s)]
*  the UK is not particularly well served with the availability of MRI for various reasons, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1452.28s)]
*  but in other countries that's not true. So our founding research was done in Denmark, for example, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1457.64s)]
*  and we know the availability there of MRIs is much higher than in the UK. But in the United States, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1463.96s)]
*  clearly the biggest market of all, our expectation is that by the time a patient has had chronic back [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1470.68s)]
*  pain for a minimum of six months or more, they most likely will have had an MRI or would be en route [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1477.64s)]
*  to getting one. And if the patients recognise at that point with the images on the MRI that I've [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1485.16s)]
*  referred to, we believe a short course of two injections will sit very nicely into the current [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1492.0400000000002s)]
*  treatment pathway, i.e. after failure of standard care, early attempts at treating the problem, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1498.52s)]
*  but before much more serious and significant surgical procedures. So for some patients [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1507.0800000000002s)]
*  currently, their end game is to go into major spinal fusion operations, for example. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1513.24s)]
*  It can bring some relief, it can bring some reduction in pain, but these are major operations, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1520.76s)]
*  very expensive and not something you would undertake likely. Our proposition would be that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1526.44s)]
*  you give people the two injections and if after a period of time they're not responding, they can [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1535.56s)]
*  still go into those more aggressive surgical procedures, but we think a very large number of [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1541.08s)]
*  patients will not need them anymore because of the way we're treating the underlying cause of the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1546.6799999999998s)]
*  disease. So we think that once this is known and proven on a larger scale, we've only done a [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1553.24s)]
*  relatively small scale study so far and not yet in the United States, but we're working with very [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1561.32s)]
*  senior key opinion leaders in the US and in Europe and they're very excited about the [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1569.56s)]
*  potential of this as we are. So we don't see this as a disruptor of the cheap treatment paradigm, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1575.0s)]
*  it just gives you an opportunity to do something in that treatment sequence, which can be done [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1582.6799999999998s)]
*  quickly and simply and will, in our view, reduce future cost and major surgery and get people [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1590.28s)]
*  back functioning again. We think there's a very significant market potential for a drug doing it [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1599.8799999999999s)]
*  that way. I mean, your trial showed that there were some benefits as early as a couple of weeks or a [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1606.84s)]
*  month after the injections and that you could see some sort of continuing improvement out to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1613.64s)]
*  even to 12 months. What about in terms of durability? Are you actually solving the problem [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  permanently or is this something that you think they may have to return to in a couple of years? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1625.64s)]
*  So the evidence from our founders' work, who've been working with this antibiotic approach [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1631.0s)]
*  for many years now, is that in the vast majority of patients, if you kill the infection and you see [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1635.88s)]
*  the benefits I've described, they don't relapse. Unless there's some physical damage to the spine, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1642.6s)]
*  which could be the cause of an infection getting in, if that happened again, then of course it is [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1649.8s)]
*  possible that the problem might resurface. But in our experience, in our trial, and that does [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1655.08s)]
*  mirror what some of our founders' results were, was that the vast majority of patients don't relapse. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1663.0s)]
*  The benefits are long lasting. Our trial measured patients out to 12 months and there were still [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1670.68s)]
*  signs that some further improvements may well be possible. So right now we would expect that [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1677.24s)]
*  the benefits you see are there for an extended period of time, to say the least. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1683.72s)]
*  In terms of actually really changing the game here, if you're going to scale this treatment, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1690.44s)]
*  what sort of hurdles are you facing in terms of regulation and accessibility? Where's the [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1695.64s)]
*  big challenge for you there? So we're currently designing the size and shape of the [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1701.88s)]
*  future phase three trials, which as you will know, every drug has to go through before it can be [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1709.72s)]
*  approved for the market. We have our views on the size and shape of what those studies should look [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1715.16s)]
*  like and the number of patients that may participate in it. We're in the process of [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1722.76s)]
*  going to the respective regulatory agents to get their views on our proposals and hopefully buy [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1731.32s)]
*  into them, which is normal practice. So as I say, we're in the process of talking with the agencies [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1738.12s)]
*  to design those studies and they will give us their view on what they would expect in terms [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1745.64s)]
*  of regulatory compliance. First and foremost, it's got to be safety. That's their number one driver. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1752.36s)]
*  But we will also take advice from the industry and potential partners that we hope to work with [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1758.4399999999998s)]
*  around how they would pitch this in the marketplace subject to the larger clinical trials [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1764.6s)]
*  being successful. But I think the advice we're getting from the market analysis that we've done [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1770.6s)]
*  and also working with the very, very senior radiologists and surgeons that are part of our [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1778.44s)]
*  advisory group, they believe that the risk benefit of doing injection for the benefits [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1784.52s)]
*  for the responders that I've described will make this a compelling story for the regulators. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1792.52s)]
*  I guess we'll find out what their views are quite soon. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1798.6s)]
*  You're working in Europe and North America or anywhere else? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1802.84s)]
*  So the trial we've completed was done in the UK, Spain, Denmark and New Zealand. As I said earlier, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1807.0s)]
*  we haven't yet been into the United States. The founding work was done in Denmark and carried on [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1817.96s)]
*  in London. We're a small company. We didn't have the global reach to go into the US. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1824.6s)]
*  Some of the team did have first-hand experience of working with UK and European regulators. We [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1830.28s)]
*  actually got approvals to do our trial in other countries too, including France and Austria. But [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1836.28s)]
*  we believe that we're now having our first engagements with the US regulatory agencies [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1845.08s)]
*  and at least one of those major phase three trials will be done in the US. So it's a step [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1852.36s)]
*  change for the company over the next small number of years. It's a step change for the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1858.44s)]
*  development of the drug. It's very exciting, very challenging, but that's the normal path of [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1864.2s)]
*  a drug that's going to be developed for the global market. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1871.64s)]
*  You mentioned a few times the founders of the company have been working on this, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1875.24s)]
*  the fundamental research for many years. Are they still creating new insights today? Are [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1879.48s)]
*  you still learning more from the trials that you're doing, the tests you're doing? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1884.2s)]
*  Well, one of the two key founders has been a long-time academic researcher in the field of back [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  pain. So his work is continuing on multiple fronts. And then the second person, Hannah Albert, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1895.88s)]
*  she published the first major clinical trial using oral antibiotics more than 10 years ago. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1904.6000000000001s)]
*  And she is still treating people using that approach in her clinic. And that's where her [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1911.48s)]
*  focus is now. But their key contribution was to establish the link between chronic pain and an [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1921.0s)]
*  infection and then get the approval to carry out a placebo controlled study to demonstrate that [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1927.64s)]
*  that link was real. So they're not working with us on new approaches to that, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1936.0400000000002s)]
*  new approaches to this way of treating people. But of course, they're still active in the field. And [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1944.2800000000002s)]
*  they're aware of what's going on with other academic approaches to back pain or what other [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1950.44s)]
*  companies or other research groups may be doing. So yes, there is still the use of antibiotics [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1956.68s)]
*  elsewhere. But the problem with the founders approach, which is why we were set up in the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1964.92s)]
*  first place, is it's very hard to get oral antibiotics into the disk. You need huge doses [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1969.72s)]
*  for an extended period of time, which causes all sorts of issues. And it's not the basis of [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  a modern medicine, however great the founding research was. Looking forward now, as you're [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1982.28s)]
*  moving towards these new studies, these new trials, as a CEO, as someone running the company [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1990.28s)]
*  there, where do you see the milestones for your company moving forward in the next couple of [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=1996.2s)]
*  years? What are the big planks that you're moving towards? Well, the next short term milestone will [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2001.56s)]
*  be to get an agreement with the respective regulatory agencies on what they want to see [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2008.76s)]
*  in terms of the size and shape of these large scale phase three trials. Once we understand [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2015.24s)]
*  and agree that, we can then design the program to design and have those trials approved. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2020.76s)]
*  We're confident, appropriately confident, I think, that based on our founders work and what we've [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2028.52s)]
*  seen in our own phase one B study, that there's no obvious reason why the larger scale trials won't [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2033.88s)]
*  work as long as we select the right patients. So the short term thing is to get the approval to [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2040.28s)]
*  set those studies up and then do them. And hand in hand with that, and we've been working on this [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2047.3999999999999s)]
*  for two or three years, is to make sure we've got a manufacturing process that will be able to supply [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2052.6s)]
*  the drug for those studies and beyond to the right quality to meet all the regulatory requirements [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2059.0s)]
*  and to be able to produce the drug at a scale that larger trials and eventually the market will need. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2065.88s)]
*  So we're working on all of those things in parallel at the moment. I guess we've talked a little bit [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2073.0s)]
*  about regulation, a little bit about the treatment landscape and how this might eventually be adopted [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2079.2400000000002s)]
*  by the market. But what about the other big plank there, which is funding? What are you doing to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2085.0s)]
*  ensure that you can actually make this work and get the money in place? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2089.96s)]
*  Yeah, but that's always the killer question, isn't it? And if you run a biotech company, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2093.7200000000003s)]
*  whatever it is you're doing, I promise you getting funding and continuity of funding is probably the [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2100.6800000000003s)]
*  thing I think about more than anything else. I have to say we've been incredibly well supported [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2108.2000000000003s)]
*  by our investors and shareholders to date. We've worked very hard to keep them on board [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2114.44s)]
*  and they've stayed on board over many years in some cases. But we're moving into a new era now. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2121.64s)]
*  The larger scale trials and going into the United States will require both a pharmaceutical [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2128.28s)]
*  and a financial partner to help the company through the next stages. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2136.2000000000003s)]
*  But with the great results we've had from our study and the fact that we've got a good base to [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2139.7200000000003s)]
*  build on, it gives me confidence that we will do that. But as you can appreciate, going into [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2147.32s)]
*  large scale trials, particularly if you're in two continents, it's not a cheap exercise. But there [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2154.04s)]
*  are plenty of organisations out there that if they believe in your story and the potential and for [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2161.48s)]
*  the ability for them to make money, we believe securing that funding is a viable option for us. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2168.68s)]
*  A final question for me. We're talking about treating chronic lower back pain with a [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2177.08s)]
*  non-opioid approach. If we think about pain more generally and the treatment of pain, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  can you see a future where opioids would be relied on a lot less for treating other pain conditions? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2187.48s)]
*  I'm not really an expert on the best use of other pain conditions in terms of [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2194.2s)]
*  what are the optimum analgesics to use other than to say, as we've already touched on, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2206.6s)]
*  the use of opioids is a difficult problem. There are other companies researching in all [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2211.96s)]
*  other major international companies working in other pain treatments, different approaches [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2220.2s)]
*  to treating pain. That is something that we're not involved in. But I'm sure that the industry and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2227.8s)]
*  academic researchers will continue to strive for approaches that get you away from opioids [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2236.84s)]
*  where possible. But pain R&D and development of new pain medication is a very challenging [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2242.68s)]
*  field. If you work in, for example, osteoarthritis, for example, some of the issues with [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2249.96s)]
*  other drugs that have happened in the past, if it was an easy thing to do, it would have already [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2257.2400000000002s)]
*  been done. But I'm sure continued work will go into trying to reduce the dependence on [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2262.36s)]
*  opioids for sure. Steve Rushton, thanks for joining us today on Beyond Biotech. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ2icQuxxXc&t=2268.2000000000003s)]
