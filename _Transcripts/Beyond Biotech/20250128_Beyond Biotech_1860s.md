# Can cell therapy tackle hearing loss?
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 97. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTech. Today we're talking about something that will likely affect [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=16.28s)]
*  many of us at some point in our lives. I know it's already happened to me and that's hearing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=23.12s)]
*  loss. When it comes to the numbers it's kind of staggering as by 2050 nearly 2.5 billion people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=29.24s)]
*  will have some degree of hearing loss and at least 700 million will require some kind of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  intervention. While you can get hearing aids there aren't really too many other options but [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=45.36s)]
*  RINRI Therapeutics is looking to change all that. Today on the podcast we have a conversation with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=51.56s)]
*  RINRI CEO Simon Chandler about hearing loss, what's being done to tackle it and RINRI's novel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  approach to treatments. To get things started then I wonder if you could tell me a little bit [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=66.0s)]
*  about the history of the company. RINRI Therapeutics formed in 2019. Originally as a spin out from the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=71.08s)]
*  University of Sheffield in the UK and it was really based off the research that had been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  conducted by the lab of Marcella Rivolta who's a professor of sensory stem cells and hearing at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=85.84s)]
*  University of Sheffield and it's really a culmination of 25 to almost 30 years of his work really in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=92.84s)]
*  developing potential therapeutic modalities, therapeutic options for hearing loss. We were [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=100.68s)]
*  spun out with money and funding from the Boring Engelheim Venture Fund, UCB Ventures and Audley Park [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=107.56s)]
*  Ventures who kind of saw the possibilities that were inherent in what Marcella had done in his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=115.04s)]
*  research and then I suppose in the last almost five years now we have been taking that research [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=120.0s)]
*  and moving it closer and closer towards patients and the clinic and that's really what the purpose [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  of RINRI is really is to be a vehicle for that transition and that movement. It's funny you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=132.56s)]
*  mentioned that the company was started in 2019 and people would think it's a very new company [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=137.0s)]
*  but then you mention about how it's based on 30 years of research so it's kind of a little [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=142.72s)]
*  bit misleading sometimes when it looks like a new company. Yes we're standing very much on the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=148.4s)]
*  shoulder of scientific giants in that sense but ultimately therapeutic development takes a long [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=153.92s)]
*  time. It takes decades on average to take a discovery from an RMD setting and get it [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=160.16s)]
*  authorised and prescribed to a patient. It's a hugely long process and that's even more [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=167.76s)]
*  essential when you're looking at advanced therapies, you know looking at the cutting edge of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  modalities like cell therapies, gene therapies and RNA therapies which are obviously kind of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=176.88s)]
*  infamous or famous from the recent Covid times and these things usually take a very long time [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=183.2s)]
*  to get through. It's all the regulatory hurdles that you need to abide by to make sure these things [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  are going to be safe when you implant them into or deliver them into humans and it just takes a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=193.28s)]
*  long time. I wonder if you have any background or maybe even some stats on hearing loss and also I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=198.16s)]
*  guess it's more than just one thing isn't it? Absolutely hearing loss as a whole as a totality [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=205.76s)]
*  is a vast global problem and arguably humans have been in the midst of a global hearing loss [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=213.28s)]
*  pandemic really. There's some really interesting kind of startling facts in WHO that kind of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=219.52s)]
*  indicate that there are currently one and a half billion people in the world with some form of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  hearing loss and that's going to rise to two and a half billion by 2050. On one of those nearly [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  half a billion, that 500 million of those have what's called disabling hearing loss so this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=236.8s)]
*  hearing loss is so severe that it affects their day-to-day life and impacts their abilities to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=240.88s)]
*  I suppose take full participation in society so it reduces education prospects, employment prospects [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=247.04s)]
*  and really has a you know untreated hearing loss has direct impacts to mental health decline [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=254.64s)]
*  and importantly now it's been realised has a direct link to cognitive declines and particularly to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=260.0s)]
*  dementia so one of the highest modifiable risks or the most highest modifiable risks for you [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  developing dementia in later life is treatment of hearing loss so if somebody does not treat [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=272.8s)]
*  their hearing loss they are many more times more likely to get dementia than somebody who doesn't [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=277.76s)]
*  have hearing loss or treats their hearing loss so they're the kind of stats it's a very big problem [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=282.48s)]
*  these numbers are on a pile with conditions like osteoarthritis and diabetes have equal macroeconomic [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=288.88s)]
*  costs and microeconomic costs to countries and healthcare systems but I suppose the amazing thing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=296.16s)]
*  is that no disease modifying therapeutic has ever been approved for hearing loss so it's an amazing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=301.2s)]
*  white space that's there to develop something which can have real impact for patients both [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=308.4s)]
*  in short term and their long-term prospects. You mentioned mental health and I guess it's something [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=312.88s)]
*  that has only really come to the forefront in maybe the past decade or so where people [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=319.36s)]
*  will actually talk about it is there's the same kind of stigma about hearing loss because I think [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  that a long time ago people just accepted it as a fact of aging. I think people do accept it as a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  fact of aging that's one of the biggest causes of hearing loss is aging just a natural consequence [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=339.68s)]
*  of getting older but in terms of its stigma I think that's very much still there particularly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=344.56s)]
*  when you consider the current standard of care is limited to external medical devices like hearing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=352.88s)]
*  aids and cochlear implants there is for sure a stigma associated to having a visible external [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=359.52s)]
*  indicator of your hearing loss and the negative consequences of that I think that does impact [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=366.64s)]
*  the uptake of these devices for sure you know people get prescribed hearing aids they get [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  prescribed cochlear implants but then do not use them because they don't want to be labeled as [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=378.32s)]
*  having hearing loss because that has other consequences to people's perception of them [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=382.32s)]
*  which is unfair and it's just their hearing that's gone not they have any other necessarily any other [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=385.92s)]
*  cognitive issues but that's the stigma that gets associated to it. I think the mental health aspect [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  that we're referring to before is often a consequence of withdrawal from society and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  social environments so what has been found is that as people get harder of hearing as they [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=402.48s)]
*  progressively get more deaf it gets harder and harder for people to hear speech particularly in [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=408.08s)]
*  noisy backgrounds there's a whole cliche the cocktail party effect that environment where [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=414.08s)]
*  you've got this hubbub of noise around you becomes harder and harder to work in and live in and hear [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=418.08s)]
*  people's conversations so what people tend to do as a consequence of that is just not go to those [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  environments so they don't go to work they don't go to social gatherings they don't interact [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=428.56s)]
*  and then that has the direct consequence of people not socially interacting and therefore [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  not having interactions and humans being social beings that has a mental health impact. It's a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  relatively simple sequence of events but it's a big one because lots of people have hearing loss [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  that she's not treated at the moment or adequately treated. What's the difference between sensorineural [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=448.55999999999995s)]
*  hearing loss conductive hearing loss and mixed hearing loss and the treatments? Absolutely so [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean very basically hearing is dealt with by the ear in humans and obviously sound goes down [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=460.64s)]
*  the outer ear and hits the middle ear bones the famous kind of stapes incus malleus bones which [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=466.4s)]
*  effectively translate the vibrations of air via the tympanic membrane into vibrations in the fluid [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=473.76s)]
*  in a specialized organ called the cochlea and the cochlea contains specialist sensory cells which [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=479.28s)]
*  convert those vibrations in fluid within the ear into electrical signals so if you have conductive [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=484.56s)]
*  hearing loss that is an issue with the outer and middle ear so the conduction of the sound through [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=490.88s)]
*  air and then you have sensorineural hearing loss which is the death or damage to the specialized [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=496.32s)]
*  sensory cells within the cochlea so that's what we term sensorineural hearing loss. In terms of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=501.6s)]
*  relative frequency or incidence of these types of conditions approximately and very crudely 10% of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=506.72s)]
*  all hearing loss is conductive and about 90% is sensorineural so most of the problems that people [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=512.88s)]
*  have is with the sensory cells within the cochlea. The conductive hearing loss is relatively well [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=518.8s)]
*  dealt with by microsurgery now but the sensorineural hearing loss is less well treated. In terms of the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=524.56s)]
*  contribution of sensorineural hearing loss aspects so within the cochlea you've got these sensory [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=531.12s)]
*  cells called hair cells or auditory neurons and these two types of cells have different roles [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=536.88s)]
*  within the hearing kind of pathway. The hair cells effectively detect the movements of the vibrations [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=542.32s)]
*  in the fluid within the cochlea, their mechano transducer so they just move in relation to those [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  vibrations and send electrical signals basically through those cells to the auditory neurons which [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=553.5200000000001s)]
*  then relay those signals to the brain so if you lose either of those two types of cells you're [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=558.88s)]
*  basically losing a component of your hearing pathway and therefore you lose your hearing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=565.44s)]
*  The treatments for sensorineural hearing loss is limited to only the hair cells at the moment so [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=570.4s)]
*  both hearing aids and cochlear implants really only deal with the damage to the hair cells. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=576.96s)]
*  Hearing aids are very clever sound processors and translators they optimize the sound going into the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=583.28s)]
*  tympanic membrane so that you can use what you've got left in a better way but cochlear implants [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=589.84s)]
*  effectively bypass the damaged hair cells to directly stimulate the auditory neurons. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=595.28s)]
*  The consequence of this is that if you have neural hearing loss which is what RIMRI Therapeutics is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=600.16s)]
*  focusing on initially these devices don't really help because they rely on an intact neural [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=605.12s)]
*  architecture there to actually work so patients are currently prescribed these devices at the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=610.8s)]
*  moment but they're not that effective if you have a predominantly kind of neural basis to your hearing [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=616.72s)]
*  loss. Does the timing of when somebody goes to get hearing aids I guess does that the timing of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=621.84s)]
*  that impact on it if somebody were to be treated or the hearing loss acknowledged earlier along [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=630.08s)]
*  the line would that make any difference? Absolutely I think the earlier you are diagnosed with hearing [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  loss and what kind of hearing loss you have and you have an intervention the better. I think going [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  right to extremes you know children are they try to diagnose children with hearing loss as early [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=647.12s)]
*  as possible you know pre-lingually because if you can't hear you can't develop language skills and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=651.68s)]
*  once that kind of window opportunity is gone then it's very hard to then gain those language skills [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  even for older people so people with age-related hearing loss or even acquired hearing loss [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=660.96s)]
*  it would appear that the longer that you have that profound hearing loss the harder it is to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=665.28s)]
*  recover that or to treat that with the devices and we presume it will be the same for therapeutics [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=670.88s)]
*  such as Rindri Therapeutics are developing and the rule of thumb is if somebody's had you know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=675.68s)]
*  severe to profound hearing loss for over 10 years then it becomes really quite challenging to do [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=681.8399999999999s)]
*  something with that so the earlier people can get into primary care get referred on to ENT and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=687.76s)]
*  audiology the better the prognosis will be absolutely. A nice segue into what you're doing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=693.68s)]
*  there I wonder if you could talk a bit about the Osprey platform and RINCEL1. Yeah so as I mentioned [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=699.92s)]
*  you know there are no therapeutic treatments no regenerative therapies for any type of hearing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  loss there are only palliative medical devices which effectively deal with the symptoms of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=711.92s)]
*  hearing loss. Neural hearing loss in particular has no devices that can treat them obviously then the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  consequence of that is that these patients aren't being adequately treated and therefore the long [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=724.48s)]
*  term consequences you know I mentioned about mental health and cognitive decline are not being [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=728.8s)]
*  tempered by their treatments so the way Rindri thinks about sensing neural hearing loss is that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=734.56s)]
*  it's a cellular problem so it's the death or damage to these sensory cells and we believe our [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  hypothesis is that the best way to treat this is to replace the damaged cells with functional cells [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=746.64s)]
*  it's almost like a cell transplant it's a transplant of a functional cell population to restore what [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  was there before you know think of it like an organ transplant replacing that functional capability [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=756.56s)]
*  what we are developing at Rindri are progenitor cells so these are cells which are some way in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=761.76s)]
*  between a pro-apotent state so a stem cell and the mature auditory sensory cell state so they're kind [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=768.56s)]
*  of this intermediate state which is semi-differentiated but not fully differentiated and we create these [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  cells by using the OSPRA technology which is effectively a developmentally informed [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=782.16s)]
*  differentiation method which mimics the growth factors and signaling which occurs in the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=787.92s)]
*  developing embryo which is where these cells originate naturally in humans and we replicate [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=793.92s)]
*  that in vitro basically in a petri dish in a flask using the same signaling mechanisms in the same [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=799.76s)]
*  order in the same way to recapitulate that sequence and therefore develop these functional progenitor [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=805.52s)]
*  cells and that's in a nutshell the concept and then these cells are transplanted in and they can [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=810.48s)]
*  complete their maturation in the right environment getting the right signals from the native cochlea [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=816.0s)]
*  and complete that development and effectively reconnect the hearing system together. The cochlea [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  is quite difficult to access though how do you address that? Yes it is it is notoriously difficult [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  to access compared to the people who love pharmacology you know looking at the eye or [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=832.4s)]
*  you know people who can deliver drugs systemically through you know IV they have a much easier time [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=836.64s)]
*  of accessing their site of administration than we do so yes the cochlea is behind the temporal [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=842.4s)]
*  bone which is the hardest bone in the human body for us to get access to the cochlea we need to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  get through that bone. What we have decided to do at RIMRI particularly for our initial clinical [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=852.08s)]
*  studies is piggyback for want of a better term on the back of the cochlear implant surgical procedure [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=857.12s)]
*  because this is a routine way in which the cochlea is accessed in patients now who are receiving a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=863.44s)]
*  cochlear implant it's routine it's safe and actually we found we only need to do a minor [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  modification of that process to actually access the site of administration for our therapy [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  which was very similar to what we use in our non-clinical models. We've done this by building [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=882.0s)]
*  a consortium an international consortium of ENT surgeons from the University of Nottingham, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=887.12s)]
*  Guy's and St Thomas's, Uppsala in Sweden and also Western University in Canada to actually [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=892.96s)]
*  develop this solution to get access to the cochlea and what they did is they developed a 3D model of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=899.84s)]
*  the cochlea using synchrotron imagery they were able to put all the slices back together to create [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=906.32s)]
*  this 3D model which the surgeons were then able to use to effectively explore different routes of [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=912.0s)]
*  access to the site of administration this base of the nerve canal of the cochlea avoiding any risky [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  structures like nerves and arteries in the process and then take that on to do validation in kind of [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=926.64s)]
*  donated cadaveric material and we've now done that we actually published a paper back in the end of [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=932.32s)]
*  2023 in nature showing this for the first time that we were able to access this space and we [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=938.0s)]
*  could deliver cells to that space in human material. We've since developed that further [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=943.76s)]
*  and we've trained more scientists actually as well as surgeons in this process and we're now [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=948.88s)]
*  writing the surgical manual ready for our clinical trials next year. When you're talking about the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=954.56s)]
*  treatment is it a cure i.e. does it reverse the loss or does it just stop it from deteriorating? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=960.4s)]
*  So it's a really good question I think as a modality as a concept we are looking to replace [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=967.52s)]
*  the cells which are deficient or damaged or dead in the cochlea and therefore it is a solution that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=973.84s)]
*  has the potential to have broad application to the sensorineural hearing loss kind of patient [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=980.96s)]
*  community kind of independent of the etiology the cause of the hearing loss or the residual [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=986.4s)]
*  characteristics of that particular patient's cochlea and replace a functional population of [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=994.24s)]
*  cells. I suppose this differs quite substantially to some of the other therapies that have been [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=999.68s)]
*  developed in this area so particularly the gene therapies which have been having quite a bit of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1005.28s)]
*  noise recently the two US companies Decibel and Acuos who've got solutions for a particular [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1009.68s)]
*  monogenic condition otofurin which is great absolutely great for the patients but it's [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1016.16s)]
*  really only 20 000 patients in the world that have this issue so it's never going to treat the big [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  problem of age-related hearing loss and acquired hearing loss so in that sense to emphasize I think [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1025.36s)]
*  what we have is potentially a broad application our pre-clinical data services transplanting [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1030.32s)]
*  our cells into a model of the condition a rodent model of condition suggests that it has the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1035.6s)]
*  potential to be transformative to patients so we can restore hearing in the model of auditory [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1041.12s)]
*  neuropathy we are focusing on auditory neuropathy neural hearing loss initially we can restore [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1046.24s)]
*  hearing in those models by about 25 decibels which would be transformative to patients it [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1051.04s)]
*  would take them from being profoundly to almost totally deaf to being able to have a conversation [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  like we're having now so in a practical sense it would be very useful for these patients on a [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1061.52s)]
*  day-to-day basis and help ameliorate many of the things we've been talking about before in terms of [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  social interactions and engagement with society etc and also offsetting the potential development [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  of dementias but whether it would restore all hearing remains to be seen and I think that's [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1076.72s)]
*  why we need to go to clinical trials because there's only so far you can take any model of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1082.56s)]
*  any condition especially a sensory condition which is a very human thing where there are no real [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1086.32s)]
*  biomarkers you can't have a genetic marker for how well you're hearing can you hear classical [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1092.08s)]
*  music can you hear somebody speaking a particular accent all these things which are very human [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1096.8s)]
*  we have to go to humans to find out really where they're going and actually that brings me on to [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  another potential benefit of what we're doing is that there are solutions as I mentioned for hair [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1106.08s)]
*  cell loss the cochlear implants and hearing aids but there are a lot of frustrations from the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1110.24s)]
*  patient populations because these devices are great but they deliver unnatural hearing to patients [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  they're very robotic you know metallic noises very alien noises to actually hear so what patients [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  actually want is a natural hearing back so hearing that you and I have and hypothetically by restoring [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1126.32s)]
*  the biological mechanism of hearing with a cell therapy should in principle hopefully restore [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1132.96s)]
*  more natural hearing than than the devices again we won't know until we've done clinical trials [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1138.96s)]
*  and been into patients but again that's a potential another benefit as well as restoring absolute [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1143.28s)]
*  hearing which we obviously want to do it's potentially more nuanced as well I was just [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1148.48s)]
*  thinking about that as you were talking about it in terms of the restoration of hearing would this [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  be something that just as an example if somebody was in their late 40s and had this done because [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1158.8s)]
*  their hearing was damaged through music or whatever clearly as we age it deteriorates anyway do you [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  think that this is something that you would need to redo at certain points in the future or would [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1172.72s)]
*  it would once be enough our vision our hope is that this would be a one-time treatment certainly [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1178.56s)]
*  again in preclinical models the data we have would indicate that this has the potential to [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1186.16s)]
*  be a very long-term solution for restoring hearing loss but again I just want to caution [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1191.44s)]
*  that statement with the fact that we are looking at a xenograft model a preclinical model there [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1197.28s)]
*  are many differences to the human condition but if you take a few leaps of faith on that and say yes [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1202.0s)]
*  the model is very equivalent to humans then there is potential for a very long-term at least decades [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1208.16s)]
*  long restoration of hearing using this therapy however if this case was that it wasn't a permanent [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1213.6s)]
*  solution and you know they did degrade over time then there is precedence in ENT surgery for doing [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1220.08s)]
*  revision surgery on cochlear implants so yes theoretically you could redeliver a population [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  of cells back into the patient and effectively I suppose top up or restore the hearing back again so [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  I think both avenues are there our vision clearly is to go for the one-time solution [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1238.08s)]
*  that's what we'd like to do. You mentioned a couple of companies doing other means of addressing this [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1243.68s)]
*  are there many others addressing this? At the beginning of this conversation we mentioned the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1251.12s)]
*  white space as I call it in hearing loss it's a massive condition and you'd think that pharma [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1256.0s)]
*  companies and biotechs would have spotted this opportunity a very long time ago and it's not the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1261.36s)]
*  case really that the world is full of technologies and companies developing solutions for hearing [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1267.76s)]
*  loss therapeutic solutions for hearing loss and I think there's only been 20 to 30 companies and [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1273.44s)]
*  projects ever since the history of time developing therapeutic solutions for hearing loss most of [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1279.36s)]
*  those have been really focused on auto protection so that's stopping things getting worse once you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1285.12s)]
*  kind of identify you've had a toxic event you know a toxic shock and very few have taken on the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1290.16s)]
*  developmental issue of or the restorative issue of a therapeutic so I mentioned the gene therapies [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1295.6s)]
*  and they're great I mean absolutely fantastic news it's like five companies developing gene [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1301.28s)]
*  therapies for autotherapy absolutely brilliant restoring hearing in children who otherwise would [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1306.3999999999999s)]
*  never have heard anything is a fantastic result but as I mentioned it's a relatively small patient [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1311.1999999999998s)]
*  population tens of thousands in total compared to hundreds of millions for the problem in hearing [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1316.24s)]
*  loss there are companies looking at the hair cells looking at attenuating some of the hair cells so [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1321.28s)]
*  a kind of a sister company of an anacusia also funded by Boehringerheim are looking at that kind [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1328.08s)]
*  of aspect using a novel chemical entity so a small molecule approach and there were a couple of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1333.12s)]
*  companies looking at trans differentiation which is the ability to try and change the type of cell [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1338.72s)]
*  in the ear into another type of cell in vivo so basically turning a supporting cell into a hair [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1345.52s)]
*  cell in this case a couple of companies called frequency therapeutics this one company was very [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1350.72s)]
*  prominent in that great science and the lab bench but didn't translate in vivo so they're no longer [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  pursuing that particular aim in terms of our approach the self therapy approach were pretty [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1360.96s)]
*  much the only ones doing this and pioneering it and the reason is not because yeah with only [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1365.92s)]
*  ones kind of crazy enough to try it it is quite difficult thing to do it's a logical thing to do [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1371.2s)]
*  and academics have been trying to do this cellular approach for you know 20 or 30 years really since [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  the advent of stem cell technologies but it's proved difficult to create the cells which are [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1382.88s)]
*  functional in vivo and that's what we have at ring me therapeutics that's the unique [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1388.8s)]
*  capabilities that we have is to make these cells which not only look right have the right markers [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1392.56s)]
*  but actually when you put them into an organism they actually function as you expect them to do [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1396.88s)]
*  and that's what we're doing and we're targeting neural hearing loss first and we want to move on [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1400.72s)]
*  after that to do other parts of the hearing loss pathway i guess one of the things that is associated [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1406.0800000000002s)]
*  with hearing loss is that we talked about it earlier that it's just a natural part of aging [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1412.24s)]
*  but then you mentioned those connections to dementia so clearly there's a bigger economic [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1417.44s)]
*  cost than one would initially expect what is the economics of what you're doing i mean is it a costly [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1423.52s)]
*  procedure i mean in terms of economics of the therapy all advanced therapies in the early stages [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1431.36s)]
*  of their development have a price tag i mean it won't be a surprise to you or to your listeners [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1437.6799999999998s)]
*  the gene therapies out there you know you've got one to four million dollars per dose you know [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1443.12s)]
*  they're in they're very very high levels so i think atv has always come with a higher cost and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1446.9599999999998s)]
*  than small or large molecules just by their inherent complexity but i think what we have [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  is a process which is inherently robust and scalable and whilst at the early stages of [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1458.56s)]
*  development where it's a very low scale so costs tend to be relatively high we are very cognizant [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1464.8s)]
*  of the big problem in hearing loss also democratization of therapies for hearing loss [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1470.72s)]
*  is very important to us so we are very keen on continuing to explore how we control costs how [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1476.4s)]
*  we bring costs down in the future so that we can roll this out should it be successful to you know [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1483.52s)]
*  not just the most wealthy countries in the world and not just the wealthiest people in those [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1490.32s)]
*  countries as well but to everybody who could benefit from it because that's the only way in [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1493.92s)]
*  which as you mentioned the bigger macroeconomic costs that are impacting countries around the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1498.48s)]
*  world can be dealt with by treating you know not just tens or hundreds of patients but hundreds of [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1503.44s)]
*  thousands of patients and the only way you can do that without bankrupting healthcare systems is by [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1509.04s)]
*  pulling the price down we clearly can't be charging four million pounds a dose for this so we don't [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1513.76s)]
*  know what it will be yet but it's certainly an important thing to us and our investors that's [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1519.6s)]
*  accessible and i said we are looking at scaling to enable that access in the future but then as you [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1523.52s)]
*  mentioned if dementia is a side product of hearing loss then there's also that secondary economic cost [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1529.28s)]
*  of families having to look after elderly family members with hearing loss and so it's more than [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1536.56s)]
*  just the person that's got absolutely absolutely it's a really interesting point you make there so [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1542.56s)]
*  you see these numbers being banded around quite a lot in many indications about what's the economic [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1548.72s)]
*  costs of this indication you know i think the estimate last estimates i saw for hearing loss [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  were in the trillion dollars a year globally these numbers are very hard to validate where they come [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1556.56s)]
*  from and what they really mean and interestingly enough we do health economics and market access [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1561.6799999999998s)]
*  calculations you don't really include the secondary effects the wider macro effects of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1566.8s)]
*  a condition on individuals their families or economies and i think it's something [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1573.04s)]
*  personally which does need to be done particularly for these conditions like hearing loss [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1578.8799999999999s)]
*  to really understand the value potential of these hearing loss yeah we can do the standard health [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  economics model looking at an individual patient and what they would gain in terms of their quality [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1587.9199999999998s)]
*  of life you know the quality of life for just a year calculations that's fine but it doesn't [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1592.24s)]
*  really capture the bigger societal consequences of these conditions but at the moment it's not [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1596.48s)]
*  something which is routinely done and you know actually rimry is looking to work with organizations [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1601.68s)]
*  like the bio industry association to start looking at some of these questions because [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1608.64s)]
*  you've got other sensory conditions being looked at with atmp so i've mentioned ophthalmology [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1612.4s)]
*  already you know and they obviously do have somewhat higher costs than conventional medicines but they [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1616.72s)]
*  do have potentially bigger impacts and bigger value propositions than are currently captured [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1621.92s)]
*  so we do need to start looking towards that as a government's you know internationally and i think [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1625.92s)]
*  hopefully hearing loss could be a way to leave that going forward what's your timeline like i [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  know you mentioned you were looking to move into clinical trials soon yeah timelines are that we [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1634.24s)]
*  are presently in what i call either a late pre-clinical phase or near clinical phase depending on [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1641.28s)]
*  which way you want to look at it from but in reality we are this year finishing off the final [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1646.88s)]
*  regulatory approval data set packages so what we call cta enabling because we're looking at doing [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1653.84s)]
*  the first in human study in the uk under the mhra so that would be a cta clinical trial [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1659.36s)]
*  authorization we'll be finishing two major pieces of work this year which will enable us to file our [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  cta early 2025 and we have been working very closely with our clinical sites already so that [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1670.0s)]
*  we are quite confident that should we get the cta we'll be moving into first in human in kind of [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1676.72s)]
*  half on 2025 so pretty much this time next year and our top line data will be out halfway through [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1682.64s)]
*  2027 with possibility of some early readouts earlier than that as well to give us indications [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1690.24s)]
*  of more rapid clinical benefits and establishing that clinical proof of concepts sooner so we're [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1695.76s)]
*  really trying to accelerate through this first in human clinical trial this phase one 2a which will [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1701.92s)]
*  enable us then to clearly raise more money to take us into later stage clinical trials and get it to [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1707.3600000000001s)]
*  patients quicker are there any other things that are in your pipeline that you're working on yeah [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1712.16s)]
*  definitely i think we're always going to be a hearing loss company we're focused on that but [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1716.96s)]
*  what we're looking to do is look at other aspects of hearing loss as we develop so as i mentioned [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1721.28s)]
*  sensing or hearing loss is caused by the death or damage to the auditory neurons or the auditory [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  hair cells we're initially focusing on the auditory neurons so rin cell one is our lead product [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1731.76s)]
*  and that is an es derived population of human otic neural progenitor cells so that's rin cell [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1736.88s)]
*  one that's looking at treating neural hearing loss we've then got a an early pipeline product [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1742.88s)]
*  called rin cell two which is looking at deriving the same population of cells but from ips cells [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  rather than es cells so these are somatically derived cells what this enables us to do is [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1753.3600000000001s)]
*  look at a second generation of this first product which could take advantage of the new generation [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1758.64s)]
*  of ips cells so the hypoimmune cells which would give rise to a universal treatment without the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1763.76s)]
*  need for any even short-term immune suppression for patients either in trials or later today so [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1768.96s)]
*  that's the real angle we want to pursue and then rin cell three third product is a stem cell derived [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1774.88s)]
*  otic epithelial progenitor cell population and these are the progenitors of the auditory hair cells [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1780.72s)]
*  so the other part of the hearing loss problem so the idea is that we are developing solutions [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1785.8400000000001s)]
*  for all of sensing neural hearing loss and that's what we're kind of pushing forwards but our [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1791.2s)]
*  focus at least in the near term is to push rin cell one the first generation of the neural [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1796.0800000000002s)]
*  progenitor therapy through the clinical proof concept first and then once we've done that then [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1802.56s)]
*  we can reignite and accelerate the pipeline products going forwards that's I suppose our [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1807.28s)]
*  commercial strategy or our research strategy to do that [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1811.76s)]
*  that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1814.56s)]
*  hearing loss is definitely something that so many people have or will need to address as they get [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1819.44s)]
*  older so it's good to hear an overview of just how this massive problem can potentially be [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  tackled don't forget to check out the latest news and articles over at the biotech.eu and I hope [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBckFf_qItQ&t=1831.76s)]
