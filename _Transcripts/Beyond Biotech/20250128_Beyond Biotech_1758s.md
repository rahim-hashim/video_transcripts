Video Description: Rare diseases affect around 1 in 2,000 people. Many of the thousands of rare diseases are difficult to diagnose. Of the known rare diseases, about 80% have genetic causes.  


Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic disorders for which there is currently no curative therapy.


This week on the podcast we are discussing novel treatments of rare pediatric diseases in a conversation with Dan Williams, CEO, executive director and co-founder of Synaptix Bio. Synaptix Bio is working on developing treatments for severe leukodystrophies. 


The company has partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to take a TUBB4a leukodystrophy therapy to the clinic and beyond. 


01:41-05:08: About Synaptix Bio
05:08-07:07: What are rare diseases?
07:07-09:36: How do you develop treatments for rare diseases?
09:36-11:15: How many rare diseases have treatments?
11:15-13:32: What is the space looking like for companies looking to develop rare disease treatments?
13:32-14:10: How does the fact that many rare diseases are genetic affect drug development?
14:10-16:21: Do the low numbers of people with rare diseases affect funding and research? 
16:21-17:55: Are the drugs being developed useful in treating other diseases?
17:55-22:44: What is H-ABC?
22:44-23:25: Are there any treatments for H-ABC? 
23:25-25:15: Where is Synaptix Bio with clinical trials?
25-15-27:40: How do you design clinical trials for H-ABC with the number of patients being low?

*  Register at kbibiofarma.com. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=65.92s)]
*  This week on the podcast we are discussing novel treatments of rare pediatric diseases [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=72.84s)]
*  in a conversation with Dan Williams, CEO, Executive Director and co-founder of Synaptics [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Bio. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=85.28s)]
*  Synaptics Bio is working on developing treatments for severe leukodystrophies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=86.28s)]
*  Alright well thanks Dan for being involved in the podcast and so to get things started, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  I wonder if first you could tell us a bit about the company. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=97.48s)]
*  Yeah, so Synaptics Bio was officially founded three years ago in April 2021 by four co-founders. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=101.76s)]
*  There's myself, there's a lady called Michelle or Dr. Michelle Tang who actually is a parent [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  of a patient with HABC which is hypermalination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=116.08s)]
*  One of the co-founders has a huge amount of experience with setting up biotech companies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=125.74s)]
*  and running biotech companies and the fourth one is an investor who also has a lot of experience [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=131.14s)]
*  with really founding and getting companies off the ground and moving. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=139.66s)]
*  We are a virtual company and by virtual what I mean by that is we don't have very many [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=145.48s)]
*  So we have the board which sits and manage things as boards should and then as myself [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=150.86s)]
*  as a full-time employee, I have a scientist who is also a full-time employee and I have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=157.86s)]
*  a personal medical team as well and between us what we do is we manage all of the work, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  we outsource everything with the idea that we can review the science, we can manage and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  direct where things go and manage either CROs, contract research organisations and clinical [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=179.78s)]
*  research organisations, manufacturing organisations as well to do the work that we need to have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=186.38s)]
*  done and then we bring the data back in, review the data, figure out where we need to go next [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=193.62s)]
*  and it's a constant cycle through, we get some data in, we review it, we design experiments [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=199.3s)]
*  and send the work out again. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  The company really got moving when we got the licence to commercialise a therapy from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=208.74s)]
*  the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, we got that licence fairly early on which allows [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=215.66s)]
*  us to develop therapies in this particular area so top 4A, Leukodystrophy and HABC and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=220.86s)]
*  also allows us to use some of their data that they had previously where they had started [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=230.5s)]
*  to do the research and it was with that that I was then able to use the information that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=234.82s)]
*  I gained on what could be done commercially to then raise money and over the three years [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  we've raised around 13 million altogether to push into research and development and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=244.9s)]
*  then onwards to clinical trials. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=250.62s)]
*  There's a really nice background story to how this kind of came about as well, I've [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=252.54s)]
*  mentioned Michelle Teng who is the parent of the patient, they were looking for ways [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=257.06s)]
*  to accelerate treatments and accelerate research and they very very closely were talking to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  and linked with a particular lab at CHOP, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=269.85999999999996s)]
*  Michelle with three other parents set up a foundation, a charity and they raised money [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=275.82s)]
*  which they then sent across which then helped the research move forward and it was a conversation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  between her and one of the other co-founders that really came to the conclusion that actually [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=287.94s)]
*  a charity can only raise so much money and the tens of millions that are required to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=293.9s)]
*  do development really needs to come from investors. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=298.46s)]
*  That's where I got involved was thinking about the commercial proposition and setting the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=301.78s)]
*  company up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=307.38s)]
*  I guess we're going to be talking about some specific rare diseases today but I'm wondering [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=308.54s)]
*  maybe to set the scene and obviously not an exact number but what's the definition of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=313.66s)]
*  a rare disease and how many are there and how many are pediatric out of that big picture [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=320.06s)]
*  of rare diseases? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=326.98s)]
*  There's a couple of different definitions depending on where you are but I think the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=329.1s)]
*  main definition which comes from the World Health Organization is that a rare disease [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=334.14s)]
*  is a disease that affects one in 2000 people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=339.78s)]
*  The NHS also go with that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=342.58s)]
*  In the US it's thought of as being a disease that affects less than 200,000 people within [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  the US but as you can see we're getting into small numbers of people that have these diseases [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  and then you have a massive scale. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  Some will affect one in 2000, some will be even rarer than that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=360.5s)]
*  The disease that we're looking at is somewhere between one in 85,000 and one in 150,000 which [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=365.70000000000005s)]
*  is classed as being ultra rare. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=371.54s)]
*  Rare diseases themselves, how many are there? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=373.98s)]
*  Again there's different numbers that are thrown around but I would say there's around 7,000 [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  diseases that are really known, particularly in the UK 7,000 affecting around 3.5 million [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=382.74s)]
*  people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=387.94000000000005s)]
*  There's slightly different numbers that are thrown out in the States but it gives you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=388.94000000000005s)]
*  a good idea of the number of diseases that are out there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=393.42s)]
*  The actual causes of the diseases or the pathology of the diseases, we're starting to find that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=399.14000000000004s)]
*  a high number of them are actually genetic and I think it's around 80% of them tend [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  to be genetic and 70% of these rare diseases tend to present in children as well. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=412.3s)]
*  The problem with some of these rare diseases is that they have a high mortality rate so [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=420.70000000000005s)]
*  the children tend to die quite early with these diseases and the issue that is very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=425.22s)]
*  difficult with this is that diagnosis can be extremely difficult as well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  So if you've got children that die very early and it's very difficult to diagnose them, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=436.3s)]
*  sometimes the diagnosis is not really going to get them to anywhere where they can be [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=443.06s)]
*  And then the other issue is that there's not very many treatments for a number of them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=447.14s)]
*  I think there's only roughly around 10% of rare diseases in general have some sort of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=452.26s)]
*  treatment otherwise it's treatment of symptoms really and trying to improve quality of life [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=458.58s)]
*  for those patients. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=465.94s)]
*  So when it comes to the rare disease that you're looking at or some of the rare diseases [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=468.02s)]
*  that have treatments already, how do you approach the entire pathway of developing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=474.3s)]
*  a treatment because as you said quite often children are dying young and it doesn't really [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=481.86s)]
*  give an opportunity for diagnosis or study. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=486.86s)]
*  Yeah so diagnosis is a big thing and I think the advent of sequencing is really helping. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=490.54s)]
*  The issue is I think now that there has to be an awareness of a lot of these diseases [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=496.82s)]
*  both at public level and within the medical profession as well. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=504.06s)]
*  And of course the issue is always going to be that you can't know everything and you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=509.54s)]
*  can't know what's going on with every patient that comes in but if there's more information [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=513.7s)]
*  that can come from genetic sequencing then these diseases can be picked up earlier or [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=520.3s)]
*  is the possibility that they could be picked up earlier. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=525.94s)]
*  To be able to pick up the diseases you have to understand the disease in the first place [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=528.74s)]
*  and you have to have a good idea of not just what the visual symptoms are but actually [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=533.86s)]
*  what's the molecular causes of these things. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=538.02s)]
*  What are the mutations that you're looking for? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=541.02s)]
*  Which ones will really affect those patients? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=542.98s)]
*  It's a very difficult thing to be able to do. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=546.78s)]
*  There are a number of initiatives out there that allow sequencing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=550.38s)]
*  It's coming in earlier and people are being sequenced earlier within the presentation [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=556.42s)]
*  of their diseases which will give a really good idea of how to move treatment forward. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=562.2s)]
*  So that's a big thing I think is if we can get a lot more sequencing done and understanding [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  done then perhaps these things could be tackled earlier. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=573.6s)]
*  You mentioned 7,000 rare diseases and again it's impossible to give a number and it's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  also very difficult because there will be a range of rare diseases that have treatments [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=581.76s)]
*  that range from extremely effective to not very effective but how many of those 7,000 [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=588.36s)]
*  have treatments or have people working towards treatment? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=596.36s)]
*  I don't know about working towards treatment but I can tell you that at least through the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=601.28s)]
*  FDA approved systems and drugs that are available there's about 10% I think are really targeted [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  at the moment which is not a lot. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=613.88s)]
*  I'd like to say the effectiveness of some of these treatments as well simply because the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=618.24s)]
*  effectiveness of some of these drugs will depend on the stage that the disease is at [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=622.52s)]
*  within the patients and if they are quite well progressed and it's very very severe [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=628.72s)]
*  then sometimes some of these treatments won't work quite as well as if they're not as far [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=636.16s)]
*  progressed. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=640.8s)]
*  It's very difficult to say but the drugs that are out there through the FDA they will have [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=641.8s)]
*  been through clinical trials and they will have seen positive results from them so there [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=648.28s)]
*  is obviously a benefit from having them but there's a lot of rare diseases where there [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=651.96s)]
*  is either no research that's going on or they're not recognised or it's just simply not understood [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=657.96s)]
*  the mechanisms that the disease works by and therefore developing a therapy is going to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=665.12s)]
*  be a little way off until that's done. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=672.04s)]
*  Obviously again you can't speak to every rare disease although when you mentioned 10% [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=675.8s)]
*  700 out of 7000 leaves an awful lot of room for companies to get involved. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=681.8s)]
*  What is the space looking like for the development of new treatments for rare diseases right now? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=689.3599999999999s)]
*  As I'm seeing there are a number of companies that are getting involved in rare diseases [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=698.64s)]
*  and there's a lot of work that is being done in a number of different areas and different [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=704.04s)]
*  disease types and the companies that are getting involved range right the way through from [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  large pharma down to small biotechs which is great and there's obviously research that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=716.12s)]
*  goes on in universities and if they're like us we have kind of latched onto a rare disease [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=722.88s)]
*  and a technology that works in that disease and we're taking it through the development [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=729.92s)]
*  which I believe that biotech companies are quite good at doing that research early development [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=733.8s)]
*  work and through to early clinical work. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=739.64s)]
*  So I'm seeing that the field is getting bigger and it's getting better and a lot more things [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=743.72s)]
*  are being targeted but my experience over the last three years has really been that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=748.8s)]
*  you need a commercial proposition at the end of the day as well for a biotech and you raise [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=754.48s)]
*  money against that and it can be extremely difficult to make that argument and actually [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=760.64s)]
*  raise money to be able to do it and that's one of those things that's very difficult [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=767.68s)]
*  to do but there are some incentives out there. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=772.92s)]
*  There are often drug incentives, there's things like the rare pediatric designations and priority [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=777.4s)]
*  review vouchers in the states that really do help with various tax incentives, they [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=783.72s)]
*  help with actually raising money and they help you on your way towards doing the development [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=791.52s)]
*  work and it's these things that will keep companies doing this and will keep companies [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=796.9200000000001s)]
*  interested and involved. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=801.76s)]
*  And there's some fantastic science out there I have to say, there is some brilliant science [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=804.64s)]
*  and you need the science to be able to move things forward. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=808.12s)]
*  And I guess you were mentioning that a lot of these diseases are genetic so that kind [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=812.32s)]
*  of leads people in a certain direction anyway. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=816.48s)]
*  I think that a number of companies that specialise in particular areas will pick up on some of [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=819.08s)]
*  these rare diseases so if you are a gene therapy company and you have a platform then slotting [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  one of these diseases into your platform becomes very attractive to do as well. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=830.48s)]
*  I think that a lot of companies have developed their platforms and are taking them on which [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=835.08s)]
*  is really leading to a number of new projects that are coming out which is quite exciting [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=841.3s)]
*  as well. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=846.9s)]
*  Then actually potentially partnerships as well. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=847.9s)]
*  You mentioned the fact that the fundraising can be challenging and also you mentioned [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=850.3399999999999s)]
*  that some of the larger pharma companies are getting involved. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=855.62s)]
*  Is there kind of the possibility or the potential for the lower numbers of people suffering [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=860.02s)]
*  any particular rare disease to adversely affect both fundraising and also the attractiveness [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=867.34s)]
*  for big companies to get involved if they're not going to be selling it to millions and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=874.9399999999999s)]
*  millions of patients? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=879.9s)]
*  So having a market is something that I wouldn't say just big pharma, it's investment companies [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=881.78s)]
*  so venture capital companies etc. are looking for and they're looking for ways to get a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=887.58s)]
*  return on their investment, potentially make some profit on their investment and it is [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=893.02s)]
*  a larger risk for them to fund a company that potentially has a lower market. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=898.02s)]
*  I think what you find then is that the prices of the treatments actually go up and they [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=905.1s)]
*  become more and more expensive because they're expensive to develop anyway because there's [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=910.9s)]
*  very few numbers of patients out there. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=915.9399999999999s)]
*  But then the markets are so small that the risks are extremely high. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=919.3s)]
*  I think the way the pharma fund can be quite different and they may not be but they still [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=924.9s)]
*  have to take into consideration the markets as well and it's something that you have to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=929.38s)]
*  have a commercial proposition for at the end of the day. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=933.78s)]
*  And when you're looking at a disease that maybe has 200 patients it's going to be very [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=936.14s)]
*  very difficult to say there's a market out there but my feeling is still that we are [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=940.6999999999999s)]
*  heading towards trying to commercialise something so that there is a therapy for patients and [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=946.82s)]
*  it's something that it is possible to do and it's possible to do with a lot of the incentives [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=953.82s)]
*  that are out there that regulatory bodies and governments actually give. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=959.14s)]
*  For instance grants, there are grants that really help doing the development and they're [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=963.78s)]
*  non dilutive as well and when you have the grants and you have that due diligence done [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=968.54s)]
*  on a grant does help investors actually kind of step in and see that what you're doing [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=973.38s)]
*  has a potential that's there. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=979.78s)]
*  And I guess there are also some diseases whereby what you're working on may be applicable in [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=981.78s)]
*  other areas so it has more than just one potential use. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=987.98s)]
*  Yeah and as I mentioned there are companies that have platforms and if you have a you [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=992.78s)]
*  can develop a platform in a particular area and if you can modify that platform to then [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  enable treatment of another disease then that really helps because that just builds [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1001.98s)]
*  your market. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1006.74s)]
*  We're looking at trying to develop things for top four in Leukodystrophy that I mentioned [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1007.74s)]
*  earlier on and there's four diseases according to the FDA that are within that so essentially [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1012.38s)]
*  we are developing for one and we use all of that learning to develop for another one and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1018.0600000000001s)]
*  we have the potential to really take the incentives on two different areas which will then drive [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1023.1800000000001s)]
*  the company forward. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1029.38s)]
*  I haven't mentioned it in full but there's a thing called the Priority Review Vouchers [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1030.46s)]
*  which if we get to a point of a conditional biological licence application for one of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1035.42s)]
*  the drugs we can potentially get a Priority Review Voucher which will either accelerate [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1041.8600000000001s)]
*  us to market or we can sell that which we can then plough the money from it back into [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1047.6200000000001s)]
*  research. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1052.42s)]
*  These things are extremely important for rare diseases and it's not really a true exit [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1054.14s)]
*  as it were but it is a point that actually you get reinvestment back into the company [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1061.14s)]
*  from being able to sell that voucher to be then be able to move other things forward [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1066.42s)]
*  whether that be with your one molecule or your platform. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1070.9s)]
*  You're working on that treatment for HABC I wonder if you could tell me a bit more specifically [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1075.38s)]
*  about that disease and what it is and how common etc. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1081.1s)]
*  HABC is hypermyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1084.86s)]
*  The disease affects a particular protein which is a tubulin, tubulin 4a for short, top 4a [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1090.66s)]
*  and is a leukodystrophy so it affects the white matter of the brain which essentially is the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1099.5s)]
*  Myelination of certain areas of the brain the basal ganglia and cerebellum and the mutations [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1105.1799999999998s)]
*  in the top 4a gene affect the deposition of myelin on nerves within those particular areas [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1111.78s)]
*  which then lead to the symptoms that you see and those symptoms tend to be things like [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1121.1799999999998s)]
*  learning difficulties, motor skills, problems with walking, sitting, eating etc. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1126.82s)]
*  Upper neurone dysfunction, delayed motor development, a number of the patients have things like epilepsy [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1134.86s)]
*  they may require a gastric tube to eat with, a lot of them have motor regression as well [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1141.82s)]
*  and it's neurodegenerative so there's almost a scale of severity and at one end of that scale [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1148.4599999999998s)]
*  you'll have babies that are born and that disease shows up quite quickly and they don't really [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1154.4599999999998s)]
*  get to the point of being able to support themselves and then there's another form of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1161.02s)]
*  the disease where the children actually develop and they then start missing developmental markers [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1166.06s)]
*  and you notice things like their gait has changed or there's certain issues that you start to see [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1173.1s)]
*  and then they start to go downhill and they show more and more problems. It is a very very rare [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1179.58s)]
*  disease it's estimated somewhere between one in 85,000 and one in 150,000 patients so per population [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1185.9s)]
*  I think the really difficult thing with this and with a number of other rare diseases is that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1194.46s)]
*  there isn't huge amounts of research and information out there about how many patients [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1199.42s)]
*  there actually are. We've gone back through the literature and we've seen everything from there [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1205.26s)]
*  are 200 patients worldwide through to it makes up 9% of leucodystrophies which kind of gives an idea [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1210.3799999999999s)]
*  of at least 1600 new births and then you kind of go well the patients live 10-15 years which then [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1217.6599999999999s)]
*  multiplies that up so 16,000 patients worldwide possibly. The research and the funding for the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1225.18s)]
*  research to actually really tell that is just not there yet. I can certainly say that what we found [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1232.3s)]
*  is there's far more in the UK than we ever expected based on the 200 number worldwide [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1238.38s)]
*  and there's a lot of people suffering with this here. There's a lot in Europe as well that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1245.74s)]
*  you know since starting the company have contacted us so I'm pretty sure the numbers are actually [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  higher than what is published. Let me go into the mechanism of the disease a little bit actually [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1257.9s)]
*  because I can move from there into what we're looking at to try and develop a therapy. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1263.9s)]
*  So I mentioned it's mutations in a particular gene, the gene for tubulin and particular [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1269.5800000000002s)]
*  tubulin, tubulin 4a which is found in those specific regions the basal ganglia and cerebellum [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1276.22s)]
*  and what that produces is a abnormal protein and that abnormal protein has a gain of function [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1281.02s)]
*  and what that protein is involved with is it's involved with making parts of the cytoskeleton [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1288.38s)]
*  and with that abnormal structure of the cytoskeleton you don't get proper lipid transport [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1295.3400000000001s)]
*  or protein transport so you don't get full deposition of the proteins and things required [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1301.9s)]
*  for myelin and therefore you don't get the myelin sheath around the you know the nerves and therefore [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1308.38s)]
*  you don't get fast action potentials working properly and the therapy that we are developing [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1313.34s)]
*  involves the I'd say knockout it's the because it's not really a knockout it's not a gene [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1319.5s)]
*  therapy it works at the mRNA level and what it does is it binds to the mRNA and then recruits in [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1324.4599999999998s)]
*  RNA's age which then destroys that particular message and it's a antisense oligonucleotide [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1331.02s)]
*  that we're developing and by knocking out that message other forms of tubulin can then step in [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1337.5s)]
*  and although we don't have the data showing that they step in the hypothesis is that they step in [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1347.74s)]
*  and actually replace the tubulin 4a which then allows normal functioning within those oligonucleotide [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1353.26s)]
*  sites which then allows deposition of myelin. Are there any current treatments? Not really [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1360.62s)]
*  there's nothing really out there that target the disease itself I think you know there are other [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1369.1799999999998s)]
*  people that are working on ways of doing this but there's nothing that's on the market and [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1375.1799999999998s)]
*  nothing that is out there that really targets the cause of the disease the only real treatments [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1378.62s)]
*  are symptomatic and they involve things like physical therapies gastric tubes yeah there's [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1384.54s)]
*  various corrective surgery that can be done to try and help as well various drugs that are you [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1390.8600000000001s)]
*  know there to help with things like motor skills epilepsy etc but it's actually just treatment [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1397.42s)]
*  of symptoms is not targeting the disease. As far as clinical trials goes is it difficult to I mean [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1402.3s)]
*  where are you at with clinical trials first? So we are still in the development phases so we have [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1410.7s)]
*  a number of molecules and some of those molecules look you know very good but there are a number of [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1417.66s)]
*  steps that we need to go through before we can get into the clinical trials we are still developing [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1422.94s)]
*  we've got advice from regulators of what we need to do I think to get to clinical trials is reasonably [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  difficult quite rightly so they're quite stringent things that we need to go through so we need to [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1436.38s)]
*  go through a number of different models for toxicology of course you need to show some [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1442.5400000000002s)]
*  sort of efficacy in models you've got your bio distribution and pharmacokinetics as well [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1447.3400000000001s)]
*  and then on top of that you have to do the manufacturing and make sure that everything [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1454.22s)]
*  is to gmp and correct for treatment so we are right in the middle of doing that at the moment [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1457.98s)]
*  the other side of it is is that you you have the clinical preparation which is really pulling [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1464.94s)]
*  together a protocol and figuring out how to treat the patients how to dose the drug which patients [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1469.26s)]
*  are going to be affected within your trial what to look for I think the the real difficulty here [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1475.66s)]
*  for us is that we can't follow what someone else has done necessarily we can look at other diseases [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1481.66s)]
*  that are similar but no one's really done this disease in clinical trials so we're kind of you [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1488.22s)]
*  know figuring that out right from the very beginning but we are coming up with our protocol [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1494.38s)]
*  and we're talking to a number of key opinion leaders to really get all the information that [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1499.8200000000002s)]
*  we need to be able to do that we always set out right from the very beginning to try and do this [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1504.8600000000001s)]
*  as quickly as we possibly can because we recognize the need to get a treatment out there and with [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1509.5800000000002s)]
*  this and with some of the other extremely rare diseases whether it's pediatric or an adult [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1515.5s)]
*  are the sheer numbers of people that have this condition a barrier to clinical trials because [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1522.22s)]
*  obviously for a for covid you could pick anybody but for this the pool of people that you can [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1529.5s)]
*  have a clinical trial with is very small to start with yeah so this is where the clinical [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1537.74s)]
*  trial design is extremely important and really understanding what you're going to look for [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1543.66s)]
*  you know within those patients is is very important because you are going to go into a [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1550.22s)]
*  clinical trial in a rare disease knowing that recruitment is going to be difficult [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1555.9s)]
*  and recruitment might take a long time if you have a really good design there are a number of [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1560.78s)]
*  regulatory things that allow you to be able to test on smaller numbers of patients and if you [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1566.62s)]
*  have everything set up ready to get a good idea of you know what you're looking for from the trial [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1572.7s)]
*  you can go into some of these trials with lower numbers you can get fast track designations in [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1579.26s)]
*  the states you can move things very quickly but you will probably have to do some follow-on studies [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1584.3799999999999s)]
*  as well and I think that the mechanisms that are put in place to allow you to move quickly through [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1590.06s)]
*  clinical trials also helps with the funding side of things for instance there's you know the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1595.74s)]
*  potential to design something that we could walk into a small number of patients to move towards [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1601.74s)]
*  a very quick VLA that will be conditional on us going out and getting more information from [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1609.5s)]
*  actually treating post VLA which will then allow us to get to the priority review vouchers quicker [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1616.5400000000002s)]
*  which then brings money back in which allows us to do some of those bigger studies there's a [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1623.18s)]
*  number of things out there that help you move forward but at the end of the day you can't do [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1627.74s)]
*  studies where there are hundreds and hundreds of patients because there aren't hundreds of patients [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1633.9s)]
*  out there you've also got to take into consideration the fact that they're paediatric so you they have [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1639.02s)]
*  to get there and back and you know that's going to be very difficult on the families so you've [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1645.98s)]
*  got to make that very you know as easy as possible yeah so there's a lot of things you need to take [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1651.34s)]
*  into consideration but you can do that through a very good design of the study [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1656.3s)]
*  very wide-ranging discussion there and let's hope some of those thousands of rare diseases can be [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF0ZqWgH3Og&t=1665.02s)]
