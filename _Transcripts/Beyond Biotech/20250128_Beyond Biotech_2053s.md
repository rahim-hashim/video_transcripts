*  So our guest today is Kate Yen, CEO of Oron Therapeutics. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=136.0s)]
*  But first, before we talk about your company, maybe you could fill us in a little bit on the journey to that point [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=141.0s)]
*  because you do have an interesting background. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=148.0s)]
*  Definitely. I've always really been interested in research, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=151.0s)]
*  was trying to decide whether I wanted to go to medical school or do basic science research. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=155.0s)]
*  I worked in a lab after college and I really got the bug to truly try to understand the mechanisms of disease [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=160.0s)]
*  and how cells operate to promote cancer or other diseases. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=166.0s)]
*  And so I decided I wanted to go to grad school. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=171.0s)]
*  So I did my PhD at UCLA and I studied transcriptional regulation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=174.0s)]
*  So that's sort of understanding how genes get turned on and turned off in disease states. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=178.0s)]
*  But it was very cell specific and I was really wanting to be more broad and apply my science [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=183.0s)]
*  from a translational perspective into helping patients. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=189.0s)]
*  And so I moved into a lab at UCLA to do my postdoc where I was working with Charles Sawyers there [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=193.0s)]
*  and I developed a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=200.0s)]
*  So overexpressed to specific gene in the mouse prostate, and then those animals came down with cancer [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=204.0s)]
*  and then trying to understand how the mechanisms by which that gene drove the tumors [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=211.0s)]
*  and then how we could think about treating those tumors to help patients. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=217.0s)]
*  And so from there, I really wanted to get into drug discovery and applying my understanding of basic science. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=222.0s)]
*  So I moved to Merck, worked there for a few years, really applying and understanding the mechanism of drug discovery [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=229.0s)]
*  and how drugs are developed for cancer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=236.0s)]
*  But I was really missing kind of that deep mechanistic understanding. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=239.0s)]
*  And so I was recruited to Audios Pharmaceuticals where I worked for almost 10 years [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=244.0s)]
*  and I led the translational biology team for the lead program of the company, which is called IDH Mutations. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=250.0s)]
*  And there I was able to decipher the mechanism by which these mutations were promoting tumors [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=257.0s)]
*  in acute myeloid leukemias, as well as in solid tumors such as chondrosocoma, flangiocarcinomas, and low-grade gliomas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=264.0s)]
*  And really interestingly, the biology is not what we had expected. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=272.0s)]
*  These mutations were able to cause a block in differentiation or maturation of normal cells. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=276.0s)]
*  So basically the mutation was causing proliferation of early progenitor cells that were forming the tumor. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=284.0s)]
*  And when we inhibited those mutations, we were able to push terminal differentiation or push the cell state, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=291.0s)]
*  which caused the tumor cells to mature and stop dividing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=298.0s)]
*  And so I was really interested by this mechanism. We developed three drugs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=302.0s)]
*  Three drugs have now been approved based on this mechanism, which I'm really excited about. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=306.0s)]
*  But the company had, Audios had taken off in a more clinical, late stage clinical, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=311.0s)]
*  and I was kind of wanting to go back and how could you apply this mechanism to other disease indications? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=316.0s)]
*  But I couldn't find any companies that were doing this. So I got the bug. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=322.0s)]
*  I had a really great mentor there who was talking to me and he said, look, go start your own company. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=326.0s)]
*  And I thought that was like completely insane. I'm a molecular biologist by training. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=332.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm a deep thinking scientist, so that to me seemed quite foreign. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=337.0s)]
*  But he connected me to WilmerHale, which is a huge corporate law firm. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=342.0s)]
*  And they had this program called Quick Start, where they're willing to take entrepreneurs with really interesting ideas [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=347.0s)]
*  and provide legal advice and help for incorporation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=354.0s)]
*  And then you pay them back later if you get successful. So I did that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=359.0s)]
*  I incorporated the company and I went out and raised about a million and a half dollars from friends and family [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=364.0s)]
*  just to try and identify other genes or pathways that could be causing tumor cells to prevent their differentiation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=370.0s)]
*  And I was able to bring in some computational biology expertise into the company with that money [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=378.0s)]
*  and do some really early biology and computational biology to help us identify early targets. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=386.0s)]
*  With that friends and family round of financing, we got a little bit of traction, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=392.0s)]
*  started the very like baby form of our platform, but it was enough to get real venture capitalists interested in what I was doing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=397.0s)]
*  So with that, I went out and I raised a seed financing of around nine and a half million dollars from professional venture capitalists, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=405.0s)]
*  which then allowed us to really incorporate and build out our computational machine learning, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=413.0s)]
*  AI platform, which is really the heart of the company and allows us to identify the pathways that are driving this block and differentiation in tumor cells. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=419.0s)]
*  So from there, we continued to build out our drug discovery capabilities and our basic science. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=430.0s)]
*  We've now from the growth of a company from the seed, we were able to raise a series A financing in July of 22 with about 48 million dollars. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=437.0s)]
*  And that has continued to allow us to build the platform and then build out our pipeline of drug targets. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=447.0s)]
*  And now we're about to file an I&D for our lead program in December of this year and go to the clinic and begin treating patients. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=453.0s)]
*  And I'm really excited about that opportunity. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=461.0s)]
*  When you started your company, obviously, science is your background. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=464.0s)]
*  Was it kind of daunting in a way having to do all of the other things involved with running a company like hiring and the legal stuff? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=469.0s)]
*  And just it's just so much more than what you were initially focused on. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=478.0s)]
*  Yes, you're absolutely right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=483.0s)]
*  I was really fortunate at my time at Adios when I joined Adios, I was the 11th employee. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=485.0s)]
*  And for about two years, we only had 20 people at the company. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=490.0s)]
*  And so in early biotech, you get exposure to all parts of the business, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=494.0s)]
*  The deep science, but you also get to see the business and the decisions and you get to kind of overview, get a roadmap of how a company, a biotech gets built. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=499.0s)]
*  So I had that experience. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=509.0s)]
*  Yes, my job there was focused in the biology, but I got exposed to all the other. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=511.0s)]
*  And then I've always felt that it's very important to build out your network and collaborate with folks. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=516.0s)]
*  And so when I started the company, of course, I don't have the business background. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=522.0s)]
*  So I went back and started pulling my network in and people who I know have business experience who can come in and advise me, people with legal experience, business experience, hiring, HR, all those pieces that have to come together for the company. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=526.0s)]
*  So I really tapped into my friends there as well and utilize them to help build out the group. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=542.0s)]
*  You already mentioned some of the things that you're doing at the company. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=549.0s)]
*  I wonder if you could go into a bit more detail about the diseases that you're taking on and the drugs you're developing and the mechanisms of action. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=552.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So our lead program is the development candidate is called a UTX 703. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=560.0s)]
*  And this is the molecule that we will be filing to enter clinical trials next year in early Q1. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=568.0s)]
*  This drug targets a particular protein called Cat2A. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=576.0s)]
*  And this is a protein that during normal development is on an early stem and progenitor cells. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=580.0s)]
*  But as normal cells terminally differentiate, it gets shut off. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=587.0s)]
*  But cancer cells are smart. And what they've done is they've gone back and they figured out ways to hijack developmental biology pathways that promote this proliferation and plasticity that causes very aggressive cancers. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=591.0s)]
*  And so the cancer cells re-upregulate this gene Cat2A to keep the cells in this de-differentiated more embryonic cell state. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=605.0s)]
*  And so our computational platform that we've built, Origin, we took in large multiomic big data sets and did computational comparisons between cancers of a particular cell type. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=614.0s)]
*  In this case, we started with acute myeloid leukemia. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=627.0s)]
*  We mapped them to our normal developmental biology atlas to understand where those tumor cells were blocked in the differentiation cascade. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=630.0s)]
*  And Cat2A rose to the top as one of the genes that is regulating the differential gene expression between tumor cells, AML tumor cells and normal hematopoietic cells that do not have a block in differentiation. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=638.0s)]
*  So those were the first tumor types that we identified. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=653.0s)]
*  And then we did some initial genetic knockdown of the target and then pharmacologic degradation of the target to show that when we change the expression or decrease the expression of Cat2A in the tumor cells, it causes those tumor cells to terminally differentiate and stop dividing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=657.0s)]
*  And so that mechanism is very analogous to the mechanism of the drugs that I developed when I was at Adios. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=675.0s)]
*  At Adios, we were targeting IDH mutations, which cause a block in differentiation, and the drugs reduce that block and allow cells to terminally differentiate. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=683.0s)]
*  That led to clinical benefit and approvals for patients. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=692.0s)]
*  And now in a different set of AML patients with very specific features, treatment with Cat2A can also promote differentiation. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=696.0s)]
*  Cat2A degraders can promote differentiation and lead to an inhibition of growth and clinical benefit in preclinical models. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=705.0s)]
*  Now we're going to go and do the clinical test. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=713.0s)]
*  Are there other things in the pipeline? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=716.0s)]
*  Yep. So we have a second program. The first one, Cat2A is public. We've disclosed that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=718.0s)]
*  Our second program is also targeting solid tumors. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=723.0s)]
*  We have biological validation in solid epithelial cancers as well as neuroendocrine cancers. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=727.0s)]
*  And we've been pushing our chemistry drug discovery efforts and we're about to enter lead optimization, which allows you to really push towards a development candidate to take into the clinic. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=735.0s)]
*  I should mention that our Cat2A program not only works in acute myeloid leukemias, but from our platform, we've also identified that small cell lung cancers as well as neuroendocrine prostate cancer, solid tumors, are also susceptible to Cat2A degradation. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=746.0s)]
*  So our phase one clinical trials for the Cat2A program will be done in AML, small cell lung cancer, and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=761.0s)]
*  When do you think that you'll have data from those? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=772.0s)]
*  We plan to file the IND in December of this year, get clearance in January timeframe, and then have first patient in by the end of the first quarter of next year. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=776.0s)]
*  And then it will probably be about a year, year and a half, probably a year and a half before we get clinical readout from our phase one trials. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=786.0s)]
*  We'll know from the data that's generated in the trials, whether phase one trials, whether or not we have clinical proof of concept for this mechanism and this target. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=793.0s)]
*  And then if that's the case, that will then trigger further downstream development for approval in these disease indications. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=802.0s)]
*  You mentioned all the support that you had getting to this point. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=809.0s)]
*  Were there a lot of other female biotech CEOs at the time that you were setting up and were there any specific challenges to being female and leading a company? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=814.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, when I first started the company, I wasn't even thinking about being female or male. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=827.0s)]
*  I just was going to drive the company. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=832.0s)]
*  But actually, you know, as I've grown into the role and as I've, you know, continued to build out my network, you know, now from a more business and C-suite perspective, you know, I have really been fortunate enough to meet a lot of other women CEOs. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=834.0s)]
*  And we have actually a very strong network of group. That's called the CEO Sisterhood. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=850.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard of it, but it's about 60 female CEOs across the US and Europe that get together and have this inside network where we can actually ping each other for advice, ask for help. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=855.0s)]
*  We can, you know, think through some more early CEOs, first time CEOs, get exposure to CEOs that have done it two or three times so they can help, you know, mentor some of the more junior folks like myself. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=870.0s)]
*  And honestly, that group has been phenomenal to me as well as everybody else. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=883.0s)]
*  And we have a yearly retreat and then a Slack channel that we all communicate with each other. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=888.0s)]
*  And the mission really is to be a network of advisors and then pay it forward to people as you learn. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=893.0s)]
*  Does that extend below the CEO level to other positions? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=901.0s)]
*  So this group is particularly focused in female CEOs, but there have been other groups that have started from different disciplines. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=906.0s)]
*  I know they're building one from a finance perspective, the CFOs, also from CMOs. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=915.0s)]
*  But I do think that part of this goal is not only just the mechanics of running a company, it's about how do you learn and leadership styles and how do you apply that leadership and how do you apply it throughout your organization as well. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=920.0s)]
*  So the things that I take away from this, I apply to my team here, right. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=934.0s)]
*  And I try that out. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=938.0s)]
*  So I do think that there's other smaller networks for women that maybe not be the CEO suite. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=940.0s)]
*  But for sure, I think that this one is quite special. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=946.0s)]
*  Obviously, you can draw upon others for their positive experiences and their help. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=949.0s)]
*  Have you been able to assist in other areas, too? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=954.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=958.0s)]
*  So I think from my perspective, things that I'm happening or dealing with in my company at my particular stage, I have friends. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=959.0s)]
*  We have a smaller within that big group. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=967.0s)]
*  We have small little four or five women groups that get together and really get into the weeds with each other about what I'm seeing, how I can apply it, how I've dealt with a certain scenario. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=969.0s)]
*  I give that information to people as they need it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=981.0s)]
*  And then obviously, you know, take back from them experiences. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=984.0s)]
*  They may be at a farther stage in their company development, and that's not a place I've been yet. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=988.0s)]
*  So really gathering their expertise and using it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=992.0s)]
*  But the whole premise is really to take your knowledge and pay it forward. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=995.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the beauties of women and how we work together is that, you know, women come together as a community and think about how we can work as a team to make the whole better. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=999.0s)]
*  Have there been any challenges specifically gender related? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1011.0s)]
*  For me, moving into the boardroom and being a CEO, like I didn't start my career to do this, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1015.0s)]
*  You know, I ended up here based on my entrepreneurship. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1022.0s)]
*  But I do think that the times are changing as to how boardrooms interact and how people run companies and the style with which they do it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1025.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, women sometimes have a more or just a different approach to leadership. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1037.0s)]
*  And that can sometimes be a challenge when you have people that are more used to the old school. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1043.0s)]
*  But I do think people are open and thinking about, you know, as long as you're able to deliver and are transparent and moving forward with the company, people are willing to let you lead in your style. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1048.0s)]
*  Is there more diversity, I guess, in the boardroom and the workplace since you started running the company? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1061.0s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely think so. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1067.0s)]
*  Even over the last like four or five years, I think, you know, more women are coming into the boardroom, getting CEO roles and being able to influence their style of leadership. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1069.0s)]
*  And we see this at conferences. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1080.0s)]
*  There's still a long way to go, though. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1083.0s)]
*  I mean, you can go to these banking conferences and you'll see maybe 10% of the companies that are represented there are women CEOs and the rest are all male. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1085.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1094.0s)]
*  And so there's definitely room to grow and improve. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1095.0s)]
*  But I think it is starting to take a turn. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1099.0s)]
*  And I also think that people are beginning to see that this leadership style that women can come to the table with is effective. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1102.0s)]
*  And the more chances women get to be able to approve that, I think it'll just, you know, help the diversity as it expands and downstream. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1109.0s)]
*  When I've been to cover various events and conferences, it was, I would say, predominantly older white males. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1129.0s)]
*  And it seems to have changed a little, but not much. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1130.0s)]
*  I wonder, is there anything that maybe is holding that evolution back? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1135.0s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1141.0s)]
*  We are trying to break in and I think it started and I think the downturn in the markets has not helped anything, especially in biotech, because it's made a very challenging to grow anything in biotech at the moment. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1142.0s)]
*  But I do think you're right. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1153.0s)]
*  You know, there are still some investors that are, you know, when they think about it, they want to have an older white male sitting next to you in the boardroom. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1156.0s)]
*  They feel comfortable, more comfortable with that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1165.0s)]
*  I think that we will break that mold as success stories come out and continue to evolve. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1168.0s)]
*  And I think, but like I said, there's definitely more work that needs to be done. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1175.0s)]
*  It seems strange as well in terms of getting the message across. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1180.0s)]
*  I went to an event in Sweden where it was probably 20 to 30 percent women. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1184.0s)]
*  And of course, this isn't all at the CEO level, but there was a session on women in biotech. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1190.0s)]
*  And I thought this this was a really good opportunity for people to learn about this. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1197.0s)]
*  And when I went into that session, it was probably 95 percent female. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1202.0s)]
*  So it was almost as if it was preaching to the converted, I guess. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1208.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1212.0s)]
*  And so I would have hoped that more men would have been in there to learn more about women in the workplace. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1213.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I agree. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1221.0s)]
*  I think that's that's one of the biggest challenges. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1222.0s)]
*  Right. And there's a lot of exciting biotech out there right now. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1225.0s)]
*  And like I said, in the backdrop of these hard markets at the moment, you know, every company is kind of hunkering down, trying to make ends meet and make it winter through this storm. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1229.0s)]
*  But, you know, I do think there's a lot of great female CEOs leading great companies. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1241.0s)]
*  And I think when the market opens back up, we're going to see a lot of that kind of flourish. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1246.0s)]
*  And I think hopefully that will begin to open people's eyes to the leadership styles of women and how they work together can bring real value to companies. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1252.0s)]
*  About time, too. I think I definitely need that evolution. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1263.0s)]
*  Does that extend to and I do you see any change or improvement in the hiring of minorities, you know, Hispanic population, African-Americans, because that also seems to be underrepresented? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1267.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that is absolutely true. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1281.0s)]
*  That is very underrepresented. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1283.0s)]
*  And I think that is probably the next area that needs to get tackled. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1285.0s)]
*  And I think it probably starts much earlier and sort of access to, you know, STEM education and schools that teach science and get kids from an early age really excited about this type of work. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1290.0s)]
*  Right. And exposed to these types of work. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1304.0s)]
*  And hopefully, I think, you know, the schools, they're starting to do that. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1307.0s)]
*  My three boys, my youngest is a senior in high school at the moment, and I see what they're learning in school now. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1310.0s)]
*  And it's really exciting. And I think they're getting exposed to a lot more of these opportunities. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1316.0s)]
*  And I think hopefully that helps to bring in more diversity. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1321.0s)]
*  And I think that just having more people like yourself in positions that you're in, it gives opportunities and gives hope that maybe this is something that I could do if you were a young girl in science that maybe doesn't see that path ahead, but now has that option. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1325.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I think, you know, I started this company right before COVID hit. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1345.0s)]
*  And, you know, then I started out in my house. I was working in my kitchen and, you know, we were home. I had three boys in high school and middle school. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1349.0s)]
*  And they were watching me build this company. And it's really exciting to see them see me do this. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1357.0s)]
*  Right. And I think it's empowering to them. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1365.0s)]
*  My son, he's now in college and he just took a biology test the other day and he told me he wore his Oron t-shirt to the test to give him good brain power. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1368.0s)]
*  Made me feel proud. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1377.0s)]
*  Obviously, geography seems to play a part as well. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1379.0s)]
*  If you were in, I don't know, the Midwest or some places where biotech isn't really an option, is there a way to kind of reach out to women in science in those areas to try and get them into maybe some of the hubs? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1383.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I think there is a real big push. Part of the way biotech has been able to work is there's a lot of outsourcing of work to different contract research organizations. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1400.0s)]
*  So you don't have to build these big internal labs. The biotechs tend to be hubbed in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles areas. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1411.0s)]
*  But you're right. There's a lot of talent in the Midwest that is not tapped into. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1419.0s)]
*  I think a lot of that comes again through education. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1424.0s)]
*  And then there is a push now to begin to onshore a lot of these contract research organizations, which have been farmed out overseas and to really bring a lot of this technology and development and companies back to the U.S. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1427.0s)]
*  where we can then employ people to help us build out these companies. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1441.0s)]
*  There is always a hardship to do this in these really expensive areas that cost a ton of money for real estate. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1446.0s)]
*  And so folks are talking about building more of these contract research organizations in the Midwest next to big universities so that you can pull from that talent pool and then provide opportunities there. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1453.0s)]
*  And I think you're absolutely right. We'll begin to get a lot more diversity as you begin to get insight in populations from different areas of the U.S. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1465.0s)]
*  It's easy if you're in Boston and you have a company in Boston or you work in Boston. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1473.0s)]
*  But if you lived in, I don't know, Louisiana and you like it there, there's no opportunity there. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1479.0s)]
*  It's difficult to expect or anticipate anybody to move from maybe even a rural part of North Dakota where house prices are cheap. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1486.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're looking at 20 times the cost to move to Boston. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1497.0s)]
*  So I guess it's a consideration. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1502.0s)]
*  The other part of that, you're absolutely right. The other part of that is that if there's anything that came out of COVID and us living that way, we've learned to work remotely. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1505.0s)]
*  Right. And we've learned that it can work. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1513.0s)]
*  And so I have employees that don't live in Boston and they live remotely and they work for us and it works just fine. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1515.0s)]
*  Right. And so I think that opens up another avenue so you don't have to physically relocate to these hubs. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1523.0s)]
*  You can actually work from a remote place. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1530.0s)]
*  I mean, if you need to be in a lab, that makes it a little bit harder. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1533.0s)]
*  But there's lots of jobs within a biotech company that you don't need to be in a particular lab to do. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1535.0s)]
*  How do you see the evolution, I guess, of biotech company diversity in terms of employees and CEOs? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1541.0s)]
*  Does it start by going to the elementary schools and starting there? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1550.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1554.0s)]
*  I think it starts from the early stages of education and really giving kids an opportunity to see data, I think, and how big data and how you can apply this type of data to basic scientific questions and problems. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1556.0s)]
*  And every kid now in America is addicted to their phones just like every adult. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1572.0s)]
*  Right. So they see the power of what they can do. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1576.0s)]
*  And those phones aren't created like magic. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1579.0s)]
*  You know, they have to come from technology and advancements and science. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1582.0s)]
*  And so teaching kids about computers and math and biology and chemistry early on and getting them excited about being part of that exploration of new and advanced technology is really critical. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1585.0s)]
*  That's really the beauty of Oron is that, you know, we're taking this high technology computer computational AI machine learning algorithms to help us process these huge data sets that are being generated out of patient samples or biological model systems. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1600.0s)]
*  And one person can't crunch all those numbers. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1618.0s)]
*  So you have to have this interplay between data science and physical science so that you can actually make advances. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1621.0s)]
*  And I hope that that is something you're learning. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1630.0s)]
*  They're learning it more at the college level and they're learning how the biology and science and chemistry works. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1633.0s)]
*  They do need to bring in this technology piece. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1639.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of programming and computers that's starting early, but making that link will be critical. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1642.0s)]
*  How important is AI been to your company? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1648.0s)]
*  It's very important because, you know, we have a whole data science team that really helps us process this information. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1651.0s)]
*  Like I'm a biologist by training. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1658.0s)]
*  I speak a biology language. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1660.0s)]
*  We have computational data scientists who speak math and computation. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1662.0s)]
*  And so the trick is how do we learn to speak each other's language so that we can make scientific advancements, right? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1668.0s)]
*  Utilize their expertise to be able to come up with biological problems. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1675.0s)]
*  And then they utilize our understanding of the biology so they could apply it to the models that they're building as well. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1680.0s)]
*  And that has really been the core sauce, special sauce, if you will, of Oron is that from day one, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1687.0s)]
*  we really brought those two disciplines together and made sure that we were working hand in hand as we identify and discover new targets for drug discovery. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1694.0s)]
*  And I guess that now we've moved into this era of AI. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1704.0s)]
*  The next big question seems to be how sustainable AI is. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1708.0s)]
*  I mean, it goes to it's kind of an interesting problem, right? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1713.0s)]
*  I mean, everything is a system, right? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1716.0s)]
*  A system biology like one perturbation leads to multiple perturbations and one change leads to different changes. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1718.0s)]
*  So you have to think about it as the whole, right? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1725.0s)]
*  Not just an individual part. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1728.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that I, as a woman, I like to look at as a leader, right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1730.0s)]
*  I look at the whole organization and how as an organization, what are we trying to accomplish? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1735.0s)]
*  And then individual parts of that organization, how do they function? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1741.0s)]
*  And but how do they feed back to the whole of the company? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1745.0s)]
*  And, you know, my style of leadership is also in that vein. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1749.0s)]
*  Sometimes you have to take one on the chin for the greater good, right? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1753.0s)]
*  Because, you know, it might be a loss for the initial piece or you might give up something initially, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1756.0s)]
*  but you get something much better in the long run. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1762.0s)]
*  And I think women are pretty good at doing that. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1765.0s)]
*  They learn how to see the greater good. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1768.0s)]
*  And I hope that that can be celebrated and fostered as more female CEOs come in and really drive success in their companies. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1771.0s)]
*  You know, we don't we only have 20 people at our company. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1780.0s)]
*  This is we're a very small little lean company. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1783.0s)]
*  And I really like that because we don't have layers of bureaucracy. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1786.0s)]
*  So you don't have politicians selling you something up the chain. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1790.0s)]
*  And you also have people around the table that everybody's very educated and very smart and can follow the logic of what you're doing. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1794.0s)]
*  You may not be a domain expert, but those people actually ask a really critical questions to someone who is a domain expert [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1802.0s)]
*  because that naive question to someone who's in their own myopic weeds can really make that person step back and see it from a different perspective. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1809.0s)]
*  And that's where I think you get growth and you get advances that are aha moments that allow you to really take things to the next level. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1818.0s)]
*  But I think that a part of that is having the leadership, the ability to foster and create and nurture that kind of environment where people don't feel stupid asking that question. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1826.0s)]
*  Nope, nope. That was the biggest learning for me. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1838.0s)]
*  I know is you're taught in science, you're very rigorous, everything's challenged and you're getting up and people fire questions at you and you have to be able to defend your point of view and your thoughts and your science and give all the data to support your ideas. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1841.0s)]
*  And you're right. Like a lot of people are afraid to say something they don't want to look stupid in front of the group. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1854.0s)]
*  But for me, the moment I learned to let go of that and be like, wait a minute, I'm not really sure I follow what you're saying. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1859.0s)]
*  That was where I was able to take my thinking to the next level. And that's really what I try to foster here at Oron. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1865.0s)]
*  And I think it's paid off. I mean, you know, very small amount of time with relatively little money. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1873.0s)]
*  I mean, we're we've raised very small dollars compared to some of these big, huge companies. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1878.0s)]
*  And we are already headed to the clinic and filing our first I&D. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1883.0s)]
*  So I'm really proud of this team and the work that they've done. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1888.0s)]
*  How do you see the evolution of your company in the short and medium term? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1891.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the first, you know, sort of acute evolution will be we're going to become a clinical organization, which is, you know, a big change. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1895.0s)]
*  We've been a preclinical organization and now we're going to bring on the clinical teams and, you know, those are going to drive a lot of the work that happens. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1904.0s)]
*  And so that's going to be something that the company is going to have to adjust to. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1912.0s)]
*  But the other part is, is that I think, you know, we've built this really exciting platform to look at and identify targets for oncology. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1917.0s)]
*  But I think that this platform we've built could also be the framework to help identify drug targets outside of oncology as well, where changes in cell state are leading to disease. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1925.0s)]
*  Examples of that are inflammation and immunology and cardiovascular disease. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1935.0s)]
*  All of these areas are untapped potential for our platform. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1941.0s)]
*  And so we're beginning to think about expanding our capabilities outside of oncology as well. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1945.0s)]
*  But one step at a time. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1951.0s)]
*  Some great information there from Kate, not only on Oron, but also on the many challenges and opportunities associated with running a biotech company. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLLmvHCFABs&t=1959.0s)]
