# The biotech investment landscape in 2024
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 91. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Connell and this is the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=14.96s)]
*  Amazingly 2024 is almost a third of the way through. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=19.68s)]
*  So what better time to take a look at the current situation surrounding biotech funding? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=24.56s)]
*  To give us an overview of the venture capital space currently is Stephanie Soroda, Chief [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Business Officer of RTW Investments. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=36.08s)]
*  RTW is a global multi-strategy investment firm focused on supporting innovative biotech [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=39.28s)]
*  and biopharma companies in the US, Europe and China. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=46.04s)]
*  RTW invests in public and private companies across their entire lifecycle with a focus [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=50.64s)]
*  on those addressing next generation gene and RNA therapies, rare diseases, targeted oncological, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  cardiovascular and neurological disorders and more. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=63.08s)]
*  So first I asked Stephanie for some background on the company. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=67.02000000000001s)]
*  RTW is a $7 billion full lifecycle investment firm focused on the most innovative sectors [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=72.52s)]
*  across biotechnology and medtech. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=80.84s)]
*  Our business has been around since 2009. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=84.08s)]
*  So we're in year 15 of our existence. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=87.72s)]
*  We are one of the largest specialist investors in the space. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=90.6s)]
*  We have a global presence. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=94.56s)]
*  So we're headquartered in New York, but we have offices in London and Shanghai. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=97.36s)]
*  In addition to being full lifecycle, so what that means is actually our business started [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=102.88s)]
*  in the public space. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  We invested in publicly listed companies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=109.32s)]
*  It was pretty straightforward, long, short equity. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=112.94s)]
*  About eight, nine years ago, together with a few other specialist investors, we started [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=116.74s)]
*  investing in late stage privates and pre IPO rounds. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=122.82s)]
*  And we built that crossover ecosystem. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  And the irony is that we were able to do it with not that much capital. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=130.18s)]
*  Maybe there was double digit, billion dollars collectively that really displaced the traditional [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=134.73999999999998s)]
*  funders to those late stage privates and to those IPO rounds. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  So I think as companies and management teams got smarter around who should be supporting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=145.1s)]
*  their company as they move into the public arena, it became clear that the specialist [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=151.54s)]
*  investor who had a public business could continue to support those companies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=158.14s)]
*  So that was kind of how the crossover ecosystem and biotech evolved. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=162.74s)]
*  And we were one of the leaders in that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=167.82s)]
*  From there, we also tried our hand at going even earlier and we started a company. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=169.78s)]
*  So the first new co that we formed today is one of the largest publicly traded gene therapy [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  companies. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=181.86s)]
*  It's called Rocket Pharma. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=182.86s)]
*  We started that in our back conference room with the idea that there were a lot of very [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  interesting assets that were moving through academic hands, ready to go into human clinical [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  trials and needed more capital and someone to kind of drive those programs forward out [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=196.8s)]
*  of academia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  So we licensed a bunch of interesting assets from academic centers around the world and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=203.78s)]
*  we started Rocket. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=210.74s)]
*  So that's kind of our full life cycle. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=212.74s)]
*  We do everything from start companies to late stage publicly traded commercial enterprises. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=214.38s)]
*  In addition to that, we also try to think of ourselves as being supportive investors. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=220.86s)]
*  And sometimes that means that you need to do more than just be a passive provider of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=225.98s)]
*  capital, but to do other things to support companies to get over the hurdles that they're [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=231.14s)]
*  facing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  So we also do things like royalty financing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  We're doing more and more royalty financings, synthetic royalties. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=239.5s)]
*  I can explain what that is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=244.18s)]
*  We do licensing agreements. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=245.94s)]
*  We have done a couple of specs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=247.98s)]
*  So we try to think of ways that we can improve a company's likelihood of getting their assets [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=250.26s)]
*  in the right space and well capitalized. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=255.74s)]
*  What kind of biotech companies and disease areas do you look to fund or does it vary? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=258.3s)]
*  It varies. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=264.26s)]
*  So innovation is accelerating and we decided that the way that we would approach the space. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=265.26s)]
*  So we have always been very deeply fundamentally oriented and very science led. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=272.74s)]
*  So it's incredibly important to our process, first of all, to be completely familiar and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=279.74s)]
*  behind the science. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=287.06s)]
*  That has to make sense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  And then of course we marry that with more of a traditional almost Warren Buffett like [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  framework for evaluating the valuation of a company. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=294.38s)]
*  But then we also take into consideration the competitive landscape. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=298.3s)]
*  I would say that our favorite investment is where we identify an asset that we believe [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=302.82s)]
*  is going to have a meaningful transformational effect, not just a short term momentum driven [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=310.3s)]
*  step up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=317.58s)]
*  But we're looking for things where we can get multiples of return because we're identifying [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=318.58s)]
*  value before the rest of the market has identified that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=323.62s)]
*  I have been at RTW for 12 years now and during this last dozen years we have tripled the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=327.42s)]
*  number of modalities that can address diseases. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=335.74s)]
*  So it's not just small molecules and antibodies, but we have gene replacement therapy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=339.26s)]
*  We have gene editing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=346.26s)]
*  We have antibody drug conjugates. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=347.58s)]
*  We have protein degraders. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=349.94s)]
*  There are so many, there's radio pharma. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=351.18s)]
*  So even within oncology, like there are a number of new ways to approach outside of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=353.34s)]
*  just small molecules or immunoncology. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=357.58s)]
*  There's by specifics. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  So there are so many ways to address diseases. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=361.56s)]
*  So we definitely follow the advancements in modalities, but then we also look across disease [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=363.92s)]
*  areas and look across therapeutic areas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=372.18s)]
*  So these days we're very excited about metabolic and obesity and some of the adjacencies like [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=375.5s)]
*  liver diseases. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=381.42s)]
*  We've been big investors in immunology and inflammatory diseases. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=382.42s)]
*  We spend a lot of time in oncology. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=387.46s)]
*  Rare diseases are also bread and butter to us, cardiovascular, neurology and psychiatric [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=389.9s)]
*  diseases. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=396.5s)]
*  So we're covering everything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=397.5s)]
*  We've grown our team to have those subspecialists across these therapeutic areas. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=399.5s)]
*  What does the evaluation process look like when it comes to working with companies? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=406.02s)]
*  I mean, do they come to you? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=410.98s)]
*  Do you go to them? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=412.22s)]
*  No, that's a great question. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=413.22s)]
*  And part of the reason that we do cover so many key areas is that not everything is necessarily [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=415.18s)]
*  investable. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=422.98s)]
*  For example, there has been a lot of advancement in the brain. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=424.54s)]
*  And if we spoke six years ago, I would have said, well, there's really nothing in Alzheimer's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  or there's nothing exciting that we're invested in today. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=435.82s)]
*  But what's really important is to have your foot in the door and to look at the research. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=440.54s)]
*  And so you can track the development and you can see when meaningful things happen, when [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  there is a change, then you're ready to say, like, right, we understand that there's now [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=454.46s)]
*  going to be a sea changer. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  This is opening up a tremendous opportunity. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=460.9s)]
*  Now we see a potential pathway for the science project to actually become a meaningful drug [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=462.97999999999996s)]
*  to patients. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  So our process really starts with data collection. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=471.46s)]
*  We even have a team that supports the research team and that supporting team is called Omni, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=475.82s)]
*  short for Omniscient. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=481.58s)]
*  And together, we probably attend in person and also remotely over 200 medical conferences [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  a year. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=490.74s)]
*  And that is critically important to our process because we need to have that primary [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=491.46s)]
*  scientific data. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=497.62s)]
*  So over the years, we've built a library of primary scientific data that is extremely [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=498.9s)]
*  large and we think rivals what a Pfizer's library would look like. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=505.02s)]
*  How hands on do you get with the companies that you fund or does that vary too? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=511.78s)]
*  It varies. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=517.1s)]
*  So in an example of getting comfortable with a disease area and following the landscape, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  it depends how mature those assets are that we're looking at. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=526.9s)]
*  Are we looking at a disease that is being worked on by two public companies or is it [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=530.9s)]
*  being worked on by two academic centers? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=536.42s)]
*  How mature is it? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=540.14s)]
*  What is their proof of concept? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=541.74s)]
*  Is it a competitive situation? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=543.86s)]
*  Is this first in class? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=546.06s)]
*  We tend to generally stay away from crowded areas. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=548.14s)]
*  We try to stay away from me too opportunities and we really look for drugs that we think [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=552.62s)]
*  are going to be blazing and disrupting that current standard of care or bringing a new [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=558.54s)]
*  standard of care about. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=565.02s)]
*  So it could be anything. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=566.8199999999999s)]
*  And our level of involvement is going to be determined based on the need. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=569.34s)]
*  If something is already in a public company and that public company is fine and has a [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=574.62s)]
*  sophisticated management team, we will, for the most part, be just a passive investor. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=581.58s)]
*  And that, I would say, is the majority of our investments. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  But one example is a company called Argenics, which is over a $20 billion market cap today, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=589.5400000000001s)]
*  one of the leaders in I&I. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=595.54s)]
*  And they had a breakthrough, this sort of pipeline in a pill for autoimmune disorders. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=597.74s)]
*  And we started invest, it's a Belgian company, and we started investing in Argenics when [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=602.06s)]
*  it was in the $300 million market cap range. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=607.3s)]
*  And it was trading on the Netherlands Stock Exchange. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=610.66s)]
*  And one of the conversations that our founder and chief investment officer, Rob Long, had [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=612.98s)]
*  with their CEO was about dual listing and doing that so that they could tap into the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=618.22s)]
*  capital here in the US. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=626.7s)]
*  They did. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=628.4200000000001s)]
*  And companies had a great run. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  But that's an example of something that we've been invested in for a very long time and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=632.02s)]
*  had some influence and some sort of, I would say, meaningful dialogue, not just because [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=637.94s)]
*  the years of investment, but from the beginning, sort of shared our thoughts on how they could [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  improve. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=649.2199999999999s)]
*  Now, there are examples where we get involved with mid-stage venture. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=650.2199999999999s)]
*  And obviously, in the company creation, we are heavily involved. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=656.42s)]
*  We start the company, then we own the majority of it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=660.0999999999999s)]
*  And we sort of handpick the leadership team and the managers for that company. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=663.62s)]
*  But even in an existing company, if we decide to sort of lead a private round, then we may [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=669.78s)]
*  have one of our analysts who's leading the work on those investments take a board seat [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=675.38s)]
*  or a board observer role. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=681.98s)]
*  Generally, we will give up those board seats once a company goes public. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=684.14s)]
*  So we don't have the restrictions of being an insider. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=689.3399999999999s)]
*  But in some cases, we do take that insider. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=692.78s)]
*  A lot of companies that you talk to when you go to events, maybe it's different for you, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=696.34s)]
*  but some of the CEOs that you talk to mention funding as being one of the biggest challenges. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=701.66s)]
*  Is there anything that companies can maybe do to help that? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=708.66s)]
*  Or I know that the down market probably affected a lot of things. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=713.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=718.98s)]
*  So funding is a huge topic of conversation these days. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=719.78s)]
*  It was not just the down market that impacted the funding environment. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=723.54s)]
*  If you go back to two years before that were exceptional and it was very easy for companies [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=727.6999999999999s)]
*  to go to IPO and to get a very rich step up to their last round. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=735.3s)]
*  And we saw a lot of companies go public pretty early, even earlier than they normally do. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=741.66s)]
*  So you had preclinical companies in that public sphere. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  And when you have a market downturn, particularly one that lasts as long as this last two year, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=752.9399999999999s)]
*  10 month bear market that we just went through, the competition for capital is fierce. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=760.06s)]
*  Generalist investors exit the space. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=765.66s)]
*  And then you're left with specialists like ourselves who have to really be intentional [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=768.14s)]
*  about which companies we want to fund. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=776.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, in that sort of competition for capital, not everyone is going to be able [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=778.62s)]
*  to get to the same size check. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=783.82s)]
*  And I know that we were pretty disciplined and ended up cutting a number of positions [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=785.34s)]
*  and sort of re-concentrating in our favorite names. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=791.5s)]
*  So the environment today is better, but we're still seeing the lack of capital from the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=794.3s)]
*  generalist investors. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=803.1s)]
*  So we know that specialists like us have the burden of doing a lot of the funding. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=804.38s)]
*  And then of course, there's funding that comes from strategics. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=810.14s)]
*  So M&A has been really strong last year, and we expect that trend to continue. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=813.5s)]
*  And in addition to kind of the strategic capital, which is great because it's permanent, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=820.7s)]
*  and then the specialist capital that's coming from us, we have been doing more of royalty [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=825.66s)]
*  investing and non-equity, like non-routive financing for companies. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=831.74s)]
*  So there's not just one funding solution that can meet the entire needs of the company. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=837.34s)]
*  So we're thinking about ways that we can offer bespoke financing packages to companies. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=843.34s)]
*  You mentioned some of the strategies. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=849.02s)]
*  Are there any maybe undervalued or under-recognized sectors within that or therapy types that you [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=851.82s)]
*  particularly like to focus on? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=858.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=861.34s)]
*  I mean, actually, even today, even with the bounce back, so our sector had sort of a low. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=861.58s)]
*  The XBI traded down to the low 60s at the end of October was our most recent trough. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=868.3000000000001s)]
*  And then it had a really strong comeback and reached 105. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=875.1800000000001s)]
*  It has retraced back down to 90. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=881.26s)]
*  Sector is meaningfully up from its lows, but there are still a ton of great values out there. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=884.3000000000001s)]
*  So there are still a lot of opportunities that we're finding really great deals. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=892.38s)]
*  So I mean, some areas that we're particularly excited about, like outside of traditional [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=898.62s)]
*  sort of oncology, like small molecules and immuno-oncology, we're excited about by specifics. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=903.6600000000001s)]
*  We're excited about radiopharma. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=908.94s)]
*  So we're finding good deals in a number of these areas. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=910.22s)]
*  ADCs and cell therapies. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=913.1s)]
*  I think the autoimmune space had a really big win with the Prometheus acquisition last year, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=915.26s)]
*  but there's still a lot of opportunity even in that obesity and metabolic trait because [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=923.98s)]
*  obviously, Lilly and Novo are the leaders. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=928.62s)]
*  But we're very excited about a number of unknown and underappreciated next generation [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=932.3000000000001s)]
*  therapies and developments. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=940.3000000000001s)]
*  So if you look, you'll find. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=941.66s)]
*  And in rare disease, there's definitely a lot of cheap calls out there. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=944.14s)]
*  You could also argue that the capital markets outside of the US are behind and they're weaker. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=951.5s)]
*  So in Europe and in China, there are also some great deals. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=959.1s)]
*  You mentioned a couple of the big companies there. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=965.18s)]
*  I was recently interviewing someone who said that those big companies used to have very big [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=967.9s)]
*  R&D departments and develop a lot of drugs themselves, but now they prefer to acquire [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=974.38s)]
*  companies, smaller companies that are kind of doing it for them, I guess. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=979.9s)]
*  Is that kind of the way forward, do you think? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=984.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, absolutely. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=988.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's sort of the beauty of this symbiotic relationship between biotech and big pharma. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=990.38s)]
*  Biotech can be nimble and can make really meaningful advancements. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=997.34s)]
*  And at some point, the large companies, whether it's big pharma or large biotech, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1003.58s)]
*  they have the ability to sell a drug and to properly commercialize it and to take those [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1009.02s)]
*  approved therapies and bring them to global markets, which a biotech company, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1015.58s)]
*  particularly a small or even a mid-sized biotech company, doesn't always have the capability of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1021.66s)]
*  doing it on its own. So I think we're seeing a lot of that. I think that is part of driving this wave, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1027.1s)]
*  particularly if you think about M&A, big pharma revenues are at an all-time high [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1034.06s)]
*  as innovation continues and approved drugs are high quality. And we're seeing a lot of these [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1040.62s)]
*  commercial launches. So with that capital, it makes sense. And some of the drivers are [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1046.62s)]
*  their need for top-line growth, upcoming patent cliffs. And so companies that have approved drugs [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1053.6599999999999s)]
*  or maybe soon to be approved drugs, but also one step earlier, companies that are new IPOs [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1061.4199999999998s)]
*  are going to be sort of the next set of targets. You mentioned M&A's earlier. Is there a trend with [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1069.82s)]
*  M&A's or is it still on the up? It has to be because of some of these drivers. It has to be [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1076.86s)]
*  because of the upcoming patent cliffs and that need for top-line growth. So we would expect to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1083.98s)]
*  see that. And we've had a dozen deals this year already with an average premium of over 100%. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1089.98s)]
*  And the deals that we have seen this year have been across five different therapeutic areas, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1097.42s)]
*  small molecule oncology, radiopharma, ABCs in oncology, and then in the metabolic space, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1103.42s)]
*  and then autoimmune and liver. So it's across subsectors and we think the trend is going to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1110.78s)]
*  continue. And what about the IPO market? You mentioned that a little bit earlier. 2023 seemed [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1116.94s)]
*  like it was a little bit quieter. What's the state of the market there? Yeah, that's right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1123.34s)]
*  So we've had eight IPOs in total already this year versus 11 last year. So we're outpacing [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  last year by a mile. I will note that of the IPOs this year, less than half of them are actually [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1135.8999999999999s)]
*  trading above their IPO price. So we think that folks are probably going to be a little bit more [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1143.1799999999998s)]
*  selective about taking something public until they know they've got a real chance of continuing [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1151.74s)]
*  to hit some of those milestones. So that's going to be, I think, a determining factor. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1158.7s)]
*  IPOs started strong out of the gate this year, but again, we haven't seen that much of the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1164.7s)]
*  generalist capital come back in. And if they don't see any sustainable valuation or market cap in [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1172.94s)]
*  these new public companies, they're not going to come back in. So we think things are going to be [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1180.14s)]
*  a lot more sort of intentional. I know that we talked a little bit about how companies may be [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1184.3000000000002s)]
*  struggling to bring money in. And the other thing that's kind of scary is that we're already almost [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1190.14s)]
*  at the end of April, which is very scary. But what are you seeing as maybe some of the major [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1195.5s)]
*  trends and developments so far in the biotech arena in 2024? Yeah, I mean, we're seeing a lot [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1201.18s)]
*  of really strong clinical data. So companies are doing well. And that, you know, hopefully, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1209.5s)]
*  that translates into more confidence from other funders and other sources of capital. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1216.22s)]
*  You know, FDA has also become a bit friendlier. I think we definitely went through a period where [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1222.14s)]
*  in that COVID and immediately post-COVID, where the folks at FDA were really kind of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1229.74s)]
*  bandwidth constrained because so many resources had gone to COVID. There was significant burnout. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1237.18s)]
*  A lot of people, you know, left a lot of drug reviewers, you know, left less experienced drug [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1242.78s)]
*  reviewers, stepped into their former manager shoes. And there was a very sort of conservative bent [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1247.58s)]
*  for that period following FDA. And now, particularly with someone like Peter Marks, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1254.06s)]
*  who's a real champion of gene therapies and genetic medicines, you know, we're seeing some [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1258.3s)]
*  approvals and FDA is friendlier. So, you know, hopefully with a wave of positive clinical data [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1263.74s)]
*  from biotech companies, and then also, you know, a stable or, you know, hopefully a lower interest [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1270.54s)]
*  rate environment, all that capital is going to come crashing back. And then you have elections [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1276.94s)]
*  in the US this year. So that might change everything again. Yeah, that's right. That's right. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1282.94s)]
*  So, I mean, look, there's still macro uncertainty, which is a potential headwind. The election, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1289.1s)]
*  of course, is, you know, a headwind, even for sentiment, because I think there's capital that [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1295.5s)]
*  is going to want to stay sidelined until there's certainty around who is in the office. But at [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1301.4199999999998s)]
*  least we kind of know what we're dealing with right now with the IRA. We know sort of what drugs are [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1307.58s)]
*  going to go through negotiations. You know, hopefully, hopefully things will change for the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1314.78s)]
*  better in the next election. You know, as we try to be creative in our thinking around supporting [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1319.18s)]
*  companies, it gives us just ammunition to propose different funding strategies to companies. And so [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1324.06s)]
*  that's why we've been doing, for example, royalties or synthetic royalties, particularly for companies [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1330.62s)]
*  that are launching new drugs. Could you explain a bit about the royalties market? You know, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1335.66s)]
*  historically, you know, you have either an academic asset that has been developed. And [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1340.06s)]
*  if you look at this royalty landscape, there are companies that have drugs that, you know, someone [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1346.7s)]
*  owns a piece of that revenue stream. And that last sort of five years, you know, you've seen [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1353.8999999999999s)]
*  royalty pharma is kind of the dominant player in that space. So there will be a competitive bid [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1359.6599999999999s)]
*  around a commercial product. And then financiers will compete on, you know, paying for a slice of [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1366.14s)]
*  that royalty stream. Generally, they're looking for an existing commercial product that the revenues [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1373.42s)]
*  are known. And you don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out, you know, or predicting what [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1380.22s)]
*  that commercial is going to look like. You know what the peak sales are. And then there's a [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1385.18s)]
*  competition around cost of capital. And, you know, whoever can deliver the lowest cost of capital, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1390.3000000000002s)]
*  will win that mandate. We're looking at situations where we can, for example, go earlier in that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1396.38s)]
*  process. So let's say a company, you know, has their first drug just gets approved, someone has [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1403.0200000000002s)]
*  to predict how much revenue that drug is going to achieve, like what their peak sales are going to [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1410.38s)]
*  be. And there will obviously be a Wall Street consensus around this. But, you know, we have a [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1415.98s)]
*  team, and we've been doing this since day one, I mean, for the last 15 years, working on commercial [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1422.06s)]
*  forecasting. So we look at every drug that launches every year and try to assess what we think that [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1427.74s)]
*  commercial forecast is going to look like. So we analyze that in-house. And now we realize that [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1435.1799999999998s)]
*  actually, not a lot of people are doing this. And so we can approach a company and then basically [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1440.3s)]
*  offer them a deal to give them money in exchange for a percentage of those revenues. And so these [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1449.02s)]
*  are true sales. So, you know, we're buying, call it 5% of the revenue stream of a particular drug [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1455.5s)]
*  for its patent life. And this is non-dilutive. So in some way, it has that difference from raising [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1464.86s)]
*  equity. It's a lower cost of capital than equity, but then it's not as burdensome to a company's [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1472.78s)]
*  balance sheet like debt would be. You mentioned how you have offices in New York and London and [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1478.54s)]
*  in China. Are there differences regionally between companies in the biotech market? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1486.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there are. I mean, the biggest sort of difference actually comes down to capital. So [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1492.54s)]
*  Europe and UK, the ecosystem is quite fragmented. I mean, you have a lot of European VCs, but you [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1498.3s)]
*  don't have that public capital market ecosystem like you do here in the US. So companies [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1505.66s)]
*  tend to make their way to the US and end up listing on the NASDAQ or oftentimes are sold. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1512.3000000000002s)]
*  And you'll see strategic sales tend to happen a lot earlier when they're coming from the UK and [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1521.5s)]
*  Europe than here in the US. China has had a real struggle. The last couple of years have been [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1527.02s)]
*  tough, but they've had an even tougher time with their capital markets the last few years. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1533.74s)]
*  So there are opportunities. Six, seven years ago, we saw a lot of Chinese VCs coming to the US and [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1538.78s)]
*  acquiring assets and paying up for those assets and starting a number of Chinese oncology companies. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1546.3s)]
*  It was all about importing innovation to try and catch up with the West. They've done that to an [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1553.82s)]
*  extent, but I think the capital markets have dried up materially. So now it's sort of flipped. If they [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1560.22s)]
*  do the work, you're going to have to think about how to export some of that innovation. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1568.7s)]
*  And is there anything that you wanted to talk about that we haven't? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1571.98s)]
*  I think I would just want to express that this is one of those incredible moments [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1576.78s)]
*  where I think it hasn't caught on to the broader sort of pool of investors that there's incredible [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1584.54s)]
*  innovation that's happening in the biotech space and it's still relatively underappreciated. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1592.22s)]
*  And with a better macro situation and when more capital starts pouring in, you won't be able to [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1599.1s)]
*  find the deals that you're finding today. And one other area I would also just point out that we [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1604.22s)]
*  didn't talk about, but I think is important, is when the GLP-1s hit the market, everyone said, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1611.58s)]
*  well, this is going to kill med tech. Devices are not going to be needed because now people are [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1617.26s)]
*  going to be living longer. And actually, our thesis is that the opposite is true. And we just saw [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1622.06s)]
*  an acquisition by Johnson & Johnson last week of a company called Shockwave, $13 million, all cash [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1629.82s)]
*  acquisition. Johnson & Johnson has a large market share for treating cardiovascular disease with [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1635.98s)]
*  medical devices. They had a couple of other previous acquisitions in the space. Now with [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1642.22s)]
*  Shockwave, they can address coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease. But this [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1647.42s)]
*  is important because we think that actually the GLP-1s are going to lead to higher utilization rates [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1653.02s)]
*  of devices. We're seeing that old age is a corollary to the usage for med devices, whether it's [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1657.82s)]
*  for cardiovascular or joint hip or knee replacements. So we think that's a bullish [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1663.34s)]
*  thesis for devices as well. So a really good and thorough overview of the current situation [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1670.22s)]
*  surrounding financing in the biotech industry there. Don't forget to check out the latest news [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1681.82s)]
*  and articles at lebiotech.eu. And I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1687.42s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_Z-QgEVu8&t=1694.38s)]
