Video Description: As September 8 is Stand Up To Cancer Day, one area of promising research lies in cytokine-based drugs, which have the potential to activate T cells against tumors. Historically, toxicity from systemic cytokine treatment has remained a challenge, prompting several companies to explore ways to “engineer” drugs with modified cytokine molecules like interleukin 2 (IL-2) for targeted and safer delivery.  


Cue Biopharma is a standout in this field, harnessing nature’s ‘cues’ to selectively activate the immune system against cancer. Their approach overcomes IL-2’s narrow therapeutic window by directing IL-2 delivery specifically to cancer cells, targeting only disease-specific T cells.  


Cue Biopharma is a Boston, U.S., based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate disease-specific T cells directly within the patient’s body. The company’s proprietary platform, Immuno-STAT (Selective Targeting and Alteration of T cells) and biologics are designed to harness the body’s intrinsic immune system as T cell engagers without the need for ex vivo manipulation or broad systemic immune modulation.


Anish Suri, Cue’s chief scientific officer, spoke with us about Cue Biopharma’s platform and its approach in the evolution of immunotherapies.

# Beyond Biotech podcast 62 – cytokine-based drugs
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech Podcast number 62. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornell and this is the weekly LeBioTech podcast and this episode is going out on September [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  8th. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=18.56s)]
*  And September 8th is World Literacy Day, it's World Physical Therapy Day, it's also Pediatric [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=19.96s)]
*  Hematology and Oncology Nurses Day, and it is Stand Up to Cancer Day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=26.96s)]
*  In terms of science milestones, it's the day in 1930 that Scotch Tape was launched, and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=34.08s)]
*  while Scotch Tape isn't Scottish, a Scottish inventor by the name of Dunlop invented the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  pneumatic tire on this day in 1892. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  It's also the day in 1854 that Dr John Snow removed a pump handle in London to stop a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=50.52s)]
*  cholera outbreak, as he suspected that the outbreak was due to contaminated water from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=57.36s)]
*  the pump, and he was right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=62.74s)]
*  I did a couple of interviews with people at an event in Portugal this week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=65.64s)]
*  I wasn't there, just using wonderful technology to do the interviews, but it was interesting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  that the temperature here in Scotland was higher than it was just outside Lisbon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=74.64s)]
*  However, it looks like it's not going to last, as there's a prolonged spell of rain on its [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=79.8s)]
*  way, just to coincide with the big air show that takes place this weekend here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=85.2s)]
*  I guess that's just known as business as usual. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=90.0s)]
*  Anyway, that brings us to today's theme and guest, and as we're now in September there [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  are lots of events around cancer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=98.22s)]
*  Last week we looked at Blood Cancer Awareness Month, and as I mentioned earlier, today is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=100.7s)]
*  Stand Up to Cancer Day, and there are an awful lot of companies doing exactly that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=106.34s)]
*  through their research. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=111.94s)]
*  And so today our guest is Anish Suri from Q Bio Pharma. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=113.76s)]
*  He is the Chief Scientific Officer at Q, and he spoke with us about Q Bio Pharma's platform, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=119.58s)]
*  cytokine-based drugs, and Q's approach in the evolution of immunotherapies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  So I guess the easy question first is if you could tell me a little bit about the background [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=134.54s)]
*  of Q. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=139.44s)]
*  So again, thank you for the opportunity. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=140.44s)]
*  Q was founded on the premise of harnessing the very natural signals that the immune system [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=142.56s)]
*  uses to modulate itself. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=147.88s)]
*  So this is a big difference from what others do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=149.92s)]
*  We believe there's a significant advantage here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=153.34s)]
*  Nature's already done the core protein engineering design selection through millions of years [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=155.44s)]
*  of vertebrate evolution. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=160.28s)]
*  And what we've sort of founded a platform is a way we can pluck these very nature's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=162.92s)]
*  signals or Q's, hence the name of the company, and make very selective targeted drugs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=168.66s)]
*  So that automatically dials in two very important components as you think about therapeutic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=175.48s)]
*  It dials in specificity and selectivity based on what's been engineered for the host, and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=179.89999999999998s)]
*  it dials in safety as a matter of that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=187.1s)]
*  When you look for really bioactive molecules like cytokines or immune activation signals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=189.3s)]
*  So this has been the core sort of basis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=195.58s)]
*  And that principle applies across all the way from immunotherapy of cancers, where we've [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  made most progress now in the clinic, two different molecules in about five different [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=202.66000000000003s)]
*  solid cancers, trials ongoing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  Very exciting data emerging already from the first one. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=210.0s)]
*  The same principle would apply for immunotherapy of chronic infectious diseases, and in reverse [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=212.8s)]
*  actually would apply for all immunity where you really don't want to carpet just immunosuppress [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=218.0s)]
*  the patient as we do today, but selectively attenuate and tune out the pathogenic T cells [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=222.55999999999997s)]
*  or the immune repertoire while keeping your broad immunity intact. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=228.72s)]
*  So this has very far reaching consequences as you think about the next evolution and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=233.89999999999998s)]
*  generation of immunotherapeutics. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=238.72s)]
*  And could you tell me a little bit about the current cytokine based drug treatments and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  how we've got to this point? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=245.48s)]
*  Yeah, look, so cytokines are a great example of molecules and signals that are extremely [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  potent and exchanged by immune cells to modulate a host of functions, all the way from activation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  to generation of effective responses to down modulation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=259.44s)]
*  So in the case of cancer immunotherapy, IL-2, for example, has been a very well validated [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=263.76s)]
*  cytokine as a target. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=268.32s)]
*  It's a validated drug. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=271.0s)]
*  It's an approved drug. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=272.0s)]
*  The problem has been, is it activates every T cell and systemically activates the immune [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=273.0s)]
*  system. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=277.72s)]
*  So the challenge that becomes is one that deals with the constant, which is how do you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=278.72s)]
*  direct IL-2 for selective consumption by those T cells that are specific for cancer antigens [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=282.92s)]
*  while sparing everything else? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=290.0s)]
*  That's how you generate a therapeutic index. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=291.68s)]
*  And that becomes the analogy that I've often used for this on the outside has been you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=293.36s)]
*  don't need to light your house on fire to light up your kitchen stove. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=297.8s)]
*  And that's what our platform allows us to do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=301.96s)]
*  Because when you look at what defines a tumor specific T cell is the fact that that T cell [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=304.08s)]
*  has a T cell receptor or TCR specific to tumor antigens. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  What defines a virus specific T cell is that T cell has a TCR that recognizes virus antigens [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=312.88s)]
*  or a bacterial T cell or bacterial antigens. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=318.4s)]
*  So we've devised through this immunostat platform that we've deciphered to selectively target [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=320.52s)]
*  those T cells that harbor TCRs for tumor antigens and deliver IL-2 to them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=326.08s)]
*  The frequency of that is extremely low in the patient. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  So 99.99% of T cells in a patient or an individual have no relevance to cancer antigens. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=335.52s)]
*  And that's an immunological fact. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  These precursor frequencies oftentimes are about one in 10,000 or rarer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=344.28s)]
*  So the question is how do you spare the 9,999 when focusing on this one? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=349.9s)]
*  Well we've gone after the marker of the highest fidelity that nature gave you, which is the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=355.8s)]
*  T cell receptor. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's been really extraordinary in the case of IL-2 what we've done. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=361.64s)]
*  And that's very different from what others have done. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=364.48s)]
*  Others have done taking the cytokine and have attenuated the cytokine to its interactions [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=366.72s)]
*  with the cytokine receptor. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=371.68s)]
*  So you make it less potent or less biased to one receptor subunit over the other. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  However, what that does is it still generates the cytokine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=378.16s)]
*  That's an equal opportunity agonist of every T cell. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=381.32s)]
*  There is no selectivity for the consumer. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=383.94s)]
*  So there have been challenges. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=387.14s)]
*  We've seen this with the not alpha cytokines and the failures that they've been quite visible [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=388.94s)]
*  with significant investment. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=393.06s)]
*  But the data now after ASCO that we've put out with our first molecule, which we believe [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=394.54s)]
*  de-risk the entire platform, not only do we have single agent activity in late stage cancer [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=399.38s)]
*  patients that have failed many prior lines of therapy, but in the frontline setting where [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=404.96s)]
*  checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1 are approved, we were actually more than double the response [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=410.14s)]
*  rate. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=415.3s)]
*  And that is remarkable when you think about in the early stage of clinical development, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=416.62s)]
*  at least from our vantage point. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit more about the platform in terms of how you've done it differently [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=423.02s)]
*  and how you approached the issue? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  Because obviously everybody's doing it slightly differently to you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=430.97999999999996s)]
*  How did you get the idea to approach it differently? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=434.12s)]
*  Yeah, so the technology then the company was really founded from foundational work that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=438.18s)]
*  came out of Dr. Steve Almos Lab, who's the chair of Structural Biology and Biochemistry [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=442.18s)]
*  at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=446.98s)]
*  So Steve is a structural biologist and he looked at the immune interface, which is how [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=449.62s)]
*  the T cell gets activated by an antigen presenting cell, like a dendritic cell and that encounter. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=453.54s)]
*  He looked at that interface from the lens of a protein engineer, which was very good [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=459.9s)]
*  for the company and not from the lens of a contaminated immunologist like myself. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=463.24s)]
*  And he very quickly determined that the protein modules that the T cell was seeking could [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=467.54s)]
*  be formatted on an antibody FCPAC-borne. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=472.5s)]
*  So what the T cell recognizes is a peptide HLA complex. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=475.58000000000004s)]
*  HLAs are specialized molecules that present peptide antigens to T cells. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=479.18s)]
*  That's where the T cell encounters them on an antigen presenting cells. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=484.66s)]
*  Steve essentially took the entire sort of interface and translated it into a very stable [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=487.66s)]
*  protein therapeutic. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  So what we've got here are peptide HLAs to which you can then attach any given immune [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=493.54s)]
*  modulation signal like a cytokine, like a cell surface receptor that have been characterized. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=498.98s)]
*  The principle is that that peptide HLA will only engage those T cell receptors that are [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=503.98s)]
*  specific for that peptide antigen. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=509.1s)]
*  And that peptide antigen is derived from the target of choice, a tumor peptide in the case [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=511.54s)]
*  of a tumor cell targeting a virus peptide in the case of a virally infected cell, you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=515.86s)]
*  know, there's following those sorts of principles. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=521.02s)]
*  So that was a big breakthrough for us because that allows us to dial in exquisite selectivity [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=522.82s)]
*  and specificity. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=528.94s)]
*  So you now have a targeted missile like approach where you can get the IL-2 to only those T [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=529.94s)]
*  cells that recognize that specific peptide HLA that's a part of the immune standard. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  And by virtue of that, you can make that IL-2 being focused on a very small fraction of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=542.22s)]
*  your repertoire that is actually irrelevant to disease. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=547.2600000000001s)]
*  If this molecule bumps into the vast irrelevant part of the repertoire, the IL-2 has been [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=551.18s)]
*  affinity tuned that its engagement on its own is a relatively inert outcome. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=555.78s)]
*  And that's what allows us to build in the therapeutic index. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=562.4599999999999s)]
*  So Jim, if you look at it, what we've done in the clinic and demonstrated where IL-2 [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=566.38s)]
*  in all other previous human experience has been dosed in the microgram per kilogram range, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  just to give you a sense on how bioactive the cytokine is. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=577.68s)]
*  We've actually gone all the way up to milligrams per kilogram. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=580.82s)]
*  We've gone up to eight mics per kig with no MTD established. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=583.3000000000001s)]
*  That's a pretty remarkable outcome when you see the amount of IL-2 we've been able to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=588.62s)]
*  dose safely. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=591.7800000000001s)]
*  And in fact, I recommended phase two doses for mics per kig at this point in time where [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=593.2600000000001s)]
*  we've expanded out to many patients. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=597.5s)]
*  So we think this is just a significant breakthrough. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=600.58s)]
*  And that principle, by the way, applies for any given immune activation. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=604.7s)]
*  It doesn't have to be just IL-2. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=607.7800000000001s)]
*  It could be IL-12. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=610.02s)]
*  It could be IL-15. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=611.02s)]
*  It could be IL-21. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=612.02s)]
*  A host of other cytokines that activate the immune system. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=613.02s)]
*  But we're avoiding, through this platform, the carpet bombing of the entire immune system [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=618.14s)]
*  while focusing on the component that matters. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's the biggest differentiation over what others are doing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=624.78s)]
*  Does that mean that there are less potential side effects? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=629.5s)]
*  There are less potential side effects. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  That also means that the tolerability profile is more favorable. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=635.02s)]
*  That's what we've now seen. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=638.66s)]
*  We've dosed over 80 patients in our trials. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=640.18s)]
*  We've not seen any of the major IL-2 toxicities, vascular leak syndrome, and the cytokine release [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=643.66s)]
*  syndrome. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=650.02s)]
*  These are really nasty side effects, oftentimes leading to fatalities, grade four, grade five [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=651.02s)]
*  outcomes. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=655.5799999999999s)]
*  Our profile, as we've reported in the various oncology meetings, including the last ASCO [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=657.38s)]
*  meeting in Chicago in June, has been really encouraging. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=662.62s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=666.78s)]
*  Another is when we've combined this with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, and this is the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=667.78s)]
*  first instance is Merck's memory user map, we've not seen any signal of synergistic talks, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=671.66s)]
*  which oftentimes has happened when you combine two immune activating modalities together [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=678.02s)]
*  that you see an uptick in the safety concerns. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=682.54s)]
*  So that, again, bodes very well. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=684.9399999999999s)]
*  To me, it's not from a personal vantage point. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  It's not very surprising because that is the expected outcome is if you tailor mark and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=689.42s)]
*  tailor activate the immune system and avoid the systemic activation, you should be able [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  to get immunity while preventing pathologic immunity to self. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=697.74s)]
*  Those are really positive things for patients. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=702.46s)]
*  Are there any other positives for the patients that you're working with? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=705.22s)]
*  We just reported, Jim, in a late stage metastatic patient, which we're really thrilled about, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=710.58s)]
*  and we've just confirmed it, a complete response, which is very rare to see. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=714.7s)]
*  So metastatic disease, remember, these are patients with widespread tumor deposits all [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=719.1800000000001s)]
*  over the body. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=724.66s)]
*  In this case, the patient had mets in the liver, mets in the bone, which are very hard. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=725.66s)]
*  It's still on the trial, but a year into the trial, these lesions kept on becoming smaller [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=731.38s)]
*  and smaller, to the point when at about 40 plus weeks, the patient presents with a complete [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=736.3s)]
*  response. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=742.42s)]
*  Well, we just think this is remarkable just to see that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=743.42s)]
*  We've had several patients now that are continuing with durable responses going on to a year [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=746.8199999999999s)]
*  and beyond. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=751.26s)]
*  That's quite remarkable. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=752.6999999999999s)]
*  These are not just responses where the tumor comes down for a period of time and then bounces [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=753.82s)]
*  back up. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=757.6400000000001s)]
*  We're seeing durability. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=758.6400000000001s)]
*  You know what they talk about the tail end of immunotherapy going on? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=759.6400000000001s)]
*  We're seeing that now just for a large number of patients. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=762.94s)]
*  The other observation, which has been quite remarkable, and we reported on this a few [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=766.6400000000001s)]
*  weeks back, is the fact that patients that express low levels of PD ligand in the tumor [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=770.34s)]
*  environment, so this is the CPS score, low levels of PD ligand patients are refractory [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=777.24s)]
*  or not as responsive to anti-PD-1 therapies as the ones that have higher levels of PD [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=783.06s)]
*  ligand. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=788.2199999999999s)]
*  But in that subset, for example, in the head and neck situation, head and neck cancer, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=789.2199999999999s)]
*  where we have the first molecule being evaluated, the patients with low CPS scores, the response [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=793.8599999999999s)]
*  rate with PEMBALusumab alone, historical, is 14%. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  About one in six to one in seven patients will respond with the vast majority not responding. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=808.1s)]
*  In that unique subset, if you stratify further, stratify the combination with the immunostat, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=813.86s)]
*  which is Q101, our response rate when you put it on top of the checkpoint is 50%. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=820.26s)]
*  So there's a big difference between 14.5% to 50% where you now have a one in two. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=825.9s)]
*  I mean, it's remarkable, a 3X increase. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=831.74s)]
*  So that's a very unique observation we feel as the data continues. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=834.74s)]
*  And again, we feel this is going to have a read through because if you think about the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=838.1s)]
*  checkpoint space, the checkpoints are contingent upon you having the right T cell as a patient. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=840.52s)]
*  If you don't have the right T cells in the first place, what good is a checkpoint? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=846.0600000000001s)]
*  Well we are the precursor to that because we put those guys in play. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=849.94s)]
*  So we think this has broad ramifications for expanding not only the patient reach, but [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=853.4s)]
*  the depth of clinical responses on both axes. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=860.74s)]
*  And I think that from a patient lens, we think it's going to be transformation. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=863.9s)]
*  I still think that's really good news. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=866.86s)]
*  As far as the delivery goes, is it something that you have to, you're mentioning that people [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=869.14s)]
*  are seeing the tumors pretty much disappear. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=875.62s)]
*  Do you still need to treat them or once that's happened, are they free from you having to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=878.8199999999999s)]
*  treat them? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=884.9s)]
*  Well, it's a fantastic point because under the current trial protocol, you continue to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=885.9s)]
*  treat, but one could imagine a situation down the road where this becomes a very testable [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=891.02s)]
*  point that once you have no evidence of disease, you should be able to stop and the patient [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=896.74s)]
*  should be able to maintain. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=902.22s)]
*  Because if you think about our drug, Jim, our drug doesn't do anything directly to the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=903.34s)]
*  cancer. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  What our drug does is activates your immune system intrinsically to create a very effective [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=908.6999999999999s)]
*  anti-tumor T cell repertoire, just like you would for an infectious agent as you do with [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  vaccines. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=919.06s)]
*  You have anti-tumor T cells and you create that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=920.0999999999999s)]
*  And then when you have a reinfection, you encounter it with your own repertoire. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  You don't necessarily need another. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=924.9799999999999s)]
*  We think same principles could apply here. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=927.26s)]
*  We've obviously get down the road. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=929.0999999999999s)]
*  This is some of the areas where we will test this out. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=930.5s)]
*  But I think that is a really exciting sort of proposition to see if this is providing [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=933.5799999999999s)]
*  down the road what we refer to in the field as sterilizing immunity. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=938.2199999999999s)]
*  So you've put the right repertoire in place and that can then control the reaction. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=942.2199999999999s)]
*  And there are variants that emerge that the immune system is competent enough. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=946.22s)]
*  And as we're moving upstream and upstream in the lines, because as trials start, Jim, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=951.18s)]
*  as you well know, with novel first-class medicines, you usually go to late stage cancer patients [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=955.58s)]
*  that have been really beat up through multiple lines of therapies and failure. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=960.42s)]
*  So immune competence of the individual, their immune competence metrics are not at the best. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=964.5s)]
*  But as you move earlier and earlier in earlier lines of treatment, where the cancer is not [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=970.3s)]
*  yet fully sort of metastasized or you can stop it early, we think this sort of a mechanism [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=975.78s)]
*  may further provide enormous benefit just by the sheer health metrics of the patient [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=980.62s)]
*  being more healthier from the immune lens. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=986.14s)]
*  Yes, I was just going to ask about how different stages of the disease, because obviously the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=988.8199999999999s)]
*  further along with the disease you are, the less capable the immune system is. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=994.54s)]
*  And also the older you get, the less capable the immune system is. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=999.3s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1003.9s)]
*  And so one of the reasons why we went in late stage as a monotherapy was to make the point [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1005.6s)]
*  that as a single agent, this unique platform is active and can provide anti-tumor efficacy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1013.44s)]
*  And that's what we've demonstrated in monotherapy activity. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1019.88s)]
*  And that becomes very important as you then look at earlier lines of therapy data, including [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1023.24s)]
*  combinations where people then don't have to have any doubt whether you have an active [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1028.24s)]
*  platform or not, because you've actually demonstrated it being active in patients that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1032.64s)]
*  have failed prior lines of therapy. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1036.44s)]
*  And now you're simply moving it upstream with no additive toxicity. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1038.3600000000001s)]
*  So from the safety, again, a very favorable way to go. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1042.2s)]
*  And as you move in earlier lines, a couple of things happen. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1045.72s)]
*  One is you're right. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1048.16s)]
*  So the patient metrics are generally much better health metrics. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1049.16s)]
*  The other aspect is if you can really target it at the level where the cancer is still [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  metastasized, that also creates a very unique opportunity and bring about what we believe [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1058.88s)]
*  is going to be significantly more therapeutic benefits. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1064.2800000000002s)]
*  So to that end, we have a trial ongoing, driven actually, it's an investigator initiated trial [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1067.4s)]
*  being done at Washington University in the head and neck cancer patients, where they've [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1073.44s)]
*  got a localized tumor mass that is going to be surgically resected. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1077.96s)]
*  And then the patient's going to go on some standard care treatment. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1080.92s)]
*  But during that short period before it is a surgical resection, you get the Q molecule. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1083.16s)]
*  Q101. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1087.8s)]
*  So then you have a very rich translational data set to really examine the tumor mass [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1088.8s)]
*  pre and post administration to really drive home the point of the changes in the immune [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1093.76s)]
*  microenvironment in the cancer that happened. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1098.68s)]
*  And we believe that that's going to obviously lend important mechanistic insights. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1101.54s)]
*  And that trial is going really well. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1105.08s)]
*  We're very excited when that data is going to be discussed publicly in the future. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1107.12s)]
*  So I guess early diagnosis is a help in all of these cases? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1111.44s)]
*  Early diagnosis, it is. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1117.14s)]
*  And if you think about it, the earlier you go, the more sort of selective and safe you [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1118.38s)]
*  almost have to be. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1122.46s)]
*  You can't take a sledgehammer approach from the earliest point simply because that creates [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1124.5800000000002s)]
*  a lot of liabilities. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1130.26s)]
*  It does not create for an effective stance in terms of combinations and potential things [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1131.26s)]
*  you can bring together. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1136.0600000000002s)]
*  So we feel there are several advantages here from the mechanism viewpoint. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1137.14s)]
*  There's also several advantages, Jim, from the platform itself. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1140.7800000000002s)]
*  These molecules are manufactured. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1143.92s)]
*  For example, if you just look at the manufacturability, they're made exactly like an antibody molecule. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1146.1s)]
*  So we are a very small company of about 50 people. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1150.4599999999998s)]
*  But the manufacturability, we just did this with an external CDMO using 30 years of commercial [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1153.9399999999998s)]
*  monoclonal experience that we've had upstream downstream. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1159.5s)]
*  So that's actually a very unique win. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1162.5s)]
*  So it's a novel platform with a very boring manufacturability that's well established. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1164.02s)]
*  And so the cost of goods, it's given every three weeks IV like an antibody drug. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1168.98s)]
*  It has an antibody FC on it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1173.36s)]
*  So that is again a very unique proposition. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1175.4s)]
*  We've seen this now the shelf stability to give you a sense on protein engineering and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1178.5600000000002s)]
*  the strength of that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  The shelf stability of the GMP, the drug batch that's in the clinic is going north of 36 [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1183.48s)]
*  months. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1189.52s)]
*  Most monoclonal antibodies, the stability is about a couple of years. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1190.72s)]
*  So we're equal to a better than most monoclonals. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1196.0800000000002s)]
*  Again speaking to the beautiful protein engineering and stability because you can have a great [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  platform. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1203.96s)]
*  It's a great target, but if it's not manufacturable and it's not practical, it's hard to make [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1205.44s)]
*  it accessible to patients. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1209.32s)]
*  And in this case, we've just been really thrilled with the metrics that we've seen both on the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1211.44s)]
*  manufacturability end, but also on the stability end. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1215.72s)]
*  You mentioned that it's not specifically treating cancer. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1219.44s)]
*  Is it applicable to all different kinds of cancer? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1223.3600000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1226.4s)]
*  So what I meant by that was the molecule is not directly inducing any anti-tumor death. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1227.4s)]
*  It's doing it by activating the immune system, which then recognizes the cancer as being [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1232.36s)]
*  foreign and destroys it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1237.32s)]
*  But one of the strengths of the platform is the modularity. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  Because for example, once you have this in place, then you can simply change the tumor [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1242.52s)]
*  antigen from one molecule to the next to change the tumor indication. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1247.1999999999998s)]
*  And that usually is a very small peptide. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1251.3999999999999s)]
*  The T-cell apatope gem is about a nine to 10 amino acid segment. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  So this first molecule that I'm describing to you in the clinic, Q101, has an apatope [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1258.08s)]
*  from the human papilloma virus for HPV-driven epithelial cancers, like head and neck cancer, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1264.04s)]
*  like cervical cancer, like anal-penile vulva cancers. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1270.48s)]
*  The second one in the clinic that we got the IND approval last year from the FDA targets [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1274.76s)]
*  Wim's Tumor 1, which is another oncofetal antigen expressed by many different solid [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1279.76s)]
*  cancers. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  So we have that in ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal, and gastric, but also massive opportunities [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1286.64s)]
*  in glioblastoma, lung, breast, AML, multiple myeloma, et cetera. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1291.16s)]
*  Now, the difference between the first molecule and the second is only a nine to 10 amino [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1296.44s)]
*  acid segment of the T-cell apatope primarily. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1300.76s)]
*  99% of the molecule is sequence identical. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1303.2s)]
*  So when you've derised the first one, that's what I was telling you, you've derised the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1306.64s)]
*  entire platform. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1309.5600000000002s)]
*  And the FDA actually acknowledged that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1311.2s)]
*  We were really thrilled because they endorsed that perspective because when we got the IND [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1312.96s)]
*  approval for our second molecule, we did not need to do any further IND enabling preclinical [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1318.16s)]
*  toxicology because the clinical data from the first one in the patients was sufficient [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1323.92s)]
*  to have a read through. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1328.68s)]
*  Plus the FDA allowed us to start that second trial at a MIG-per-KIG, which is a clinically [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1330.2s)]
*  active dose. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1335.56s)]
*  And the reason that becomes important is it saved us about a year's worth of dose escalation. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1336.56s)]
*  Where Q101 as a first in class molecule in man for the first time, that dose escalation [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1341.5400000000002s)]
*  started at 60 micrograms per KIG and we dose escalated to pick our dose. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1347.46s)]
*  102, which is the Worm's tumor one molecule, started at a MIG-per-KIG. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1352.5s)]
*  So it's an enormous saving in times of efficiency and it's an enormous saving in terms of regulatory [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1356.1000000000001s)]
*  guidance. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1361.9s)]
*  And we think that's going to have a read through because all we have to do now is to remember [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1362.9s)]
*  the core IL-2 framework remains the same. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1365.98s)]
*  All you're doing simply is swapping out different tumor antigens to change the antigen to will. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1368.42s)]
*  So it creates essentially a limitless opportunity to go after every cancer known to man and [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1372.54s)]
*  furthermore going after even neoantigens and personalized immunotherapy. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1380.18s)]
*  Would the platform be applicable to any other conditions? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1387.8200000000002s)]
*  So we have published papers primarily driven by work done out of Steve Valmo and other [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1388.8200000000002s)]
*  folks who study viral infections. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1395.1000000000001s)]
*  There was a paper in Journal of Clinical Investigation a few years back looking at activation of HIV [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1397.78s)]
*  specific T cells for chronic infectious diseases. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1403.22s)]
*  That paper got a lot of sort of press with the same platform, but now instead of having [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1406.3s)]
*  a tumor epitope, you have a virus epitope. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1409.6599999999999s)]
*  So when you think about things like HPV, HCV or HIV, where you have the chronicity for [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1411.86s)]
*  chronic viral infections, same principle except you're changing now going from cancer to an [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1417.02s)]
*  infectious epitope. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1423.1399999999999s)]
*  So that paper was published by Harris Goldstein, Steve Valmo sometime back as a principle and [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1424.18s)]
*  a proof of concept of application of the same technology in a different therapeutic area. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1429.9s)]
*  We've sort of reported on some early preclinical work and have presented at meetings where [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1434.46s)]
*  now we've applied the same principle instead of activating the T cells, we've actually [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1439.5s)]
*  deactivated them to autoantigen. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1444.46s)]
*  So in this case, it was insulin and type 1 diabetes. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1446.8200000000002s)]
*  So again, when you think about that, the principle is essentially the same except that instead [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1449.7s)]
*  of broadly immunosuppressing the patient to bring down autoimmunity, you selectively [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1453.9s)]
*  deactivate only those cells that are recognizing your own self antigens. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1459.3400000000001s)]
*  So in this instance, then the antigens becomes your own self peptide to which you've already [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1463.8600000000001s)]
*  broken tolerance. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1467.98s)]
*  And insulin is a very well known one in diabetes. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1469.3400000000001s)]
*  Gluten is a great one in celiac, gluten epitopes or you know, so there are diseases where some [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1472.7800000000002s)]
*  of the auto antigens have been well characterized and the same principle would apply there. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1479.6200000000001s)]
*  So this is the modularity of the platform, not only going within an indication to go [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1483.58s)]
*  after multiple diseases like in cancer, going from one cancer to the other, but actually [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1488.54s)]
*  going beyond therapeutic areas to go after distinct biology and outcomes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1492.58s)]
*  I assume as well that because you're not having to take something from the patient and manipulate [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1497.6999999999998s)]
*  it and put it back in or take things from healthy people to put into somebody else, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1505.06s)]
*  I would assume that that helps with cost. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1511.14s)]
*  Yeah, so cost of goods and also if you look at economics and patient reach. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1513.5400000000002s)]
*  So you know, cell therapies have been great, but significant challenges both cost patient [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1517.8600000000001s)]
*  reach. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1522.5400000000002s)]
*  If I look outside the sort of the G5 in the US, I mean even access to a large part of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1523.5400000000002s)]
*  the world where there's a large population and large medical need. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1527.74s)]
*  This is essentially a biologic that is performing in a way very analogous, but doing cell therapy [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1531.3000000000002s)]
*  with the biologic and even the patient, but you harness the patient's own immune repertoire [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1535.98s)]
*  to become activated. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1540.02s)]
*  But essentially it is a T cell therapeutic that directs those right T cells against cancer. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1541.58s)]
*  So you know, we think there's a compare and contrast here where it has significant sort [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1546.3799999999999s)]
*  of ramifications and positive attributes when you compare to ex vivo technologies where [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1551.98s)]
*  you have to harness this. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1557.42s)]
*  There are conditioning regimens for the patients. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1559.1399999999999s)]
*  There's the turnaround time. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1561.3s)]
*  There's manufacturability challenges and furthermore costs. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1562.5s)]
*  So an immunostat in our first trials is given every three weeks IV. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1565.7s)]
*  Usually cell therapy, if you compare and contrast is a one shot treatment. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1570.74s)]
*  It's not like, you know, you have repeat folks coming back and you know, the feasibility [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1576.26s)]
*  of that is still to be fully sort of determined on how far reach and the impact. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1579.7s)]
*  Where are you at currently in the journey? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1585.6200000000001s)]
*  We did the first molecule in Jim in head and neck cancer patients. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1587.8600000000001s)]
*  We've got a monotherapy trial where we've already not only seen the responses that I [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1591.58s)]
*  described to you in late stage patients that are feeling multiple lines of therapy, but [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1596.06s)]
*  we've seen a clear increase in survival, which is the gold standard metric for any cancer [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1600.74s)]
*  therapies ultimately demonstrating an overall survival benefits. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  So to give you a sense in a third line setting where these patients have failed between three [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1608.98s)]
*  to all the way up to four or five, six lines of therapy, we are seeing a median overall [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1614.5s)]
*  survival now recommended phase two dose group that is now going about 14 months or north of that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1619.54s)]
*  And the reason I give you that number is in a second line setting, which is an earlier line [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1626.34s)]
*  with checkpoint inhibitors like Pembrolizumab, Merck's or BMS's anti PD1 nevolumab. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1631.06s)]
*  The median OS is between seven to eight months. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1637.46s)]
*  In a second line, there's no third line that likely is going to be even lower, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1641.3799999999999s)]
*  you know, four to six months is what investigators tell us because the patients are [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1645.62s)]
*  progressed, but we're seeing 14 months now at this point. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1649.46s)]
*  So that is quite remarkable. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1652.98s)]
*  So we think we have a clear registration of path there for which we are planning to engage the FDA [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1654.26s)]
*  towards the end of the year. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1660.1s)]
*  And then in a frontline setting, so this is in a frontline recurrent metastatic setting [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1661.54s)]
*  in the same cancer where the checkpoints like Merck's Pembrolizumab is approved, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1665.62s)]
*  but with a response rate of 19%, we've actually more than doubled that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1670.02s)]
*  Right now we're at in the combination of combining our molecule with Merck's [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1674.5s)]
*  Pembrolizumab, our response rate currently is at 44%, which includes the one complete [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1678.58s)]
*  response that I described to you. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1684.02s)]
*  Early data, but very exciting. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1685.46s)]
*  Remember, so this is from the first 16, 18 patients worth of data. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1687.54s)]
*  So again, you know, as this sort of matures, we feel that we have two, even in the first molecule, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1691.1399999999999s)]
*  we have two distinct registration paths. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1697.3799999999999s)]
*  You have the monotherapy in date stage and you have the frontline combination with checkpoints. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1699.46s)]
*  Then we've got the 102 molecule with the Wilms tumor one, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1704.1s)]
*  that dose escalation is happening right now in a basket of cancers, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1707.46s)]
*  ovarian colorectal, pancreatic and gastric. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1711.54s)]
*  We should complete that by the end of the year and then be able to choose a dose at [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1714.98s)]
*  what would be a recommended phase to dose and expand that out. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1718.1000000000001s)]
*  And that's a remarkable opportunity because those cancers are largely refractory to [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1721.7s)]
*  checkpoint blockade. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1726.9s)]
*  So we've already started to see as a monotherapy dose escalation metrics of antitumor efficacy. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1728.5s)]
*  We've seen reduction of metastatic lesions in patients. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1734.6599999999999s)]
*  We've seen stable disease. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1737.3s)]
*  We've seen decrease in tumor biomarkers in the blood as a monotherapy. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1738.58s)]
*  So if you can create momentum as a moment of therapy and demonstrate that, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1742.8999999999999s)]
*  then obviously a combination of that with a host of other agents, including immunotherapies, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1747.06s)]
*  checkpoints, targeted agents, opens up a very fertile space for drug development and therapeutic [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1752.02s)]
*  development. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1758.02s)]
*  So there's a great opportunity and those signals will likely share towards the end of the year [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1758.4199999999998s)]
*  at a meeting. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1763.62s)]
*  Obviously you can't say exactly, but what kind of timeline are you hoping for in terms of the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1764.8999999999999s)]
*  ability to get this to more patients? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1770.7399999999998s)]
*  So once we get alignment with the agency and we can trigger a registrational trial. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1774.34s)]
*  So we've always done our trials with a very translational bent. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1779.06s)]
*  So not just looking at safety tolerability, but actually looking at [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1783.3799999999999s)]
*  metrics of efficacy that I described to you. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1786.6599999999999s)]
*  I think this, in terms of expansion and getting into patients, I think this could well be on [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1789.6200000000001s)]
*  its way and planning those sorts of next steps next year, as early as next year. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1794.5s)]
*  And with one or two, the opportunity is pretty significant across many different solid cancers. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1799.8600000000001s)]
*  And these cancers are what I describe in pancreatic is a tough cancer. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1804.34s)]
*  Colorectal is a tough cancer. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1807.94s)]
*  Gastric is a tough cancer. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1809.46s)]
*  Colorectal, you're well aware the increasing incidents, particularly in younger adults [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1810.98s)]
*  in the Western hemisphere, quite remarkable. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1815.46s)]
*  So we feel this actually could provide a very differentiated opportunity for what [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1817.78s)]
*  what are indications and cancers of really clear, imminent unmet medical need. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1821.78s)]
*  And so again, a tremendous opportunity there as well. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1827.3s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing about a Q102 molecule from the other side, from the investigator side. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1830.98s)]
*  These are physicians who have a wide variety of options for their patients that have failed. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1836.42s)]
*  We have a wait list of patients. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1841.7s)]
*  We cannot get them on the trial fast enough [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1843.54s)]
*  because we don't have enough slots available because we're still in the doors escalation phase. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1846.26s)]
*  So that speaks volumes about not only the need, but investigator enthusiasm [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1850.66s)]
*  for this asset and just really thrilled to see that response. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1856.02s)]
*  Hopefully, a few years from now, this is making a difference in terms of [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1859.94s)]
*  curing people and not just extending life by two months or whatever it is. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1864.26s)]
*  That's why that's exactly why I shared with you the median overall survival in the monotherapy. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1869.46s)]
*  The fact you see in a third line, we're expected is going to be far below second line. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1874.8999999999999s)]
*  We're seeing 14 months in north where second line reported by checkpoints is seven to eight months. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1880.1s)]
*  That tells you that tells us and which gives us the motivation that we're doing [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1885.6999999999998s)]
*  substantively something very different than what you just said, which is exactly this little trickle [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1889.78s)]
*  effect. What we want to make is a significant dent in the outcome in obviously favor of the patient. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1896.1s)]
*  Is there anything that we didn't cover that you wanted to talk about? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1902.8200000000002s)]
*  I think we've covered the major aspects again, just to stress, you know, we started with [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1906.5s)]
*  cytokinesis gyms and again, the principle of immune activation necessitates that one has to be [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1909.54s)]
*  selective and selective to the right kinds of T cells. People oftentimes make generalized [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1915.46s)]
*  therapies and I often point out that you cannot expect selectivity and degeneracy in the same [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1921.78s)]
*  molecule. It cannot happen. So you can make degenerate cytokine therapies and we've tried [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1928.02s)]
*  this with IL-2 with many different approaches. I think fundamental immunology tells us that [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1933.94s)]
*  you've got to get this to the right consumer and the right consumer is the anti-tumor T cells. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1939.06s)]
*  I think in essence, that's where the field is headed and in essence, that's what cell therapies [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1943.94s)]
*  demonstrate in sort of a very cumbersome way because you have a monoclonal anti-tumor T cell [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1948.26s)]
*  repertoire that you've created with artificial car receptors or TCRTs but do see responses. So [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1953.46s)]
*  we think we're getting to it with a biological, which I think could be very disruptive to the [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1959.8600000000001s)]
*  space and most of all, you know, from a personal lens, Jim, I'm just delighted for the patients. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ptw4P_37M&t=1963.7s)]
