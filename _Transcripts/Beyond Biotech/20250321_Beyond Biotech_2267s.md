# Mitochondrial therapeutics: The future of aging and neurodegenerative disease?
**Beyond Biotech:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from the Biotech. I'm Dylan Kisane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=0.0s)]
*  and this is episode 140. This week I had the pleasure to talk to Dr. Klaus Dugie from Vandria, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=12.36s)]
*  a biotech developing metophagy in juices that rejuvenate cells by restoring mitochondrial [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=20.84s)]
*  health. Dugie and his team are doing cutting-edge work in mitochondrial therapeutics and indeed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=26.42s)]
*  the company named Vandria even comes from the combination of Van for being on the Vanguard [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=31.980000000000004s)]
*  and Dreah for mitochondria. I hope you enjoy my discussion with Vandria's CEO Klaus Dugie. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=38.22s)]
*  Klaus, your journey through medicine and pharma has been pretty extensive. Can you share a little [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=46.06s)]
*  bit about your background and the career path you had moving up to and leading up to Vandria? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=52.14s)]
*  Sure, my pleasure. So I'm a physician by training. After medical school, I spent four years in doing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=57.1s)]
*  basic research as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda in the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=66.5s)]
*  US in atherosclerosis and molecular biology. Then came back to Europe and spent six years at [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=72.3s)]
*  Heidelberg University Hospital. I received my training there in internal medicine, endocrinology [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=78.62s)]
*  and diabetology. I'm actually still an adjunct professor of medicine and I teach students a few [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=84.14s)]
*  days every semester in Heidelberg still. But then I joined Bergen-Engelheim for almost 15 years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  I started the diabetes area there but later also was for almost six years the global head of medicine [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=98.9s)]
*  and chief medical officer. I had the privilege and luck to help develop and get approved and launch [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=105.82s)]
*  a number of medicines that have a lot of patients these days. Two of those listeners may be familiar [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  with. One is called Jardians. It's the first diabetes drug that showed a reduction in cardiovascular [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=121.1s)]
*  events. And the other one has actually now been marketed by Epi. It's called Skyritzy or Rizakizumab [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=125.34s)]
*  which is an immunology drug. I also received experience or had experience in the more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=132.06s)]
*  commercial area of pharmaceutical industry. I was two years a general manager for Bergen-Engelheim [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  in the UK and Ireland. And then in 2017 moved to Switzerland and joined Farring Pharmaceuticals [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=146.3s)]
*  executive committee as chief medical officer. And now for the last four years I'm with Wendia, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=152.54s)]
*  the chief executive officer but currently also the chief medical officer. I sit also on a couple [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=157.5s)]
*  of supervisory boards in in Boston and in Copenhagen but by far the most of my time I spent [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=163.02s)]
*  at Vandria. So you've had a little bit of experience in it at top pharma companies. What sort of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=170.14s)]
*  lessons did you take from working there that you can apply now at a smaller biotech like Vandria? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=176.46s)]
*  Yeah there's quite a few. I think on the top of my list would be it's all about the people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  To have the right person in the right role that works to his or her best abilities but also has [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=189.66s)]
*  the right soft skills. So passion for work, the agility that it takes etc. And also to build a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=197.18s)]
*  team that works well together. So that is diverse, that's complementary and I think that's the key [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  success factor. Not only pharma that's going to be the same in large and small corporations but [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=217.1s)]
*  that's where I also see one of my key roles as CEO to really put the right team together and make [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=222.62s)]
*  sure that everybody is engaged, wants to learn, wants to work together. So that that will be on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=228.62s)]
*  the top of my list. The second one that comes to mind is the importance of being a learning [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=235.66s)]
*  organization and also learning individually. We all make mistakes. I'm a first-time CEO. I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=244.3s)]
*  will make mistakes, I have made mistakes. It's important to learn from them and as an individual [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=249.82s)]
*  but also as an organization. So we constantly and that was started that I learned at Bering and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=255.98s)]
*  where you do regularly meetings where you say what have we learned? What went well last year [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=262.7s)]
*  or in a certain project and what can we do better next time? And I think yeah there's in quality, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=267.82s)]
*  there's a formal process it's called CAPA so corrective action and preventive action. So if [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  an organization makes a mistake or an individual we have to be transparent, we have to be open, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=280.7s)]
*  we have to have the right mistake culture and correct the mistakes by openly talking about them [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=285.5s)]
*  and then to prevent to making them again. So this way maybe would be in the top of my list. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=291.58s)]
*  So the importance of people and being a learning organization. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=297.26s)]
*  So you mentioned people, the learning, also a little bit of passion in there as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  You brought that to to Vandrea. What sort of gap are you looking to fill at Vandrea? What's something [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  that you can do that you couldn't do at these bigger organizations? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=315.18s)]
*  Also you mean me individually. So yeah as I just mentioned I'm a first time CEO so I can [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=320.86s)]
*  help guide the organization but we're a small team. We're currently 10 people actually with 10 [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  passports so we're a very diverse team. We try to avoid topics like here are actually reporting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=336.38s)]
*  lines as much as possible so I really see myself as a leading a team of a lot of equals. But yeah [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=344.22s)]
*  I think I can bring this experience from having developed or helped to develop a number of compounds [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=351.66s)]
*  from early pre-clinical through clinical development all the way to to approval in the US and Europe [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  and Japan and China and then also to launch them together with commercial colleagues, market access [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=363.5s)]
*  colleagues. So yeah I think I've learned a lot in those 18 years and I'd like to hope I can [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=368.78s)]
*  take some of these lessons to Vandrea and maybe increase the likelihood of success to a certain [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  degree. Let's talk a little bit about Vandrea. Vandrea focuses on mitochondrial therapeutics. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=381.02s)]
*  Why are mitochondria such a crucial target for medicine today? So it's something that we have [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=388.38s)]
*  learned a lot about in the past years and we're still learning. If you look at the number of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=395.9s)]
*  publications year over year it's increasing every year because there's just so much science and so [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=400.78s)]
*  many new discoveries emerging. Why are mitochondria such a crucial target? Well they are the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  powerhouses of ourselves right so we need energy to live. Our cells need energy to function, to divide, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=414.94s)]
*  to operate, to fend off inflammation etc. And the mitochondria is the place where that energy is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=423.58s)]
*  most of that energy is being generated. So that's why they're so crucial and we have learned over [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=432.38s)]
*  time that there's a number of diseases where a less than perfect function of a mitochondria [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=437.58s)]
*  can contribute to the progression of disease and that's why there's been so much attention to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=445.74s)]
*  mitochondria over the past few years as a potential tool to address age-related diseases [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=452.06s)]
*  by improving mitochondrial function. So it's a very exciting area. We're learning a lot, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=457.5s)]
*  we have learned a lot but there's also still a lot to learn going forward. Your lead compound right [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=462.3s)]
*  now has been described as a minophagy inducer. Can you explain a little bit how that works and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=467.82s)]
*  why it's really unique? So yeah it's something that also I had to learn when I joined Vandrea. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=474.14s)]
*  I have to admit I'd never heard of mitophagy so that was something new but it's actually an [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=481.18s)]
*  exciting process so and it's highly selective. So it's a process where the cell recognizes [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=486.62s)]
*  there is a mitochondrion or several of those that don't function as well anymore. We call them [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  damaged mitochondria and there is a machinery in place in the cells that can identify those damaged [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=499.1s)]
*  mitochondria, digest them and replace them with healthy mitochondria. So leading in an overall [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=506.94s)]
*  improved mitochondrial function. It's important to understand that this is a very selective process. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=514.14s)]
*  You often hear the concern well you know you don't want to eat up your mitochondria what's it going [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=520.06s)]
*  to do to the energy in your cells and for instance with our motorvection but I'm sure that's the same [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=524.7s)]
*  for others as well is really selective. So if we treat a healthy cell with our compounds we don't [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=530.7s)]
*  see much happening. If we give a toxin to these cells and then that damages mitochondria then we [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=536.46s)]
*  see dramatic increase in this mitophagy process. There's still the identification of damaged [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  mitochondria, the digestion and the replacement with healthy mitochondria. And maybe one example [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=549.4200000000001s)]
*  to illustrate why this can be so important. For me a seminal manuscript was from the the Willem Bor [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=555.34s)]
*  group in New York that was published in 2019 and they looked at mitochondria in the brains, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=564.22s)]
*  obviously diseased patients with Alzheimer's disease and compared them to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=572.7s)]
*  age-matched healthy controls. And in the age-matched healthy controls about 20 percent [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=577.34s)]
*  of the mitochondria in the hippocampus which is the part of the brain where memory is being formed [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=583.5s)]
*  etc. were damaged. And the Alzheimer patients was 80 percent. So you can appreciate that if we had [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  a process that kind of prevents these mitochondria damage from happening or when it happens it [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=593.82s)]
*  identifies it and replaces it with healthy mitochondria should be a wonderful handle to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=600.94s)]
*  prevent or treat early forms of Alzheimer's disease. And we now learn that this is applicable [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=606.62s)]
*  probably to a number of other diseases as well. Yeah so that's how it works in general. Why is [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  our approach unique? I think that's an important question and maybe I'll focus on two things there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=621.18s)]
*  First of all we believe we're first in class and maybe only in class so we have [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=628.2199999999999s)]
*  discovered a new target that has its own benefits and to the best of our knowledge [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=634.62s)]
*  there's no one else in the in the pharma we currently pursuing it so that that makes us [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=642.6999999999999s)]
*  unique. And the second part I'm going to go back a little bit in time because I think it's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=647.5s)]
*  important for listeners to understand. So 35 years ago the human genome project was started. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=653.18s)]
*  So the endeavor to really decipher our genes, our genetic material, the DNA, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=659.9s)]
*  to hopefully have a handle to better understand where diseases arise and how we can treat them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=667.5s)]
*  It was a hugely successful endeavor and we understand a lot more now about genetic causes [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  of diseases and it helped us to develop gene therapies etc. However we also have to understand [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=678.86s)]
*  that we as individuals we are born and we die with the same set of genes right so nonetheless [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=686.38s)]
*  in our 20s and 30s and 40s most of us luckily are quite healthy but when we then get into our 60s [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=693.02s)]
*  and 70s and 80s the risk dramatically increases for neurodegenerative diseases, for myopathies, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=700.06s)]
*  for other disease states and why is that? And we believe that energy plays a crucial role there. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=707.26s)]
*  Our cells and the mitochondria we talked about that a few minutes ago generate energy that the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=713.5799999999999s)]
*  cells need for all of their processes to fend off inflammation etc. While we age our cells go from [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=719.5799999999999s)]
*  a very efficient way of generating energy ATP or adenosine triphosphate in the mitochondria [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=729.1s)]
*  to a less efficient way of energy production called glycolysis and with that we believe that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=737.26s)]
*  there's less energy available to chaperone proteins to fend off chronic inflammation, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=745.5s)]
*  toxic protein aggregation etc. And we kind of flip this switch back to the efficient [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=751.34s)]
*  way of energy production and help the cells and the tissues or the organs to fend off [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=757.42s)]
*  age-related diseases. And this may sound to you listener well just a little bit of more energy is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=763.42s)]
*  that enough to treat diseases? But yes so we have dramatic efficacy admittedly in animal models of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=768.14s)]
*  disease and if we have the time I'll just give you two examples maybe which I find are very [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=776.2199999999999s)]
*  illustrative. So one way to look at cognitive function in animals is what's it's called a T [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=781.82s)]
*  maze test. So you put a mouse at the bottom of the T and the mouse crawls up and you go left or right [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  you take it back to the bottom of the T and if the mouse remembers I went left last time I'm [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=795.0200000000001s)]
*  going to go right because you know I'm a curious animal and I'm also looking for this elusive piece [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=800.3000000000001s)]
*  of cheese. So young mice remember this very well in about 70 percent of the time they remember [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=804.5400000000001s)]
*  I went left last time I'm going to go right next time. Aged mice don't do that very well anymore so [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=809.66s)]
*  they only remember in about 30 percent of the time. And if we treat those aged mice there's no [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=815.3399999999999s)]
*  pharmacology they're just old mice if we treat them with very low amounts of our compound [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=820.54s)]
*  they go back to 70 percent. So we had old mice learn exactly as fast and as well again as young [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=827.66s)]
*  mice. And the second example and I mentioned Alzheimer's disease before we studied a model [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=834.22s)]
*  that's called the 5x FAD model it has five human mutations that lead to the buildup of amyloid [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=841.1s)]
*  flux and Alzheimer's disease like phenotype in mice and we treated those mice either with the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=848.14s)]
*  vehicle or for eight months with our compound VNA318 and we see a dramatic reduction in the amyloid [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=854.62s)]
*  buildup and much improved cognitive function and behavior. So it seems like the mode of action [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=860.9399999999999s)]
*  is working very well and is sufficient to treat a significant disease for now in rodents right so [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=867.42s)]
*  we now have to show that this works as well in humans and that's the big hurdle as we know [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=873.34s)]
*  but we're very excited that we're now at that stage that we can test our compound in humans [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=878.46s)]
*  and see whether we see efficacy at least to a certain degree like we saw in rodents. Sorry for [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=883.02s)]
*  the long answer but I thought it was important to understand. Maybe you can put it into a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=889.18s)]
*  comparison with other approaches to these neurodegenerative diseases to Alzheimer's. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=895.9799999999999s)]
*  How does your approach compare to what's already out there on the market and what's been developed? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  Yes so we're excited because it looks again also from a clinical profile our approach could be [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=906.6999999999999s)]
*  quite unique. So what has been made available to patients with Alzheimer's disease I think maybe [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=913.1s)]
*  20 years ago is called the choline esterase inhibitors. So it's a drug that helps cognitive [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=920.62s)]
*  function in the short term. So after a few weeks patients or caregivers will feel [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=927.74s)]
*  you know functionality cognitive function is improved however there's no disease modifying [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=935.34s)]
*  effect. So the the cause of the disease isn't changed so unfortunately the cognitive function [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=942.06s)]
*  will decline in those patients over time. So it's like a short-term effect that is important [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=946.6999999999999s)]
*  but it vanes over time because the disease progresses. On the other hand the new [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=952.9399999999999s)]
*  treatments for Alzheimer's disease the monoclonal antibodies against beta amyloid of the first two [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=959.8199999999999s)]
*  actually in fact three have been approved in the US and looks like the first one will also be soon [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=966.94s)]
*  approved in Europe. They don't have an immediate effect on cognitive function but they have disease [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=972.0600000000001s)]
*  modifying properties so they slow the progression of the disease they slow the progression of [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=977.66s)]
*  cognitive decline. But you have to wait six or 12 months to see that even in a clinical trial. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=983.98s)]
*  So what we have shown in my is that we combine the two functions so we have this immediate effect [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=989.18s)]
*  on cognitive function so by improving brain metabolism we can show improved memory and learning [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=994.22s)]
*  within one hour of treatment because the improved energy seems to to help that. But we've also and [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=999.74s)]
*  I mentioned the the 5x FAD model to also show that we reduce inflammation to the brain so [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1005.9s)]
*  also show that we reduce inflammation to the brain so neuroinflammation. We show that we reduce [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1011.74s)]
*  the aggregation of proteins like beta amyloid and we improve mitochondrial function. So we should [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1018.54s)]
*  have the best of both worlds hopefully an immediate impact on improvement of cognitive function plus [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1023.8199999999999s)]
*  then slowing the disease progression and we have evidence that that again works in rodents. It'll [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1030.94s)]
*  be a few years until we know whether that works in humans. So we're talking here about [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1036.78s)]
*  aging obviously in animal models now but later in humans. Aging and chronic disease maybe how do [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1043.18s)]
*  how does Vandrea actually fit into this bigger conversation about longevity around healthy life [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1049.8999999999999s)]
*  years? How do you fit into that and not just talking about disease? Yeah it's a great question [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1055.1s)]
*  and we get invited to longevity conferences and there's less specific venture capital funds [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1061.34s)]
*  who invest in longevity. We're trying to stay a little bit away from that. We really want to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1068.06s)]
*  focus on disease on age-related disease. So I mentioned how the energy level goes down that we [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1072.62s)]
*  can hopefully treat age-related diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, like muscle wasting or [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1078.4599999999998s)]
*  myopathy. But if that's successful then you also have to see the earlier you treat this is probably [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1087.42s)]
*  the better and can we even go to a state where we do prevention of age-related diseases and then [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1095.66s)]
*  you're getting a little closer to this topic of longevity. We really want to focus on health span [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1102.14s)]
*  not on age span but and maybe one more thought on that because we always hear well you know [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1108.7s)]
*  society insurers don't like to pay for prevention. It's actually not true so to give an example [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1116.14s)]
*  if someone has a high cholesterol level or bad cholesterol level LDL then a doctor may prescribe [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1122.8600000000001s)]
*  a cholesterol-lowering drug even if there's no heart disease yet but we know from the long-term [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1129.5800000000002s)]
*  studies that that reduces the risk of heart disease by 30-40 percent or more and because [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1134.3000000000002s)]
*  that's cost-effective insurers will pay for it. If we can have such a similar biomarker for [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1140.54s)]
*  mitochondrial function or the energy level in the cells and can show that if we intervene early we [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1147.42s)]
*  can actually prevent the formation of diseases like Alzheimer's disease then maybe society will [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1154.1399999999999s)]
*  find a way also to pay for that. So that's more the mid to long-term future but for now we really [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1159.42s)]
*  focus on age-related diseases and less on longevity. What about this bigger interest [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1164.46s)]
*  in mitophagy as a therapeutic strategy? How do you see that evolving maybe not just at your company [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1170.94s)]
*  but more broadly right through the industry? Yeah that's a great question and as I mentioned [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1178.22s)]
*  earlier we have experienced some concern you know is that enough to really treat diseases? Is it safe? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1184.3s)]
*  So that's obviously these are important questions and that's why also you have to show the safety [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1192.3799999999999s)]
*  so we are very happy when we received a year ago our toxicity studies where you treat the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1200.06s)]
*  rats and dogs with very high doses. Rats we treated for instance with a 400-fold therapeutic dose [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1205.4199999999998s)]
*  and it was safe. We didn't see any untoward findings which is great but as you said we're [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1212.86s)]
*  not alone and we are excited that we're not alone because this is a big field and an important field [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1219.1000000000001s)]
*  and it will benefit for more than one company to explore that. So we'll give you two examples. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1225.5s)]
*  One company is called Mission Therapeutics. They were the first one to take a mitophagy inducer [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1231.66s)]
*  into clinical development I think about a couple years ago. A second example is a company called [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1238.3s)]
*  Mitokinin that was acquired by by Edvi a year and a half ago. They are also in phase one and we [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1243.66s)]
*  believe we are now the third one in clinical development with the mitophagy inducer. Importantly [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1249.5800000000002s)]
*  these three companies induce mitophagy improve mitochondrial function through different targets. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1255.42s)]
*  So I think it's important because it you could say that's more shots on goal right because [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1261.9s)]
*  you know if you have three different modes of action all hopefully leading to [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1269.18s)]
*  mitophagy then the likelihood is bigger than one or two of them will be successful and we believe [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1274.7s)]
*  that because there's a growing number of diseases where we realize that impaired mitophagy plays a [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1282.14s)]
*  role there's certainly room for more than one or two companies. There's a number of diseases out [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1288.78s)]
*  there and every single company can only pursue maybe you know one or two what the most three [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1295.34s)]
*  disease areas and we can learn from each other right. So I've been to two mitochondrial focused [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1299.98s)]
*  conferences and we talked to each other and you know which biomarker are you using and [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1307.1799999999998s)]
*  how do you see that and what's your experience with regulators. Sometimes people perceive [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1311.6599999999999s)]
*  pharmaceutical industry as you know only competitive and you know we want to you know use elbows and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1316.4599999999998s)]
*  be the first is actually much more collaborative than people think and we want to learn from each [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1321.82s)]
*  other and exchange ideas and thoughts obviously as long as it's not anti-competitive but I think [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1327.1s)]
*  we can learn a lot from each other. So I'm excited that now there's three companies in the clinical [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1336.06s)]
*  development stage of a mitophagy inducer and yeah hopefully we learn a lot more over the next [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1342.3799999999999s)]
*  one or two years already. Well you just mentioned certain biomarkers that different companies are [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1349.26s)]
*  pinpointing. You've also talked a little bit about neurodegenerative disease and Alzheimer's. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1355.1s)]
*  Are there particular biomarkers or patient populations where you think you're going to [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1360.14s)]
*  have the most impact or the first impact? It's a great question so I had the privilege at [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1364.7s)]
*  Buring to start the area of translational medicine where we try to use biomarkers to identify [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1371.42s)]
*  patient populations that have a better benefit risk profile than maybe you know an all-comer [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1378.46s)]
*  population. So it's a topic that's very close to my heart. It's not an easy topic. It's not so easy [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1383.82s)]
*  to measure mitochondrial function or impaired mitophagy and that's why I said that's an area where [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1390.54s)]
*  we need to work together with others and learn from each other. But I also mentioned inflammation. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1397.42s)]
*  That chronic inflammation is part of that aging process that we think we can tackle. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1404.7s)]
*  So inflammatory biomarkers are you know there we know a lot more. Like there's the non-specific one [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1410.8600000000001s)]
*  which is called C-reactive protein in Alzheimer's disease. There's one that we can measure in the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1416.6200000000001s)]
*  stereospinal fluid that's called YKL40 and that's what we want to learn. So we are planning to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1422.06s)]
*  do a study with Harvard Medical School at Mass General Hospital where we look at biomarkers in [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1429.3400000000001s)]
*  Alzheimer's patients and ideally learn and see other biomarkers that help us understand is there [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1434.94s)]
*  a subpopulation and I think that's where you were going with your question that could have a better [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1441.66s)]
*  benefit risk profile with our drugs. And to give you maybe one more example we're working with [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1446.8600000000001s)]
*  Professor Steven Arnold at Harvard Medical School and he looked at markers of mitophagy [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1453.66s)]
*  and autophagy in the cerebral spinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients and it looked and these are [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1461.26s)]
*  early data that there is a population where these markers may be increased and it could be that those [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1467.8200000000002s)]
*  are patients that would benefit more from the mitophagy in users than maybe other people [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1474.3000000000002s)]
*  because Alzheimer's like so many is a multifactorial disease and not every patient [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1480.62s)]
*  will have exactly the same reasons why they develop Alzheimer's disease. But in 30 days we [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1485.34s)]
*  need to learn and want to learn a lot and that's why it's so exciting also to work with experts [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1491.4199999999998s)]
*  like Professor Arnold from Harvard and obviously there's many more to learn together to bring the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1497.82s)]
*  best brains if you will to the table and discuss the clinical development strategy, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1504.62s)]
*  the biomarkers, what is the right patient population to test in a clinical trial. So [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1510.7s)]
*  exciting days we can do it alone we need the help from others but we hope to learn a lot more in [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1517.1s)]
*  the years to come. Well exciting is one thing but there's got to be some challenges there as well [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1523.74s)]
*  it's not all plain sailing it's not all easy to do. What sort of challenges are you facing [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1530.86s)]
*  there at VanDrea right now? What's slowing things down? A great question let me think of a few. So [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1536.78s)]
*  I already mentioned that some investors have concerns is this a motor vaccine that has enough [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1545.4199999999998s)]
*  efficacy could it have safety issues and I already mentioned that we were very happy to see the [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1551.02s)]
*  toxicology data and I have no doubt that the same is that vision therapeutics and [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1557.66s)]
*  microkinesis otherwise they weren't allowed to go into the clinic. So I think that that concern will [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1561.18s)]
*  diminish over time. A second one comes to mind our font runner is a CNS compound we wanted to go into [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1566.06s)]
*  the brain and for that it needs to be lipophilic which means it's not so soluble in water so you [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1574.1399999999999s)]
*  need to go through some hoops and find a formulation that it actually makes it soluble enough that it [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1581.26s)]
*  gets absorbed in the gut and can get into the brain and have activity there and then we needed [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1586.3s)]
*  quite a bit of activity and that was that was quite a challenge. And I think the third one comes back [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1592.3799999999999s)]
*  to an earlier question what are the right biomarkers? How can we early show that we have [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1598.3799999999999s)]
*  that we move the needle on the process that we want to for inflammation mitochondrial function [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1605.5s)]
*  important aggregation so we spent a lot of energy and had a strong focus over the last 12 months on [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1610.86s)]
*  developing the the clinical biomarkers that help us to also early on identify what is the dose [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1618.2199999999998s)]
*  range we want to test in clinical trials. Is there signs that something is happening which we need to [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1625.4199999999998s)]
*  to get allowance to go into other trials but also to attract further capital [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  to move our development compounds further. So yeah there's absolute challenges so far so [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1640.14s)]
*  good we now are in the clinic that's exciting but like in all areas in pharmaceutical development [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1646.46s)]
*  it's never easy but that makes it fun as well. Yeah I mean you talked a little bit before about [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1653.98s)]
*  how there's people in the longevity field who are really interested in what you're doing and maybe [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1659.82s)]
*  you're less interested in in serving that particular market right now. What about another [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1664.22s)]
*  market that's really interested in these these sort of therapies that's in the performance [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1668.7s)]
*  enhancement the resilience. Is there any scope for you to be working in those areas do you think [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1672.78s)]
*  you'll be offering therapies in that sort of space as well? So I fully understand where you're coming [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1678.7s)]
*  from when I say we give the cells the energy back that they need to treat age-related disease you [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1685.1000000000001s)]
*  could also say well maybe if a muscle has more energy maybe the muscle can the person can jump [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1691.66s)]
*  higher or further or kick the ball harder and that may be but that's an area that we leave for [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1696.46s)]
*  others we really want to focus from on age-related diseases it's a long journey right I think people [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1704.94s)]
*  sometimes underestimate it takes 10 to 15 years from idea generation to bring a new drug to [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1710.6200000000001s)]
*  market and most of them fail on the way so that's really where our focus needs to be to attract the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1719.02s)]
*  investment to move forward to work with the right consultants to identify the right patient [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1725.3400000000001s)]
*  populations and hopefully help to address significant unmet medical need in patients [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1731.5s)]
*  that can benefit from that so that that's going to be our focus and we leave the other topics [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1737.82s)]
*  to others. So you're in the clinic now what sort of milestones should we be looking for from Van [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1744.22s)]
*  Dreier right in the next couple of years? Yeah that's a great question so we're currently in [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1750.3s)]
*  the first in man studies so obviously the focus there is safety and tolerability and so far so [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1756.46s)]
*  good we've just endorsed the first cohorts and haven't seen any untoward findings which is in [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1762.78s)]
*  line with the toxicity data that I shared with you but in some days so we've only started the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1767.82s)]
*  trial a couple of months ago so we still have a few months to go through but the first outcome [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1773.02s)]
*  will be hopefully that our drug is safe and tolerated then we obviously look at [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1777.9s)]
*  pharmacokinetic parameters does enough of the drug get into the bloodstream that it can actually have [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1785.3400000000001s)]
*  an effect and importantly we are working as mentioned on biomarkers so hopefully we can show [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1792.7s)]
*  that we switch on some genes in mitochondria that we switch off others which are maybe [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1798.6200000000001s)]
*  pro-inflammatory that we don't want to have so that's the more midterm goal that the [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1805.66s)]
*  short-term goal is really safety and tolerability and then next year we want to go also to really [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1813.66s)]
*  show efficacy we're planning a study where we induce a cognitive impairment by sleep deprivation [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1819.9s)]
*  I was at JP Morgan in San Francisco nine hours time difference I can tell you sleep deprivation [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1827.66s)]
*  does lead to cognitive impairment and we want to show that our compound has benefit there and then [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1832.78s)]
*  we want to go also in patients and I mentioned the Alzheimer's study that we're doing this is [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1841.1s)]
*  going to be a short-term study first four weeks maximum three months again be driven by biomarkers [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1848.86s)]
*  we will explore the cognitive function and I mentioned the dual mode of action hopefully we [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1854.54s)]
*  can see something already in four weeks we will look at the inflammatory biomarkers that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1859.58s)]
*  you and I discussed just a few minutes ago so that's really what we can be looking for in the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1865.1799999999998s)]
*  next two to three years from Vandrea now as well as Vandrea you mentioned there are a couple of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1871.26s)]
*  other companies working in this domain as well is this eventually going to become do you think [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1876.9399999999998s)]
*  a mainstream approach in medicine this mitochondrial medicine so I think it has the [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1882.54s)]
*  opportunity to become that as I mentioned early days neither mission therapeutics nor mitochondria [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1891.02s)]
*  nor Vandrea has yet had the chance to explore efficacy in longer-term trials but because we [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1898.78s)]
*  learn more and more about impaired mitophagy mitochondrial dysfunction to be at the heart of [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1907.42s)]
*  so many diseases I would be very surprised if we don't see some patient populations at least that [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1912.78s)]
*  will benefit from that and because it's such a general poster that plays a role in so many cells [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1919.8200000000002s)]
*  tissues and organs I think yes if we can if we can show also longer-term trials today's efficacy [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1926.22s)]
*  it is a safe approach then I think it has a good chance to become a mainstream approach in [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1935.26s)]
*  medicine there's by so exciting to be one of the first three companies that gets into the clinic [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1941.1799999999998s)]
*  so very exciting times let me let me draw you back out now and look at something a little bit [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1945.82s)]
*  of a bigger picture you've worked at bi you've worked at faring you've worked at top pharma now [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1952.06s)]
*  you're in a smaller more innovative biotech can you maybe tell me how does the innovation process [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1957.1799999999998s)]
*  differ at a top pharma firm versus your 10-person firm now what does it look like [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1962.62s)]
*  yeah so obviously it's it's less formal right I remember as in any big pharma company you [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1969.1s)]
*  start this have two or three day committee meetings where everything's being reviewed [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1978.3s)]
*  you have a group full of 20 30 people and maybe everything has been said but not by everyone yet [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1982.78s)]
*  and so you can lose a lot of time decision making typically is slow in big pharma and you [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1989.58s)]
*  always see these restructuring processes and the McKinsey's and bcg's coming into big pharma and [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=1997.1799999999998s)]
*  how can we increase the decision making speed etc so that's an issue we don't have we have a small [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2002.6999999999998s)]
*  management team four or five people we meet every week twice and we take decisions quickly and if [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2009.34s)]
*  it's big decisions obviously we have to align with our board and with our chairman but most [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2017.26s)]
*  decisions we can take ourselves so the agility is really a main advantage on the other end in [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2022.14s)]
*  big pharma you will have all the experts right you will have a member when i've developed my [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2029.9s)]
*  first diabetes drug you had an expert for analytics and experts regulatory and experts for toxicology [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2034.54s)]
*  etc we don't have that with 10 people so we have to work with consultants we have to work with co's [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2039.82s)]
*  and yeah part of the magic is to find the right consultants and the right co's that really [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2046.14s)]
*  bring the experience the expertise to the table that have the right tools that work with the right [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2053.42s)]
*  quality so that that's a that's a big difference as well but the main thing and that's why i [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2057.82s)]
*  probably could not go back to to big pharma is the agility and the speed decision making and [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2065.42s)]
*  and i really enjoyed it a lot i have to say yeah maybe if we we continue on this idea of [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2070.46s)]
*  what's exciting then if you can look a little bit forward maybe 10 years 15 years you said is is [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2077.1800000000003s)]
*  what it really takes from id to fruition where do you see vandria in that 10 or 15 years [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2083.9s)]
*  so um yeah so so what excites me is that we will see clinical data not even in 10 to 15 years but [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2091.98s)]
*  maybe two or three years from permission by to kind of vendia if you ask me about vandia in 10 [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2100.06s)]
*  years um that's a long time for biotech right so most biotechs won't get there but our ambition [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2104.94s)]
*  is really to to address unmet medical need and in the best of worlds and if i we know if i may [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2111.58s)]
*  dream a little bit then we would bring this unique dual mode of action um to patients with Alzheimer's [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2117.82s)]
*  disease and significantly slow down their progression and if we treat them early enough [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2125.58s)]
*  maybe keep it in a state that keeps them fully functional and and and and enjoy life for that [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2129.9s)]
*  we would need a big pharma partner we can't do this by ourselves but there's another disease [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2136.14s)]
*  we're working on it's called sporadic inclusion body myositis it's the most frequent myopathy after [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2140.62s)]
*  the age of 50 it's a very rare disease so we think that we can develop ourselves so the dream is to [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2145.9s)]
*  maybe bring two medications to to the market and and help patients that need to to be [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2153.1s)]
*  to live better longer lives and finally i guess a broader question for people who are really [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2160.14s)]
*  following along with this mitochondrial research what sort of developments what sort of breakthroughs [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2166.3799999999997s)]
*  should they be paying attention to how can we separate the the signal from the noise [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2171.42s)]
*  that's that's a great question so yes we need and we'll learn more about biomarkers to identify [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2175.5s)]
*  patients who can benefit better there's also we haven't had time to discuss but there's also [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2182.7s)]
*  mitochondrial diseases so disease states that are due to effect in mitochondrial DNA or [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2188.78s)]
*  mitochondrial proteins but i think that as and you alluded to that at the end the the the [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2193.98s)]
*  proof is in the pudding right so you need the clinical data so that's what really the will [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2199.58s)]
*  be the make or break can we with the mitochondrial approach with a mitophilia approach [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2205.18s)]
*  show in an appropriately designed clinical trial that patients benefit from that approach that's [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2211.18s)]
*  i think what we we need to look out for and that's what i'm optimistic we will we and others will be [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2218.38s)]
*  able to demonstrate in hopefully just a few years sounds good clausto thanks for joining us on [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2224.54s)]
*  beyond biotech thanks a lot for the interest that's it for this episode don't forget to check out all [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2231.98s)]
*  the latest news and analysis at lebiotech.eu i hope wherever you are in the world you have a great [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2240.14s)]
*  week ahead thanks for listening and i hope you'll join us again next time for another beyond biotech [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMInSwM_hdY&t=2246.54s)]
