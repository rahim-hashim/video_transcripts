# Humacyte: Saving lives with lab-grown blood vessels in conflict zones
**Beyond Biotech:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dylan Cassane and this is episode 153 for the podcast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=11.0s)]
*  Humisite is a company worth watching. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=16.96s)]
*  They are pioneering a platform that enables the investigation, development and manufacture [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=19.6s)]
*  of bioengineered human tissues and organs that are designed to be universally implantable, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=24.84s)]
*  off the shelf and regenerative with the goal of treating a wide variety of diseases, injuries [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  and chronic conditions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=36.4s)]
*  This week I had the chance to speak to Humisite founder, president and chief executive Laura [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=38.92s)]
*  Nicholson about the company she's built, the science she's driving forward and the real [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=44.4s)]
*  world applications for Humisite's lab-grown blood vessels in some of the most devastating [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=49.76s)]
*  and dangerous conflicts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=55.04s)]
*  I hope you enjoy our discussion. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=57.08s)]
*  Laura, welcome to Beyond Biotech. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Dylan, it's great to be here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=62.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to start by getting you to introduce yourself to our audience a little bit and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=66.28s)]
*  tell me how you actually moved from growing up in Illinois right through teaching, research [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=70.36s)]
*  to eventually founding Humisite. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  Talk to me about that, Joni. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=78.7s)]
*  Well I guess it's a long answer to that, but when I was a little girl I always wanted to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=81.9s)]
*  be a physician and I wanted to invent things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=88.62s)]
*  Those were two things that I very much wanted to do and I would say that stuck with me all [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=92.18s)]
*  the way through adulthood. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=97.98s)]
*  In my medical training I trained as an anesthesiologist and an intensive care unit doctor because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=100.34s)]
*  I was very interested in caring for the very ill and I was also very interested in trying [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=106.38s)]
*  to figure out how we can support patients better who have tissues and organs that are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  failing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=117.78s)]
*  That really led me into the whole field of tissue engineering in the mid-90s, which is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=119.2s)]
*  what we now call regenerative medicine. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=124.5s)]
*  Because vascular disease kills so many people, it kills more people than any other disease, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=127.34s)]
*  more than cancer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=132.3s)]
*  I became very interested in trying to figure out if we could grow replacement blood vessels [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=134.34s)]
*  for humans and so that's what I've spent the last 30 years trying to do. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  Like you say, you've been working in this field for decades. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  Was there something particular that drew you into the vascular world? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  Well I guess I would say that again, blood vessels are so central and important obviously [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=155.5s)]
*  to human health and I think we all know that but there is one particular case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=161.82s)]
*  I was taking care of a patient when I was a resident in Boston at Mass General and this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=166.82s)]
*  was a patient who was having a heart bypass. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=173.14s)]
*  To do a heart bypass, to replace clogged arteries on the heart, we typically take veins out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  of the leg to do those replacements. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=182.5s)]
*  So I can remember I was standing at the head of the bed and taking care of this patient [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=185.62s)]
*  and the patient, the chest was open and the surgeons went to the right leg and opened [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=189.14s)]
*  up the right leg and looked at the vein and said, that's no good and closed up the incision. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=195.14s)]
*  They went to the left leg, opened up the left leg from top to bottom, looked at the vein, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=201.38s)]
*  said that's no good, closed it up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=206.66s)]
*  They then went to the left arm, opened up the arm thinking they would take an artery [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  out of the arm, decided that wasn't good, closed that incision and then they made a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  fourth incision and they basically extended the incision from the chest into the abdomen [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=218.66s)]
*  and took a vessel off the stomach to put it onto the heart. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  And watching that whole process, it really seemed barbaric. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=228.74s)]
*  It seemed like we were doing so much damage to the patient in efforts to help the patient [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=232.6s)]
*  and I just became very interested in trying to answer the question, well, can we, instead [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=237.66s)]
*  of injuring the patient to get a vein, can we, can we grow a new artery for someone who [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=241.9s)]
*  needs one? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  It's incredible really. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=249.5s)]
*  I mean, this is, this is one of the top hospitals that I assume some of the top surgeons as [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=250.5s)]
*  well and we're still digging around just trying to find a vein that we can use. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=256.06s)]
*  Well and, and not only that, but you know, heart bypass surgery started in the 1960s [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=262.14s)]
*  and in the 1960s we were digging around in the leg to take out vein to do the bypass. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  It's now 2025 and that's exactly what we're doing 65 years later. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=273.9s)]
*  So certainly surgical techniques have gotten better, but you know, the whole area of finding [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=279.62s)]
*  a blood vessel replacement, that's been a really hard problem. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=285.73999999999995s)]
*  And this is where Humacyte comes in. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=290.5s)]
*  You started with what, a $150,000 loan in 2006. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=292.7s)]
*  Now you're a public company. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=298.17999999999995s)]
*  How did you actually scale? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  And I guess to go back to the start, what's the mission of Humacyte? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=301.46s)]
*  Well the mission of Humacyte is really to be able to provide the patients and surgeons [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=306.9s)]
*  something I like to call spare parts for people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  These are replacement tissues, initially blood vessels, but we hope to grow other types of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  tissues over time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  Blood vessels that can be literally taken off the shelf and used in any patient at the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=323.84s)]
*  time that the patient and surgeon need them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  So that's really our mission. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=331.38s)]
*  As far as the start, I had been working in this field for about 10 or 12 years when in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=333.86s)]
*  2005, after I had moved to Duke University, I decided to spin out Humacyte because I felt [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=340.78s)]
*  like we had a line of sight. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=348.82s)]
*  We hadn't solved all the scientific problems, but I felt like we had a line of sight to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=351.62s)]
*  being able to put together a recipe for growing new human blood vessels. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=356.62s)]
*  And so I started with just a couple of my students and a technician, and there was four [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=363.94s)]
*  of us and we got a loan. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=369.14s)]
*  But we also, frankly, took money from friends and family for years and we wrote grants to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=371.8s)]
*  the NIH and to other departments in the federal government, to the Defense Department, and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=377.46s)]
*  we just bootstrapped it up and cobbled it together. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=383.66s)]
*  Is this a real niche play, something very unique, or are there others working in this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=388.3s)]
*  regenerative space as well? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=392.12s)]
*  There are certainly other companies that are working in regenerative medicine and even [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=394.98s)]
*  in regenerative blood vessels. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  I'd like to say, and I think it's true, that we're about 10 years ahead of anybody else [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  who's trying to do this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=406.74s)]
*  Being a public company that just became public a couple years ago, sometimes I think of us [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=410.3s)]
*  that we were sort of flying under the radar for a number of years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=415.94s)]
*  And when we became public, then it became clear to a larger number of people what we [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=421.22s)]
*  were doing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=425.76s)]
*  And we're pretty far ahead of the pack, I've got to say. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=426.76s)]
*  And you're mainly working in the United States or you've got a global reach as well? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  So our clinical trials have been done in the United States, multiple countries in Europe, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  and we've also treated war wounded people in Ukraine. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=442.18s)]
*  We started doing that a couple years ago. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=447.02000000000004s)]
*  Currently, we are approved our engineered blood vessel, which we call the ATEV, which [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  stands for Acellular Tissue Engineered Vessel. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  The ATEV is approved for use in patients with traumatic injury in the US only. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=459.62s)]
*  You've also partnered, if I read this right, with Fresenius Medical Care, and they work [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=465.86s)]
*  in dialysis. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=470.66s)]
*  Has that helped you to scale as well, have you been working closely with them? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=472.42s)]
*  Well Fresenius became interested in Humicite and our engineered blood vessels really as [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  a potential new conduit for patients who have kidney failure who are on dialysis. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=483.22s)]
*  Because when you're on dialysis, what you need is a connection between an artery and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=488.46000000000004s)]
*  a vein that nurses can access with needles and perform dialysis three times a week. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=492.82s)]
*  We've been testing our blood vessel as an access point for hemodialysis for more than [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=499.74s)]
*  a decade. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=504.58s)]
*  And Fresenius, when they've seen some of our data, has been very interested in that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=505.94s)]
*  So yes, they're a wonderful partner for us. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=509.78s)]
*  And they've certainly helped us understand the landscape of dialysis patients and which [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  patients are in the greatest need for having better access. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=519.96s)]
*  I guess it says something about the importance of vascular health, that you're working in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=524.44s)]
*  dialysis, you're working in traumatic injuries, you're in humanitarian aid over there in Ukraine [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=534.72s)]
*  I mean, is there a limit to what you can work on? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=535.72s)]
*  Well, I'd like to say no, that there's no limits. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=538.84s)]
*  But I will say that in addition to the trauma clinical trials and dialysis clinical trials, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  we've also conducted phase two trials in peripheral artery disease, which is where the arteries [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=549.28s)]
*  in the leg are blocked. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=554.24s)]
*  And that can cause pain and can lead to amputation. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=556.72s)]
*  We've done some very exciting work there showing that we can help many patients avoid amputation [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=560.84s)]
*  and keep their limbs. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=566.2s)]
*  We've also been working in animal studies with a smaller version of our blood vessel [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=568.12s)]
*  that's actually the right size for a human heart. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=573.36s)]
*  And it kind of takes us back to that case that I told you about 30 years ago, where [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=576.48s)]
*  we're now making blood vessels that we hope to test in heart bypass for patients sometime [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=582.36s)]
*  next year. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=587.7s)]
*  Maybe you can walk me through a little bit of the science. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=588.7s)]
*  It sounds incredible, the sort of applications you have. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=591.96s)]
*  But when it comes to the science, how do you create and grow these tissues? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=594.52s)]
*  Well, it really all starts with vascular cells. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=600.2s)]
*  If there's anything that I've learned in the last 30 years, it's that human cells are a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  lot smarter than we are. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=610.88s)]
*  They're very intelligent about the programs that they can execute and the way that they [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=613.56s)]
*  can make a new tissue, even in the laboratory or in our manufacturing system. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=618.12s)]
*  But the key is to have the right cells and also to give them the right cues, the right [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=623.86s)]
*  set of stimuli so that they execute their program and go from being individual cells [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=629.24s)]
*  to being a whole blood vessel. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=635.68s)]
*  So we've worked for decades to identify the right cells, the right vascular cells, and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=637.86s)]
*  we actually have a bank now of vascular cells that can support our production for the next [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=643.8s)]
*  30 or 40 years. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=649.0s)]
*  So we've sort of got that piece nailed down, I think. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=651.52s)]
*  And then over the last 20 years, we've really been optimizing the conditions that we have [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  to show these cells so that they become a human artery. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=660.68s)]
*  So we have a degradable scaffold that the cells attach to, and that defines the size [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  and the shape of the artery that we grow. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=671.88s)]
*  We also, while the cells are growing in our bioreactors, we stretch them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=674.52s)]
*  We stretch them in a cyclic way, in a way that mimics your heartbeat, because every [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  time your heart beats, your arteries stretch a little. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=684.4s)]
*  And as it turns out, we learned almost 30 years ago that if we don't stretch these cells [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=687.76s)]
*  properly, they don't know that they're supposed to form an artery. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=692.76s)]
*  It's an important cue. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=696.24s)]
*  And so we also provide other growth factors and nutrients, and this is really the secret [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=697.86s)]
*  sauce that helps us guide these cells to form a new tissue. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=702.68s)]
*  How about the integration with the body, though, and actually becoming functional once it's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=708.04s)]
*  implanted or surgically implanted, you know, it's implanted into a living person, living [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  blood vessels, the rest of an entire system. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=719.36s)]
*  How does that work, the integration? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=722.28s)]
*  Well, the integration is another key piece of this technology. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  And going along with the integration, it's the lack of rejection. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=730.88s)]
*  So, as I mentioned, we have a cell bank that we use to make these arteries. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=734.92s)]
*  But what we also developed, in addition to figuring out how to coax the cells to make [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=739.4s)]
*  a new artery, after they make the artery, we also spent several years figuring out how [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=744.52s)]
*  to wash the cells back out of that artery, which sounds a little counterintuitive. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=750.68s)]
*  But really, after we do that, the artery that's left behind is really just proteins. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  It's proteins that those vascular cells made like collagen. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=761.92s)]
*  And what we found is that if we do a good job of washing the cells out of the engineered [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=766.12s)]
*  artery, then we found two things. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=771.2s)]
*  One, we can implant it into anybody. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=774.04s)]
*  And we haven't had a rejection episode yet. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=776.52s)]
*  We've been we've treated more than 600 patients over more than a dozen years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=779.04s)]
*  And we've never seen an episode of rejection, which is exciting. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=783.84s)]
*  But in addition, because this blood vessel after it's implanted has no cells in it, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=788.4s)]
*  my my my vision is that it sort of looks like an empty apartment building to the cells in [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=794.76s)]
*  the body. And what we've seen over time is that cells from the patient migrate into that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=800.4s)]
*  empty apartment building, that empty blood vessel, and turn it into a living artery over [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=805.7199999999999s)]
*  time, which is very exciting. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=810.1999999999999s)]
*  One of the big differences with your approach is that it's actually real human human tissue, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  real human cells, because they've been synthetic ones before. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=817.9599999999999s)]
*  What's the big advantage of your approach versus a synthetic blood vessel? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=822.44s)]
*  Well, certainly, as you point out, there have been synthetic blood vessels that have been on [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=829.12s)]
*  the market since the 1960s and 70s. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=833.44s)]
*  These vessels are Dacron and Teflon. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=836.2s)]
*  So these are all materials that we're used to in terms of clothing and frying pans. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=840.12s)]
*  And these these materials also function as vascular conduits. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=845.96s)]
*  Blood vessel replacements. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=851.76s)]
*  But some of the limitations of these materials are that you can't really use them in smaller [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=853.44s)]
*  diameters like for heart bypass because they clot because it's plastic. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=858.88s)]
*  And if you put a tiny plastic tube in the bloodstream, it does clot. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=864.64s)]
*  But in addition, because it's because these materials are plastic and they don't degrade, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=869.6s)]
*  they're also subject to infection. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  So bacteria can can adhere to these plastics and then it's very hard for the body to clear them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=877.12s)]
*  So so we believe we have some advantages with respect to clotting and with respect to to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=883.0s)]
*  infection. But I would also say that our vessel is easily available. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=890.36s)]
*  So like a plastic raft that a surgeon can pull off the shelf, our vessels are stored in the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=896.76s)]
*  refrigerator and literally the nurse or the physician can pull it off the shelf and open the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=902.0s)]
*  packaging and use the vessel when they need it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=906.8s)]
*  How long does it actually take to develop one of these vessels to the point where it can go and [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=910.28s)]
*  sit in the refrigerator and be ready? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=915.52s)]
*  What's the time scale? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=917.0s)]
*  Well, our whole manufacturing process is about 10 weeks, 10 or 11 weeks end to end from the time [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=919.16s)]
*  we take a small vial of cells, just one or two million cells and and thaw them and grow them out. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=925.0s)]
*  We then use that small vial of cells to grow batches of vessels 200 at a time. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  So we grow 200 blood vessels at a time and then that that growth process takes a couple of months. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  Then we decellularize them and then we test the batch. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  And if the batch passes, then we send it out to hospitals and clinics. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  How big is a batch? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=952.4s)]
*  How many are we talking about? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's 200 vessels at a time and each vessel is about 40 centimeters long and six millimeters in [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=955.68s)]
*  diameter. So again, what's amazing to me is that we're able to start with a small vial of cells. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=963.0s)]
*  Each vial is about a fifth of a teaspoon. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=969.68s)]
*  It's a little tiny volume. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=972.12s)]
*  But from those cells, which have tremendous growth capacity, we're able to generate 200 arteries that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=974.12s)]
*  can help 200 patients. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=981.0s)]
*  Now, Humicide was founded in 2004. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=983.44s)]
*  You've been at the helm right from the beginning there. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=986.24s)]
*  You know, this initial spark that you that you had and the idea that you had coming out of academia, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=989.48s)]
*  did you overcome any skepticism? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=995.32s)]
*  Were there people who thought that this might not work? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=997.5600000000001s)]
*  And plus, we've had these synthetic ones already for 30 years. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1000.0s)]
*  Why do we need to build something new? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1003.2s)]
*  Well, the second part of your question, it's very interesting. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1006.36s)]
*  The vascular surgery community has talked about the biological arterial replacement, especially for [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1010.28s)]
*  small diameters. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1019.52s)]
*  They've talked about that as being the holy grail of vascular surgery since before I started working on [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1020.96s)]
*  this. So so the clinical need has been clear to surgeons for decades. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1026.4s)]
*  But yes, was there skepticism about whether this would work? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1031.28s)]
*  Absolutely. And when I first started writing, when I was still in academia, I was very interested in [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1034.44s)]
*  academia and was writing grants to the National Institutes of Health to try to support this [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1039.12s)]
*  research. There was a lot of skepticism that that maybe this wouldn't work, even when we had shown [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1045.04s)]
*  initial proof of concept in animals. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  So it did it did take some convincing, that's for sure. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  Was there a particular point along this journey now that you've got some FDA approvals and, you [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1056.4399999999998s)]
*  know, was there a point where you just got that boost of confidence and said, OK, I'm sure now that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1062.12s)]
*  we're on the right the right track, everyone's going to see that this is going to work. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1067.6s)]
*  Well, I guess I guess if I was going to talk about one point, I guess I would talk about after we [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1074.48s)]
*  went in into our first clinical trials. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1081.28s)]
*  So we treated our first patient who was a dialysis patient in Poland in 2012. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1084.4399999999998s)]
*  And actually, our first phase one, two trials were in dialysis and in peripheral artery disease. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  And we had, of course, tested the vessels really extensively in the laboratory and in animals, in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1098.1599999999999s)]
*  nonhuman primates. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1105.56s)]
*  But when you first go into patients, it really is a whole new it's a whole new world. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1107.9599999999998s)]
*  And what I like to tell people is that I didn't sleep very well for the first year because you [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1113.7199999999998s)]
*  never know how it's going to work in patients until you test it in patients. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1120.32s)]
*  And that's that's just the reality. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  But I guess I would say after a year when we really saw nothing unexpected and the vessel was just [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1125.6s)]
*  working as we expected, as we had seen it work in large animals. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1132.1599999999999s)]
*  After a year, I thought, yep, we're here. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1136.04s)]
*  We've arrived. It was December twenty twenty four when you got your FDA approval for [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1139.36s)]
*  vascular for the use of the vessels in vascular trauma. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, what were the challenges there for you navigating that regulatory pathway? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1149.92s)]
*  Particularly because in that whole period, Covid was was taking over and Covid was what [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1155.0s)]
*  everyone was talking about. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1160.4s)]
*  And some of these other things maybe got pushed a little bit to the side. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1161.84s)]
*  Well, certainly Covid was a challenging time for all of us, including biotechnology [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1167.0s)]
*  companies, because, you know, people it was hard to get people to come to work. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1171.96s)]
*  And also, frankly, enrolling our clinical trials really slowed down because a lot of non [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1176.8s)]
*  emergency care just got pushed off to the side. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1183.44s)]
*  But I will say that we're very grateful to the Defense Department in the United States. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1187.8s)]
*  It's the Defense Department because of our results that we had shown in animals and [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1193.72s)]
*  patients, the Defense Department became very interested in the possibility of having this [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1199.8s)]
*  vessel available for wounded warfighters. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  And so they actually gave us a a priority designation with the FDA in 2018. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1208.24s)]
*  And that really moved us up the the importance scale, I think, for the Food and Drug [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1216.2s)]
*  Administration. And so we were able to work closely with the FDA to design a single arm [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1221.68s)]
*  trial that would allow us to test this vessel in traumatically injured civilians, which [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1227.2800000000002s)]
*  we did in the US and in Israel. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1233.24s)]
*  There had actually never been any kind of randomized clinical trial, not even a [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  prospective or a controlled clinical trial in vascular injury ever done ever. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1240.44s)]
*  That's because it's really hard to do. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1246.84s)]
*  You know, if you have if you have a patient with a major vascular injury from a car [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1249.08s)]
*  accident or a gunshot wound and they roll into the emergency room, they're literally [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1253.84s)]
*  at this time, they're literally bleeding to death and getting consent and getting [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1258.76s)]
*  consent and and trying to do a clinical trial in that setting is extremely challenging. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1263.76s)]
*  But we had support from the FDA and from the Defense Department. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1269.56s)]
*  And we moved forward and our trials showed good results. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1273.52s)]
*  It's interesting to hear that about the DOD, because a lot of the people that I talk to, if [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1277.76s)]
*  we're talking about the US government and their impact on the biotechnology industry, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1281.88s)]
*  we're talking about the FDA, we're talking about the NIH. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1286.68s)]
*  But it sounds like the DOD could actually be a really important player, at least in some areas [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1290.3600000000001s)]
*  of the biotech industry and getting their help and their support could be important to [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1295.44s)]
*  moving forward. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1299.92s)]
*  Well, I certainly think so. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1302.28s)]
*  I mean, the Defense Department is very mission driven, as we all know and understand, and [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1303.64s)]
*  protecting their warfighters and repairing wounded warfighters is right up on the top of [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1309.92s)]
*  their list of priorities. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1315.84s)]
*  And, you know, they do have situations in combat that are very difficult to study in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1317.68s)]
*  typical randomized prospective controlled clinical trials, because, you know, war is [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1324.04s)]
*  not like a prospective randomized clinical trial. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1330.2s)]
*  And so the Defense Department has been very focused on trying to find ways to get [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1333.2s)]
*  products available to treat wounded warfighters in a way that's also consistent with all of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1339.8s)]
*  the other regulatory frameworks that we have here in the US. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1345.84s)]
*  Can the vessels be taken into the field quite easily? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1350.32s)]
*  Or is there a chain, a cold chain that's needed, a hospital that's required? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1353.8s)]
*  So our vessels are used by vascular surgeons and trauma surgeons. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1360.24s)]
*  So I think the concept that our vessel would be used literally out in an open cornfield, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  that's not exactly right. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1372.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, our vessel is used, you know, as part of a surgical procedure. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1374.52s)]
*  So it's used in a hospital or a forward medical operating location. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1378.52s)]
*  Our vessels are refrigerated. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1383.72s)]
*  They're not frozen, but they are stored refrigerated and they have a shelf life of 18 [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1385.8400000000001s)]
*  months. So that means that if there's a refrigerator nearby, which all hospitals and [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1390.76s)]
*  operating rooms have, then our vessel can be stored there. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1396.4s)]
*  Talking about combat, and you mentioned before that you had done some work in Ukraine and [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1399.36s)]
*  your vessels had been used for trauma in the Ukraine conflict. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1404.2s)]
*  Tell me how you came to be involved there. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1407.96s)]
*  How was it that Humicide happened to become involved in a conflict over in Europe there? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1410.52s)]
*  Well, as I mentioned, we actually started our clinical trials in dialysis and in peripheral [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1417.92s)]
*  artery disease in Eastern Europe. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1423.28s)]
*  And the vascular surgical community is actually a pretty small community. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1426.4s)]
*  There's only, for example, there's only 3000 vascular surgeons in the entire United [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1430.44s)]
*  States. And the same is true across Europe. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1434.68s)]
*  You know, vascular surgeons know each other. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  And so our conduit was well known to many surgeons in areas surrounding Ukraine, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1440.44s)]
*  particularly Poland. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1446.68s)]
*  So after Russia invaded in February of 2020, we had a very large number of surgeons [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1448.88s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1455.52s)]
*  And we had about a hundred and twenty-two, I guess it was. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1456.36s)]
*  Then then what happened was about a month later, we started getting emails from surgeons [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1461.36s)]
*  in Ukraine who knew about the vessel and who were seeing so many terrible war injuries [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1467.12s)]
*  and seeing a lot of amputations. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1472.76s)]
*  And this is this has been written up in The New York Times, the number of amputations [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1474.7199999999998s)]
*  that have been seen in Ukraine. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1478.36s)]
*  So those surgeons were very interested in whether or not they could get our vessels [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1480.28s)]
*  and they worked with the U.S. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1484.64s)]
*  FDA with their international office and asked for permission to ship our vessels to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1485.68s)]
*  Ukraine. You know, we were not approved at this time, so we had to get permission for [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1491.24s)]
*  that. And the FDA responded very quickly within a week. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1495.92s)]
*  And then we worked out, as you say, the cold chain shipping the vessels into Kiev and [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1499.8000000000002s)]
*  then the Ukrainian Ministry of Health helped distribute them to other forward operating [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1504.8400000000001s)]
*  locations. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1510.5200000000002s)]
*  And did you have to work with surgeons remotely or this was handled by people on the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1512.0s)]
*  ground? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1516.48s)]
*  So we did have to work with surgeons remotely. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1518.24s)]
*  And one of my favorite parts of the story is that so we do have one of our employees [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1521.44s)]
*  at Humisite is actually a Ukrainian trained physician who speaks Ukrainian, which is [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1527.16s)]
*  very handy for us, because when we develop training materials for surgeons, we couldn't [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1532.3999999999999s)]
*  send any of our staff or any surgeons to Ukraine to train them in person on how to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1538.64s)]
*  use the vessel. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1543.0800000000002s)]
*  So we had to do all of our training over virtually over video chat and we had to do [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1544.3600000000001s)]
*  it in Ukrainian. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1551.64s)]
*  So we developed a set of teaching tools and language specific materials to teach the [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1553.16s)]
*  surgeons how to take the vessel out of the packaging and the best implantation techniques. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1559.24s)]
*  And it worked very well because their outcomes in Ukraine were outstanding. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1564.48s)]
*  What is the learning curve there? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1568.8000000000002s)]
*  How long how much training do people have to go through to actually use the vessels that [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1570.48s)]
*  you produce? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1575.4s)]
*  Well, I like to say that the training is about one case. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1577.6000000000001s)]
*  If you speak to surgeons about how the vessel handles, you know, again, vascular surgeons [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1581.6000000000001s)]
*  and trauma surgeons, they're used to sewing human arteries and veins. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1586.76s)]
*  They do it all day long. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1591.0s)]
*  And if you ask a surgeon how our vessel feels, they'll tell you it feels kind of like a [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1592.24s)]
*  normal human artery. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1597.48s)]
*  So once they get it out of the packaging, which is one of the big training parts of [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1599.4s)]
*  this, but once they get the get it out of the packaging, it actually handles very easily [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1604.56s)]
*  for them. And I would say that it's about a one case learning curve and then they [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1609.44s)]
*  understand it and they can work with it very well. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1613.2s)]
*  Working with people in Ukraine is in particular these trauma surgeons. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1617.0s)]
*  That's some real world case study that might have taken a long time to collect in the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1621.44s)]
*  United States. You mentioned you work in Israel as well. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1626.8s)]
*  How is that data? How is that feedback from the surgeons change things or how has it [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1630.36s)]
*  helped you to redefine exactly how these vessels might be used and in what situations [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1635.32s)]
*  they might be used? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1640.04s)]
*  Well, I do think to your point, the outcomes in Israel where we treated, I can't [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1642.32s)]
*  remember, maybe four or five patients, and then in Ukraine where we treated a total of [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1647.56s)]
*  19 patients. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1652.04s)]
*  Overall, those outcomes were outstanding. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1653.44s)]
*  And again, for all of those surgeons, we train them remotely. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1656.0800000000002s)]
*  And so I think it shows that, number one, that the vessel can can be used fairly easily [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1660.88s)]
*  by anyone with vascular surgical training. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1666.64s)]
*  But it also shows, to your point, many of many of these patients sustain terrible [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1669.88s)]
*  injuries. These photos, we can't we can't share a photo on a podcast, but unfortunately, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1674.96s)]
*  there are some pretty graphic photos of some of the horrific IED blast injuries that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1681.64s)]
*  some of these folks have suffered in Ukraine and Israel. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1687.2800000000002s)]
*  And being able to restore circulation and save the limb in a very contaminated wound [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1689.8400000000001s)]
*  environment can really make the difference between amputation and avoiding that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1696.2800000000002s)]
*  This work that you're doing in particular in a combat zone like in Ukraine, how does [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1702.48s)]
*  that feedback into the mission of the company and the people who are working from [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1707.6000000000001s)]
*  the side? They see the real world good that the product is doing. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1711.08s)]
*  They see the real world good that the asset is making in the world. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1715.3999999999999s)]
*  How does it feedback into the mission? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1718.72s)]
*  Well, we've had I think the Ukrainian experience, but also even our clinical trial [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1722.0s)]
*  experience here in the US is very inspiring for people. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1727.12s)]
*  I think seeing that, you know, of the patients that we treated in Ukraine, despite some [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1733.1999999999998s)]
*  terrible injuries, there were no amputations and there were some patients who were not [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1738.4s)]
*  expected to survive. But instead, we have a photo of one particularly badly wounded [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1742.64s)]
*  patient walking out of the hospital. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1748.16s)]
*  So when when people on the ground at human site can see that, that's that's very exciting [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1750.96s)]
*  and motivating for sure. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1757.44s)]
*  But I'll tell you, we've also had patients who we've treated in our clinical trials or as [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1759.6000000000001s)]
*  compassionate use cases here in the US where I believe we've absolutely been limb and [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1765.52s)]
*  life saving. And some of these people, for example, we have one woman who we treated in our [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1770.7199999999998s)]
*  clinical trials who was a dock worker in in New Jersey and was crushed by a crane. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1775.76s)]
*  Her leg was crushed by a crane and the injury was horrific and she sustained terrible wound [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1781.9199999999998s)]
*  infections. But the vessel kept kept right on right on chugging along. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1788.8799999999999s)]
*  And now she's a she's a beautiful woman working, you know, working a job and walking around in [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1793.28s)]
*  high heels. So it's it's when you can see that upfront and personal, it's it's very [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1798.8s)]
*  important for our employees. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1805.76s)]
*  You've got your FDA approval now for the vascular trauma use case. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1808.32s)]
*  You know, what are your goals as a as a CEO now that you've you've got this approval? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1813.6s)]
*  What's the next step? What do you see moving forward? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1818.08s)]
*  Well, we're very excited about our collaboration with Fresenius and about our next indication, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1820.08s)]
*  which we hope will be in dialysis access. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1826.24s)]
*  So we just last fall, we reported positive outcomes of a phase three study. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1829.1999999999998s)]
*  This was a prospective randomized study where we compared our vessel for dialysis access to [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1835.36s)]
*  the standard of care, which which is called a fistula, which is where the surgeon goes into the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1842.32s)]
*  arm and sews an artery in a vein directly together. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1847.2s)]
*  So that's the gold standard for dialysis access. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1852.56s)]
*  But those operations often fail and they don't produce a good blood vessel that patients can use [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  to dialyze. So we showed positive outcomes where our vessel performed better over the first year [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1862.48s)]
*  in dialysis patients overall. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1870.08s)]
*  So we're very excited about that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1871.92s)]
*  We're just as excited about a follow on study that we're currently enrolling, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1874.32s)]
*  which is a first of its kind study just in women who have kidney failure, because interestingly enough, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1879.92s)]
*  if you do this fistula operation in men, you have actually a much higher success rate than you have [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1888.16s)]
*  in women. So women, maybe because their blood vessels are smaller, have have a much harder time [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1894.0s)]
*  getting good, stable dialysis access. And this can be very damaging to their health and their [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1900.32s)]
*  well-being. So we're conducting in women and we're really focusing on dialysis patients [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1906.0s)]
*  who really struggle with access and who are in and out of the hospital with infections and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1913.2s)]
*  access failures because we think we can help these folks. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1917.6799999999998s)]
*  So we've got trauma, dialysis, you're looking at applications in coronary bypass as well, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1921.9199999999998s)]
*  pediatric heart surgery, I mean, is there anywhere that you're not looking or an area that [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1928.56s)]
*  you hope to move to that you haven't got to quite yet? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1933.92s)]
*  Well, at the risk of sounding like we're trying to do too much, I don't think we are, but we've also [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1938.48s)]
*  been involved in large animal studies looking at using our blood vessel as a delivery vehicle for [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1946.08s)]
*  pancreatic islets. So patients with type 1 diabetes don't make insulin. And the reason for that is [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1952.4s)]
*  that their own immune system kills off the cells in their pancreas called the islets, which make [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1958.8000000000002s)]
*  insulin. So their body can't make insulin anymore and they have to inject themselves multiple times [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1964.4s)]
*  a day. Transplantation of islets has been something that we've been doing for years, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1969.52s)]
*  but those transplantations have a high failure rate because the islets after we inject them, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1976.72s)]
*  say, underneath the skin, those islets don't get enough oxygen to survive. So we're exploring [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1982.32s)]
*  whether or not we can use our blood vessel basically as a delivery vehicle and put islets [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1989.12s)]
*  on the outside of the blood vessel so that when it's sewn into an artery, those islets get enough [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=1994.96s)]
*  oxygen and nutrients to survive. We have some proof of concept studies going on in animals right now [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2000.56s)]
*  that are very exciting. So at some point, it would be great to also look and see if we can [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2007.36s)]
*  help patients with type 1 diabetes. One of the challenges in bioengineering is always [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2013.4399999999998s)]
*  getting up to scale. So creating the first few vessels takes a long time, but over time, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  the manufacturing improves and the scale grows, except the scale of cases for dialysis, for [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2026.8s)]
*  coronary bypass, for vascular disease in general is enormous. How do you scale to address that sort [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2035.84s)]
*  of global need? Well, you're right. I mean, scaling any biologic therapy, whether it's an antibody [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2042.08s)]
*  or a protein or a tissue, is one of the big challenges across all of biotech. I would say [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2050.16s)]
*  that we've been embracing this challenge for a number of years. And as I mentioned earlier, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2057.84s)]
*  we do have actually a highly automated system now that allows us to grow 200 blood vessels at a time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2065.52s)]
*  And the system is really, it's a large incubator. It's about as big as a school bus. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2072.88s)]
*  And we can run that incubator and run about 10 batches, I'm sorry, five batches per year. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2080.08s)]
*  So since each batch is 200 vessels, each of our incubators can grow about a thousand vessels per [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2088.32s)]
*  year. Right now in our building, we have eight of these incubators installed. So that means our [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2093.44s)]
*  maximum capacity is about 8,000 per year. However, we've got room just in this building to install [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2099.76s)]
*  another 30 or 35. So we estimate that just in this building, our total production capacity [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  could be 40,000 vessels per year. So from our standpoint, it's really about having the scale [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2112.88s)]
*  technology, which we've spent years and millions developing, which I believe we have in hand, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2119.68s)]
*  but also having enough cells, enough starting material to do that. And again, we spent more [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2126.56s)]
*  than a decade developing a very large cell bank, so of multiple donors. So I think we can scale. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2132.7999999999997s)]
*  This certainly sounds like you're up for the challenge. It sounds like you're up for the [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2142.56s)]
*  scale. Laura, I want to thank you for talking to us today and thank you for joining us on Beyond [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI2IEi9K_uo&t=2145.76s)]
