# Biosimilars and what’s new in cell and gene therapies
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 82. I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from the Biotech. This week, Fran Gregory, Vice President of Emerging Therapies [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=16.0s)]
*  at Cardinal Health will tell us not only about the company but also its annual biosimilars report [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=23.0s)]
*  and attending advanced therapies week in Miami Beach, Florida last month. Could you tell me a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  little bit about Cardinal Health and what you do there? Yeah, sure. Cardinal Health is a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=37.24s)]
*  healthcare company that is known for distribution of pharmaceuticals as well as a global manufacturer [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=42.2s)]
*  and distributor of medical and laboratory products. And in addition to those really [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=48.36s)]
*  distribution services that we provide, we also are a provider of performance and data solutions [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=54.12s)]
*  for healthcare facilities. So we really offer healthcare providers and facilities solutions [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=60.44s)]
*  to help make their practices more efficient and effective. We view ourselves as a crucial link [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=65.72s)]
*  between the clinical and the operational sides of healthcare and we work to deliver end-to-end [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=71.32s)]
*  solutions to the healthcare providers that we serve as well as our pharmaceutical manufacturers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=76.36s)]
*  Cardinal Health has been in business for over 50 years. We have almost 50,000 employees now and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=81.48s)]
*  we really seize the opportunity to continue to learn and grow every day in the healthcare space. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=88.2s)]
*  My role at Cardinal Health is to oversee a combination of functions within our specialty [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=93.88s)]
*  solutions segment which we call Emerging Therapies. So my organization, Emerging Therapies, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=98.84s)]
*  we consider kind of two areas to be emerging therapies. One being the biosimilar segment [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=105.4s)]
*  which have only been on the market since 2015. So biosimilars are, you know, emerging to the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  market. They're still relatively new. They've been around for less than 10 years. And then the second [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=118.28s)]
*  area of emerging therapies that I'm responsible for is our Cell and Gene Therapy Center of Excellence. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  So this is known as Advanced Therapy Solutions. The first cell and gene therapy, it was actually [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=129.32s)]
*  cell therapy, to lodge in the world and in the US was in 2017. So again, less than 10 years ago. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=135.08s)]
*  So both of these areas are really important to Cardinal Health and to the pharmaceutical industry [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=142.12s)]
*  and obviously most importantly to patients. When you talk about those emerging therapies [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  and the things that you do, does that mean that you produce those? That's a great question. We [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=153.0s)]
*  do not actually manufacture pharmaceuticals in the cell and gene therapy space currently, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=158.36s)]
*  but what we do is really we provide end-to-end resources for the manufacturers that we work with [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  and the provider sites that we service. So it's really, you know, from the beginning when we're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=170.92s)]
*  looking at manufacturers that have pipeline products that they're researching, we have a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=177.32s)]
*  regulatory team that works with that part of their organization to really help consult on FDA meetings, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  BLA filings, anything from their phase one, two, three clinical development programs. We really [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=191.48s)]
*  can't provide consultant services to help get that product through to commercialization. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=198.44s)]
*  Once that product is commercialized, that's really where we are involved again in distribution and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=203.72s)]
*  logistics and financial risk management and in really making sure that product gets to the right [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=208.83999999999997s)]
*  patient at the right time. With these products being extremely, critically volatile temperature [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=215.4s)]
*  wise, some of them require temperature storage down to negative 190 degrees Celsius and they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=221.32s)]
*  volatile as far as their time of stability or their, you know, the duration of time that they can be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=228.28s)]
*  left at any given temperature. So they need to get to the treatment center on time to the right place [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=234.36s)]
*  and to the right patient with a level of precision that I've never seen before in the world of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=241.0s)]
*  pharmacy. So we work a lot with providers and manufacturers for logistics and then finally we [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=247.48s)]
*  also have reimbursement support programs as well as travel and lodging kind of logistics support [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=253.32s)]
*  programs for the patients themselves. And then finally we work a lot with manufacturers and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=259.08s)]
*  providers on real world evidence studies. We have actually the largest real world evidence study [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=265.8s)]
*  in progress. We're following approximately 500 patients in the largest CAR T cell therapy real [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  world evidence study that exists. So we're not only involved in a small piece of this process, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=278.12s)]
*  we're really involved end to end and you know one of the things that we're developing right now with [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=285.0s)]
*  a number of organizations is really creating that value story around cell and gene therapy products. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=290.12s)]
*  How do we show not only the real world evidence but the total cost of care and the pharmacoeconomic [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=296.52s)]
*  value of these products and really framing that up in new ways for payers and even for government [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=303.24s)]
*  payers as well. It was interesting when you mentioned about the fact that you've got [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  staff in many different countries and also things like temperature issues must be kind of not [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=315.32s)]
*  difficult but there must be challenges involved with just the logistics. Absolutely yes that's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=321.88s)]
*  something that we take into consideration every day at Cardinal Health not only for our cell and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=327.72s)]
*  gene products but many specialty products require temperature controlled environments. Cell and gene [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=332.76s)]
*  are kind of like ultra sensitive I would say so we definitely are keeping a much closer watch on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=338.12s)]
*  them. They require a much higher level of information, chain of custody, chain of identity, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=345.32s)]
*  types of things that need to occur with cell and gene therapy products so we know exactly where [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=351.8s)]
*  they are, who has custody of them, at what time throughout the process. So absolutely many resources [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=356.92s)]
*  go into making sure that those high cost products get to the right patient at the right time and at [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=362.68s)]
*  the right temperature and that the product is stable when delivered. How important is innovation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=367.08s)]
*  to Cardinal Health? Cardinal Health is extremely committed to innovation being that we've been in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  business for over 50 years and we are still one of the industry leaders in providing pharmaceutical [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=379.0s)]
*  distribution services and manufacturing and distribution for medical products. I think you [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  have to be innovative. I think some of the areas where we're showing that we are continuing to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=392.36s)]
*  innovate is in the cell and gene therapy space. We are absolutely working to lead the market here [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  and really we call ourselves the innovation partner for our pharmaceutical manufacturers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=405.16s)]
*  So we really want to continue to find new solutions to new challenges that are presented to the health [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=411.64s)]
*  care system every day, not only in cell and gene but very broadly across healthcare. How can we work [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=417.8s)]
*  with our partners, whether those be pharmaceutical manufacturers, our provider networks, how can we [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=423.88s)]
*  continue to innovate with you to make the system better, to make the system more efficient, more [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  effective and most importantly to make sure that patients get the care that they need every day. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=434.2s)]
*  One of the things that I noted from the strategy that you have is lowering healthcare costs to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=440.04s)]
*  improve access to life-saving medication. How do you work toward achieving that? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=445.48s)]
*  Sure, this is one of my favorite areas. Honestly, this is where I feel very passionate. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=451.48s)]
*  Having a long road of experience and interest in the financials of healthcare, I really do feel [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=456.68s)]
*  like there is a need for some kind of a break to the healthcare system. We can't keep spending at [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=464.44s)]
*  the rate that we are and I think we all hear very frequently that the US healthcare system at the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=471.08s)]
*  rate that we're going is somewhat, if not completely unsustainable. So if you look at just some [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=477.64s)]
*  numbers, I'll rattle off some numbers here and these numbers are important to the work that I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=483.32s)]
*  do every single day at Cardinal Health. We hear all the time the spend on biologics is increasing at [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=487.32s)]
*  an exponential rate. In 2022, the US spent $252 billion on biologics alone, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=494.76s)]
*  which represents almost half of all pharmaceutical spending. We hear these stats all the time. It's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=501.88s)]
*  half of all pharmaceutical spending is going towards these biologic products, but it only [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=507.16s)]
*  accounts for about 2% to 3% of the total prescriptions that are written. If you think [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=513.64s)]
*  about that, that's a huge number and it's growing every year. Then the flip side of that is think [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=519.08s)]
*  about biosimilars. Biosimilars are in the market. They're here to stay. The purpose of biosimilars is [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=524.36s)]
*  to lower healthcare costs on biosimilars and improve access. Biosimilars are expected to save [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=531.72s)]
*  the healthcare system over $180 billion through 2027. Remember that number. Through 2027, biosimilars [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=538.44s)]
*  are supposed to save the healthcare system $180 billion. The current costs of biosimilars are [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=547.32s)]
*  totally living up to these expectations. I think when biosimilars first came to market, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  some of the earlier biosimilars did not reflect huge price discounts off of the reference products. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=561.88s)]
*  However, in the past year, even in the past six months, we have seen some extremely convincing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=568.2800000000001s)]
*  cost discounts off of reference product prices in the adalumimab space. Some of the most recent [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=575.08s)]
*  biosimilars that have launched have actually exceeded 85% off of the price of the reference [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  product. Huge discounts that are extremely meaningful, not only to the healthcare system, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=588.6s)]
*  but ultimately to improving access and creating a more sustainable environment for pharmaceuticals [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=595.32s)]
*  moving forward. So kind of flip that and look at the extremely expensive innovative products. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=601.0s)]
*  If you think about the cell and gene therapy products that we just talked about a little bit, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=610.36s)]
*  from 2024 to 2027, cell and gene therapies will have cost the system, the healthcare system in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=614.84s)]
*  the U.S. only, and again, we're talking about the U.S. here, around $70 billion. So [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=621.88s)]
*  $27 billion of that will occur in 2027 alone. So these are conservative estimates, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=628.12s)]
*  assuming that products do get approved as we expect them to get approved and that the FDA indeed [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=635.16s)]
*  holds up their commitment to approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapies per year over the next [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=641.0s)]
*  couple of years. We expect to see $70 billion in spend on cell and gene therapies through 2027. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  And remember that number of savings for biosimilars, $180 billion through 2027 [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  in savings. So when I hear concerns about the cost of cell and gene therapies and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=660.76s)]
*  concerns over the sustainability of the healthcare system because of cell and gene therapy products, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  my messaging is and my thoughts are that if we could, as a country and as a global community, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=674.2s)]
*  improve the uptake and optimize the uptake and the utilization of biosimilars, that savings alone [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=682.76s)]
*  could fund the innovative products that are coming to market in the cell and gene therapy space and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=689.24s)]
*  any other innovative products that might come to light with the amazing research that's being done [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=694.44s)]
*  right now in medicine. So if you think about just the financials and kind of the numbers, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  I know this is way simpler math than an actuary or an economist might put together, but if you just [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  think about some of the savings opportunities that we have right in front of us with biosimilars [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=711.08s)]
*  that are happening now, and if we all work together to optimize those, we can really create this kind [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  of financial space for this innovation to occur. So I think that's why my role at Cardinal Health [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  is much different than anyone else. I think I have the coolest job because I get to see [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=728.12s)]
*  some significant savings coming out on one side of the healthcare system and some huge costs [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  coming as well, and really being able to balance that from a financial perspective with what's [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=738.52s)]
*  happening in healthcare. Because you're a global company, every country has its own rules, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=744.52s)]
*  regulations, it must be tough to keep on top of that, but also useful for your clients that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=750.52s)]
*  you have a finger on that pulse. Absolutely, it's really important for us to know exactly what's [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=756.92s)]
*  happening in the industry. Again, my focus is on biosimilars and cell and gene therapy products, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=762.6s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that as a pharmacist I don't want to know about every single [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=769.24s)]
*  new technology or innovation that's happening in medicine. There are some fascinating things [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=774.28s)]
*  going on outside of my areas of expertise currently that certainly have a huge impact [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=778.36s)]
*  on global healthcare costs and global healthcare outcomes. Speaking of innovation, how do you, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=783.64s)]
*  and I don't necessarily mean you personally, but the company, how do you stay in touch with [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=790.04s)]
*  what's new in drug discovery and do you get involved in that? That's one of the areas that [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  is extremely important in our line of work and probably everyone's line of work is knowing what's [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=800.52s)]
*  coming in the future and making sure that we are prepared and that we're proactive in everything [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=806.52s)]
*  that we're doing. We're really building for the future. I'll speak to that specific to my areas [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=812.76s)]
*  of expertise being biosimilars and cell and gene. If I think about how do we stay up to speed in [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=818.44s)]
*  innovation and development, drug discovery, in the biosimilar space, it's much different from what we [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  do in the cell and gene therapy space. I'll walk through those. For biosimilars, there are a lot of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=833.1600000000001s)]
*  knowns. With biosimilars, we know, typically we know launch dates. We know when patents are going [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=840.36s)]
*  to expire with some ambiguity that surrounds that, of course, but we have some information [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=848.92s)]
*  regarding patent expiry and we have some idea of what types of patents would be upheld versus what [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=854.04s)]
*  types of patents might not on certain reference products. For biosimilars, we are really tracking [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=862.84s)]
*  less clinical development and more patent expiration, more litigation [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=871.48s)]
*  outcomes. We are tracking what happens in patent dance processes. We are tracking what's happening [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=878.9200000000001s)]
*  in any settlements that are occurring between organizations for launch dates. Of course, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=888.04s)]
*  we're tracking the FDA approvals. I'd say out of all of those, the most difficult one to track [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=894.28s)]
*  is the litigation. We hear publicly the results of some of the trials that go on between manufacturer [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=901.48s)]
*  of biosimilars and reference products. However, it takes a little bit of digging into some resources [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=910.8399999999999s)]
*  that some expert resources that we have access to, to be able to really understand what's going on [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=917.64s)]
*  in some of these very complex cases. It's interesting when you think about biosimilar [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=924.28s)]
*  development, the actual development program for a biosimilar being primarily analytical [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=929.4799999999999s)]
*  and not as much on the clinical development and clinical trial space, we really aren't tracking [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=937.4799999999999s)]
*  that so much as we're tracking the political environment surrounding the biosimilar. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=943.88s)]
*  That's how we stay up to speed on biosimilar development. Of course, we work with these [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=950.6s)]
*  manufacturers every day to ensure that we're ready for their product when it comes to market. We're [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=955.8s)]
*  ready to contract for their product so that providers can have instantaneous access to their [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=961.64s)]
*  products when they're available commercially. That's part of what we do every day as well. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=965.64s)]
*  But that tracking before the commercial availability is probably the more complex [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=971.72s)]
*  part of what we do most days. Setting biosimilars aside for a moment and moving into the cell and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=978.36s)]
*  gene therapy side, this is a completely different world. Cell and gene therapy development is [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=984.28s)]
*  extremely new. Every pharmaceutical manufacturer that is developing a cell or gene therapy [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=990.36s)]
*  is doing something a little bit different. There is new science being discussed every day, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  new technology platforms, new cell therapy development capabilities. We are really [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1005.72s)]
*  tracking these in a completely different way. Most of the way that we track our cell and gene [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1013.08s)]
*  therapy are obviously news outlets specific to cell and gene therapy. There are a number of [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1018.2s)]
*  podcasts out there that are specific to cell and gene therapy where certain developers are [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1024.92s)]
*  being interviewed. Those are extremely helpful to stamp on what are the new manufacturing [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1030.28s)]
*  techniques that are being discussed, what is the new technology from a scientific perspective that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  is being evaluated, what sounds promising, and let's follow that. We do follow the pipeline [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1042.92s)]
*  very closely. We have a very analytical pipeline process that we track companies and molecules [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1050.68s)]
*  that we think look promising and we follow those through every single step of the development [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1058.52s)]
*  pathway. Oftentimes our regulatory consulting part of our organization is getting involved with those [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  companies earlier and actually working with them to help them get that product through to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1069.96s)]
*  commercialization. We are tracking them from an even closer perspective in the case where [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1075.56s)]
*  we are partnering with them on regulatory consulting. We also attend many conferences and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1081.08s)]
*  industry events. Those are very helpful just to maintain relationships with the organizations [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1086.84s)]
*  that are developing these products, making sure that we know where they are and if they need our [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1092.2s)]
*  consulting guidance, any of the services or products that we provide. We are working close [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1096.84s)]
*  with them to provide those. The interesting area in this space is investor activity. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1101.32s)]
*  Many of these small companies that are developing maybe one or two cell or gene therapy products, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1108.52s)]
*  a lot of these are smaller companies that are very scientific in nature. Following the investment [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  activity that is happening around these organizations can also be an early indicator [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  of how these products might fare in the long term. We also pay close attention to any FDA advisory [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  board meetings, making sure that we know what the outcomes of those meetings were and again how that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1132.76s)]
*  looks as we compare it to the molecule and what we know about the molecule and the science involved. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1138.52s)]
*  Then finally global approval. Sometimes we look at global approvals and that implies that other [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1143.96s)]
*  countries will be following. Most of the time a product is not only approved in one country but [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1150.76s)]
*  we can kind of see if it's approved in one area or region anticipating where it might be approved [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1157.24s)]
*  next. So kind of tracking it that way as well. So we are involved very early with these manufacturers. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1163.32s)]
*  Most of these small manufacturers we know them well. We talk to them often. They need a lot of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1168.6s)]
*  resources due to the fact that many of them are small and again we want to innovate. We are their [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1174.12s)]
*  innovation partners and we will be there to innovate with them and help them fill what gaps [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1179.24s)]
*  they might have along the development life cycle. You mentioned the biosimilars and you produce a [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1183.96s)]
*  report every year. I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about that. Yeah sure we do. This is [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1189.16s)]
*  one of our most exciting I think publications that we do especially in the biosimilar space. There's [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  a lot of change that happens very quickly in the biosimilar space and the biosimilars report [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1202.84s)]
*  attempts to capture not only what's happening currently but what we think the big trends will [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1208.84s)]
*  be in the year to come. So this will be our third annual biosimilars report. We will be releasing [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1213.16s)]
*  that here in the next few weeks. We really use this report as a service to help educate the broader [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1219.24s)]
*  health care and really the general public about biosimilars. Every year we select topics of interest [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1225.32s)]
*  to clinicians and others which are timely and relevant to the market. I think what's unique [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1231.32s)]
*  about our biosimilars report, I know there are a couple of other biosimilars reports out there that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1237.4s)]
*  I find very valuable as well, but I think where ours is different is that we not only provide [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1242.6000000000001s)]
*  analytics and reporting on what is happening currently. So this year for example will provide [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1249.64s)]
*  some analytics and some insights regarding the adaluma mad market, how it's developing so far, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1255.8000000000002s)]
*  as well as some of the formulary impacts on biosimilars. So those are kind of report outs, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1263.16s)]
*  their database, their insights driven, but we also uniquely we interview health care experts [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1269.48s)]
*  in different areas of emerging biosimilars. So if we look to the future and the pipeline [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1278.44s)]
*  of biosimilars we will select a few therapeutic categories where we see being kind of hot [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1285.3200000000002s)]
*  topics for biosimilars in the coming year and we will interview experts in those areas and create [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1292.3600000000001s)]
*  surveys and data as a result of those interviews so that the reader can have a really good [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1301.0s)]
*  understanding of how health care providers are thinking about their products. It's a blend of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  scientific information, of data and insights, as well as kind of hot topics and what you need to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1314.68s)]
*  know about biosimilars going into the coming year. I know it's kind of impossible to summarize the [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1322.8400000000001s)]
*  entire industry, but what are you seeing as the current cell and gene therapy space? Yeah, so I [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1329.64s)]
*  think one of the most important things to understand is in cell and gene therapy, you know, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1336.76s)]
*  we kind of say cell and gene therapy as one thing, but it's actually multiple different things. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1341.0s)]
*  So when we think about cell therapy, we have a couple different types of cell therapy. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1345.96s)]
*  Autologous is when the person's own cells are used as a product to manufacture the treatment [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1350.6s)]
*  and then allogeneic, which is where a donor's cells are used to generate a product or a treatment. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1358.04s)]
*  And then gene therapies are a little bit different. They're not actually using [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1365.48s)]
*  just the cells, but they're using the cells and the genetic material within the cells to modify [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  the genetic material within the cells in some way. So cell and gene therapies are definitely kind of [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1374.8400000000001s)]
*  combined together because they are very, sometimes there are cell and gene therapies in one product. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1381.0800000000002s)]
*  The genetic material and the cell therapy is kind of combined. So that's why we talk about them [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1387.4s)]
*  together because they both have come to market at the same time. They both are using human cells [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1393.0800000000002s)]
*  and genetic material as an input to manufacturing a treatment for a patient. So it's definitely [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1399.16s)]
*  new science, new innovation, and very quickly evolving. So if I think about, you know, another [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1407.0s)]
*  key point of the cell and gene therapy market right now, I mentioned previously the first product was [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1415.0800000000002s)]
*  approved in 2017. I think there are about 20 cell and gene therapy products on the market today, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1421.24s)]
*  and I think I say about 20 because the FDA categorizes cell and gene therapies a little [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1426.36s)]
*  bit differently than what most commercial organizations categorize cell and gene therapies. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1432.84s)]
*  So when we look at cell and gene therapies, we're talking about treatments that Cardinal could [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1437.9599999999998s)]
*  potentially be a partner of the manufacturer. And it's almost a more, you know, I hate to say [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1443.7199999999998s)]
*  traditional medication, but it's a treatment that goes through a pathway that Cardinal Health finds [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1448.1999999999998s)]
*  complementary to the services that we provide. Right now, among those 20 cell and gene therapy [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1454.52s)]
*  products that are approved and commercially available on the market, there are a number [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1459.96s)]
*  of different indications. I think one of the misnumbers that some people might have in the [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1464.36s)]
*  cell and gene therapy space is that cell and gene therapies are for oncology conditions or for cancer. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1468.36s)]
*  That is true in some cases. Many of these products are indeed for different types of [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1474.84s)]
*  cancer indications. However, we also have several treatments available on the market that are for [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1479.72s)]
*  conditions like hemophilia. Sickle cell disease is a very popular one. There were two products [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1487.24s)]
*  recently approved in December for sickle cell disease. And we also have extremely rare diseases [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  being treated outside of the hematology or oncology sector with some of these new gene therapy products. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1498.1200000000001s)]
*  So the treatment paradigm is extremely broad. And the types of providers that are involved in [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1506.04s)]
*  providing these types of therapies to patients is broad and becoming more broad as we speak. So I [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1513.24s)]
*  think that's really exciting. I think the most exciting part is that patients who have never had [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1519.1599999999999s)]
*  any option for any kind of relief from their disease are finally having hope. So I think [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1524.04s)]
*  that's the most exciting part of the science and this technology. If we look at the future of cell [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1531.72s)]
*  and gene therapy products, I think we are barely touching the tip of the iceberg with what we have [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1538.28s)]
*  on the market currently. Most of the cell therapies we have on the market today are autologous, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1544.44s)]
*  again, meaning they require the individual to donate cells to create the dose of medication. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1550.1200000000001s)]
*  And these are done one at a time. So one patient at a time receives their medication and it's [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1557.48s)]
*  manufactured for one patient at a time. I think when you consider this being sustainable, it's [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1562.92s)]
*  difficult to think about how that is a sustainable process long term. So when we look at the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  allogeneic cell therapy products, I've heard numbers that are extremely exciting that one [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1575.4s)]
*  donor patient could potentially create a batch of cell therapy treatments for over 100 patients [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1583.16s)]
*  or more. So I think this is where the future really is when we look at cell therapy and gene [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1589.4s)]
*  therapy is being able to create higher volumes of products with fewer patient donors needed. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1595.4s)]
*  So I think that's really where the market is headed and really exciting to hear about that. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1603.48s)]
*  When we attend conferences and other events, hearing what the technology and the pipeline is [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1608.52s)]
*  and the excitement surrounding that is definitely very, very encouraging as we think about the future [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1613.56s)]
*  for these products. I think not only will that science evolve kind of into that allogeneic space [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1620.2s)]
*  and the gene therapy space, we'll also see, I think in the pipeline, we're thinking we will see a lot [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1626.76s)]
*  more innovation and manufacturing as well. Are there any advances in the field recently [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1632.36s)]
*  that you've looked at and thought that it looks really exciting? I think the big advances that I [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1638.9199999999998s)]
*  am seeing in the field again kind of go back to what I just mentioned in the technology type, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1644.9199999999998s)]
*  but then also I think the manufacturing of these products is an area where standardization is being [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1650.76s)]
*  kind of evaluated. How do we create more standardized processes to manufacture higher [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1659.24s)]
*  volumes of these products in a shorter period of time? So I think that will continue to be [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1665.6399999999999s)]
*  something where we see advances moving very quickly. Many of the conferences that I have [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1670.84s)]
*  attended recently are focused on standardization of manufacturing and creating efficiency in the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1675.56s)]
*  manufacturing processes. So I think between that, a combination of new science and technology and [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1682.76s)]
*  the type of product that's being created, autologous to allogeneic, seeing more allogeneic, larger [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1689.4s)]
*  volumes being capable with that. And then for the gene therapy products creating, I don't want to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1695.8799999999999s)]
*  say easier ways to manipulate the genome, but some of the technology that has been talked about [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1701.96s)]
*  recently really does feel like it could be extremely applicable to many, many therapeutic [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1710.36s)]
*  areas and could expand very broadly just based on the way that the technology actually works. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1718.6s)]
*  So I think the science, the technology, and the manufacturing is where we're really going to [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1725.08s)]
*  continue to see very quick advancements in development as we look to the future with [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1729.1599999999999s)]
*  cell and gene therapy products. I guess one other thing I would say would be the payment models. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1734.76s)]
*  So one of the things that we hear a lot about with these products are about the cost. The cost of a [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1741.08s)]
*  typical cell or gene therapy product, I think the average is around $1 million currently, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1746.6s)]
*  but the range is very broad. So an autologous cell therapy might cost anywhere from, you know, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1753.24s)]
*  $400,000 to $600,000 plus or minus, and a gene therapy could cost anywhere from $1 million up [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1759.56s)]
*  to $3.5 million. And keep in mind, this is for one dose for one patient. And I think that fact alone [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1767.1599999999999s)]
*  creates challenges in this space. And this is where a lot of these innovations will occur [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1773.8799999999999s)]
*  in payment models and also in the availability of pharmacoeconomic models that show the value of these [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1779.72s)]
*  products very clearly, not only today, but over time. So I think that's an area where a lot of [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1787.64s)]
*  quick action will probably happen over the next couple of years. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1793.48s)]
*  – You mentioned how important events are to what you do, and I know that you [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1796.92s)]
*  attended Advanced Therapies Week recently. I wonder if you could kind of give me a quick [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1802.1200000000001s)]
*  recap or your impressions of the event and whether there are any notable presentations or advances? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1807.0s)]
*  – Yeah, Advanced Therapies Week was a really great conference. It was my first time attending [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1813.64s)]
*  this year a few weeks ago. You know, the messaging of the event is that this Advanced Therapy Week [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1818.28s)]
*  conference is to help biotechs progress on their commercialization journey and pushing the industry [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1824.6s)]
*  one step closer to delivering life-changing treatments to patients, which I saw that on [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1830.2s)]
*  their website. And I said, yep, that pretty much sums it up. That's a great way to say it. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1834.52s)]
*  It was held in Miami, Florida. There were a couple thousand attendees, and there were some [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1838.6s)]
*  great educational sessions and a really good number of exhibitors there as well. Some of the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1842.9199999999998s)]
*  key takeaways, in my opinion, were, number one, I think the need for standardization was very clear, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1849.1599999999999s)]
*  not only in the talk tracks that were included in the presentation sessions, but even in the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1856.76s)]
*  discussions and networking sessions and in some of the meetings that I had, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1864.2s)]
*  we really talked a lot throughout the week about the need for standardization versus that custom [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1868.68s)]
*  approach, one patient for one manufacturer for one drug at a time, really standardizing the process [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1874.68s)]
*  so that there's more scalability, and not only scalability in the manufacturer, but also on the [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1882.3600000000001s)]
*  provider and the patient experience side. So really a lot of discussion about how do we make [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1889.4s)]
*  this process scalable for healthcare providers? Many of the manufacturers have limited their [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1896.1200000000001s)]
*  provider networks to a specific network. So that may include 10 hospitals, it may include 500, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1903.24s)]
*  but there's a very specific network of providers that have access to administer this product to [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1912.6000000000001s)]
*  a patient. So really creating standardization and scalability within that process and making these [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1919.24s)]
*  products more accessible to patients locally. So there was a lot of discussion about that. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1925.32s)]
*  And then the second thing, I think, if I had to kind of group themes would be the value and access [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1930.6s)]
*  theme. So really, again, going back to thinking about how these products could potentially cost [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1936.6s)]
*  $3 million in one day versus, you know, for a hemophilia patient, for example, those costs are [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1942.76s)]
*  spread across a lifetime. And really, how do we clearly show the value of a product that although [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1949.8799999999999s)]
*  it might cost millions of dollars on one day, it reduces total cost of care long term and it [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1958.36s)]
*  drastically improves that patient's quality of life and even duration of life and other factors that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1965.4s)]
*  are not quantifiable in dollars. So I think that was a big source of discussion as well. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1971.4s)]
*  There were talk tracks developed to address these topics, which were very interesting. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1977.16s)]
*  One of the stats that I heard that was very sad was that only two out of 10 eligible US patients [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1982.6000000000001s)]
*  actually receive a CAR T cell therapy, even if they have a need for it and their indication matches [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1989.72s)]
*  that product's indication. So, you know, I think the goal for all of us is to make that number 10 [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=1996.52s)]
*  out of 10 eligible patients receive the therapy that they need. So I heard a lot about how do we [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2003.8799999999999s)]
*  make that happen as an industry working together to get these products to patients. So those were [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2009.72s)]
*  kind of the key themes. Are there any other trends that you think we may be able to look forward to [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2016.2s)]
*  in 2024, putting the pressure on you to have a crystal ball or anything? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2022.2s)]
*  Yes, I do think that 2024 will fly by just like every year does. We were predicting what was [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2026.92s)]
*  going to happen in 2023 just yesterday, it seemed. Things change very quickly, yet they change slowly. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2033.24s)]
*  So some of these things would be the same things probably that I said last year, but still extremely [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2039.48s)]
*  important and we're going to keep on talking about them until we figure them out and we do see [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2045.72s)]
*  progress in figuring some of these things out. So I think number one would be the continued push on [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2049.8s)]
*  efficiency, manufacturing improvements, and making sure that we get the technology to a place where [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2056.28s)]
*  it's scalable. That will result in my number two, which would be the lowering of prices. So right [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2063.2400000000002s)]
*  now I'm addressing trends in cell and gene therapy. I'll talk about biosimilars in one second. So [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2069.7200000000003s)]
*  number two is lowering prices. So again, that efficiency and scalability will result in lowered [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2074.12s)]
*  prices. I think that absolutely has to happen in this space. Then the third thing would be, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2080.68s)]
*  we talked about value and access, creating much more clear pharmacoeconomic messages that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2086.04s)]
*  demonstrate the value, the financial and the clinical value of these products, long-term and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2093.7999999999997s)]
*  short-term. And then the last thing that I think is probably the most exciting thing is the richness [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2098.52s)]
*  of the pipeline in cell and gene therapy. So I think we'll keep on seeing really amazing [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2103.88s)]
*  innovations come into the pipeline. We're monitoring that pipeline very closely. We monitor [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2109.08s)]
*  the pipeline from preclinical all the way through phase three and approval. So we can kind of see [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2114.28s)]
*  that science as it comes into the pipeline. And I think we'll continue to see a really, really rich [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2119.8s)]
*  pipeline in cell and gene therapies and more indications being added to treat more common [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2125.1600000000003s)]
*  conditions. Right now we see that pipeline being more and more prevalent in conditions that affect [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2130.92s)]
*  many people like cardiovascular. We see some neurology indications, even blindness and [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2137.88s)]
*  deafness types of indications. So really exciting things coming in the pipeline. So I think we'll [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2145.0s)]
*  continue to see that. And then for biosimilars, what I think we will see in 2024 is kind of a [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2150.04s)]
*  continued push on some of the political challenges that we see in the biosimilar space. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2155.88s)]
*  Some of the pricing challenges that we see with formulary placements and interchangeability, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2160.6s)]
*  I think we'll continue to hear those as kind of buzzwords. How do we make this industry more [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2167.16s)]
*  efficient as well so that we can really optimize those savings? I think we'll continue to see a [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2172.52s)]
*  political environment. And again, the pipeline for biosimilars is extremely rich. We're seeing [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8h-PlskD0&t=2177.24s)]
