*  We're only a couple of days away from the biggest biopharma partnering conference of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=16.4s)]
*  the year, the Bio International Convention. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=20.04s)]
*  As part of the Biotech's coverage of this year's event in Boston, we'll have a special [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=23.56s)]
*  episode of Beyond Biotech next week with interviews and insights live from the floor at Bio. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=27.8s)]
*  It's sure to be a great episode and you'll find it in your regular podcast feed on Friday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=33.6s)]
*  This week though, we're bringing you a conversation with entrepreneur and biotech blogger Alex [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=39.2s)]
*  Telford. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=44.32s)]
*  Alex is the co-founder of ConvokeBio, a company that helps biotechs and pharmaceutical companies [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  organize information to make better drug development and commercialization decisions faster. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=51.24s)]
*  He's also the author of one of the most intriguing and thought provoking articles of the last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=57.4s)]
*  year titled simply, Some Questions About Biotech That I Find Interesting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=61.4s)]
*  I hope you enjoy my conversation with Alex as we dive into some of those questions, including [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=67.52s)]
*  a couple that might just be unanswerable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=72.16s)]
*  So Alex, welcome to Beyond Biotech. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=77.72s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=81.44s)]
*  Alex, I want to start by letting you share a little bit about your journey into biotech. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=82.44s)]
*  What really sparked this interest in biology and medicine and in technology? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=87.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=93.84s)]
*  I tried to think back on what sparked the interest and I couldn't really think of a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=94.84s)]
*  specific inciting incident. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=98.6s)]
*  I think I'm just a generally curious person. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=100.72s)]
*  I like knowing how things work. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=102.64s)]
*  I had a great biology teacher in high school that probably shifted me a bit towards biology [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=104.6s)]
*  than I might otherwise have done. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=109.84s)]
*  If I had a great physics teacher, maybe I'd be doing physics. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=112.08s)]
*  But I think biology is an infinitely deep and complex space. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  And if you just like learning, there's lots of opportunities there to learn about bizarre [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  organisms and rare diseases and things like that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  So I think that's what kept me interested over these years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=127.64s)]
*  Over these years, look, you studied at UCL. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=131.2s)]
*  You've worked in life science consulting as well with Charles River. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Did that sort of shape your experience in the field? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=138.16s)]
*  Did you draw anything from working in those places and studying there that sort of made [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=141.28s)]
*  you the biotech entrepreneur that you are today? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=145.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=148.88s)]
*  So when I studied at university, I chose to do biochemistry and that was really because [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=150.72s)]
*  I liked chemistry and I liked biology and I didn't want to make a choice between the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=156.0s)]
*  two. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=158.96s)]
*  But I had no real sense of how I could apply the degree to an industry role. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=161.0s)]
*  I had intended to do a PhD, but actually I didn't enjoy lab work as much as I thought [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=167.72s)]
*  I would have done. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=172.52s)]
*  So after doing my undergraduate masters, I was looking for what I could do with my degree [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=173.76s)]
*  in interests that wasn't more science in the lab, more academia. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=179.4s)]
*  And pharma was an obvious application of life science skills and knowledge. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=184.92s)]
*  I didn't really have any idea of what it took to develop medicine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=192.16s)]
*  I didn't really have any specific interest in the operational aspects of developing a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=195.84s)]
*  drug or just what it's like to work in the pharma industry until I started working there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=199.8s)]
*  So really I applied to Charles River, which is a life science consulting or they do broader [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=206.96s)]
*  work, but the division I applied to was a life sciences arm because I just wanted to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  do life science projects. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=216.84s)]
*  But yeah, I had no real sense of what the work would be like or if I would enjoy it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=217.84s)]
*  I just knew that I like life sciences and I worked there for seven years and got to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=223.92s)]
*  work directly with a lot of different pharma and biotech companies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=229.16s)]
*  And really, I think the experience of working in the domain and getting to tackle real world [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=232.64s)]
*  problems, applied problems, see what it takes to turn an idea into a medicine was what deepened [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=239.92s)]
*  my interest in the industry and applied life sciences. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=249.28s)]
*  So yeah, it wasn't like I went in with the intention to do pharma, but really the passion [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=255.28s)]
*  grew from working in the domain for a long time and then seeing just how complex it is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  to make a drug. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=264.76s)]
*  Was there any passion for the business side of the pharma industry as well? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=267.52s)]
*  Not initially, but it definitely developed and it developed relatively quickly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=272.44s)]
*  I think it is one of the most interesting industries. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=276.12s)]
*  Well, obviously, I can't think of one that I personally find more interesting. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  It's the most interesting industry to me. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=284.28s)]
*  But I think it is an extremely deep industry where making a drug is so inordinately complicated. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=286.12s)]
*  It's actually amazing that any drugs get made at all. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=293.32s)]
*  You have to think about it's this incredible multi-parameter optimization problem to bring [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  a drug to market. It takes up to 10 years, 15 years. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=302.2s)]
*  You have to think about can you manufacture the drug? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  How do we design a clinical trial to show the efficacy? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  What patient populations do we select? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=312.56s)]
*  How is the competitive landscape moving along? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=314.68s)]
*  How do we reimburse this drug? Who's going to pay for it? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=318.08s)]
*  So all these questions are just individually incredibly complex and deep and you need to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=321.96s)]
*  pull them all together to actually make a decision about whether or not to develop a drug. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=327.12s)]
*  So I think just the complexity of the industry and it's almost like fractal depth is what [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  got me interested. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=339.68s)]
*  And I think from a business perspective, the dynamics of the industry are also very interesting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=340.68s)]
*  It's venture capital like where a very small number of drugs will generate the vast majority [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=347.0s)]
*  of industry returns. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=354.04s)]
*  So that really influences how people make decisions and invest in new opportunities. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  It's really like winner takes all almost in some therapy areas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=361.0s)]
*  So just that like portfolio strategy and management aspect was something that started to interest [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=366.2s)]
*  me as I spent more time in that space. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=371.48s)]
*  Today, of course, you're at Convoque. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=375.32s)]
*  What sort of led you to move from consulting into actually starting and founding or co-founding [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=377.6s)]
*  your own business? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=383.28s)]
*  Well, really just the experience working with the companies directly and seeing just the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=386.36s)]
*  complexity of the knowledge work that's required to make decisions about drug development. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=392.48s)]
*  So if you're informing clinical trial design or you're deciding whether or not to license [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  an asset or acquire a company or go from stage phase one to phase two or phase two to phase [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=403.88s)]
*  three, just the decisions require you to pull together so many different sources of information. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=409.56s)]
*  It just felt inordinately complicated to collect all these different pieces of information [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=415.6s)]
*  from literature, from industry databases, internal discussions, then synthesize it across [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=421.72s)]
*  all the teams and make sure you have buy-in across the organization. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=428.36s)]
*  And just the knowledge work burden is really, it was immense. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=433.72s)]
*  And it felt like at least in the consulting perspective and seeing some of the process [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=437.2s)]
*  of the companies were doing all this work and then a lot of it got thrown away. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=444.16s)]
*  So it was very one-off. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=448.48s)]
*  And it felt like there could be an opportunity to do this in a more efficient way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=450.6s)]
*  So for a long time, I was interested in how can we productize parts of this knowledge [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  work or how can we define software, make software definable, process that would be repeatable [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  that could save people time and make drug development more efficient ultimately. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=468.88s)]
*  But there was never really a strong path to doing that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=473.28s)]
*  And I got pretty excited around GPT-3 and when some of these language models came out, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=477.28s)]
*  because really for the first time, software was able to take on fuzzy tasks that were [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=483.76s)]
*  previously just the domain of human experts. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's when I got excited about like GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  It was when I got excited about the potential for language models to actually make [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  make software that really works for a broad set of use case in the industry. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=503.44s)]
*  And I think before, you know, the regulatory process enforced a lot of consistency in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=508.4s)]
*  processes across companies and everyone thinks about things in a roughly similar way and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=514.0s)]
*  evaluates opportunities in a roughly similar way. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=518.88s)]
*  But they all have their own nuances and what therapy area they're going after or what internal [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=521.04s)]
*  templates, how their decision, their go-no-go decision process looks, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=526.0s)]
*  which countries they're launching in. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=530.16s)]
*  But it meant that you couldn't really build a software to account for all the edge cases. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  But now with language models, there was that potential, I think, so that got me excited. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=537.04s)]
*  You've mentioned a couple of things that are all in a row. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=542.64s)]
*  The GPT-3, GPT-4, AI, drug development, commercialization, software as well. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=544.96s)]
*  Maybe we should just take a step back. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=551.84s)]
*  For people who haven't heard too much about Convoque, can you explain what you do [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=553.2s)]
*  and what sort of problem you're actually setting out to solve when it comes to drug [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=558.24s)]
*  development and commercialization? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=561.84s)]
*  Yeah, so we're building effectively autonomous knowledge workers for the biofarm industry. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=564.96s)]
*  So the theory we have in the thesis behind the company is that the way knowledge work is done [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=571.04s)]
*  will fundamentally shift. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=575.92s)]
*  Then people are going to need new workspaces to manage and delegate work to AI. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  So there's a whole strata of knowledge work that involves just collecting information, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=582.72s)]
*  putting it together, synthesizing it into templates, then feed up to decision makers [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=587.84s)]
*  or regulators. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=591.68s)]
*  And think of all the work that goes into investigators brochure, for instance. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=593.28s)]
*  That touches medical teams, that touches CROs, clean ops, scientific teams need input in there. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=596.64s)]
*  And so the burden to go and pull that work together is necessary, but it's millions or [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=606.32s)]
*  billions of hours of knowledge work. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=612.4s)]
*  And we think there's now an opportunity to unlock an immense amount of latent capacity [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  in the industry by freeing up that labor-intensive burdens of knowledge work that, frankly, no one [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=619.6s)]
*  really enjoys reading, pulling out information from papers and summarizing derivative documents [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  and filling in regulatory templates. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=631.6s)]
*  So yeah, we're solving really information friction broadly. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=634.64s)]
*  So how people find and integrate information, internal and external to their organization, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=638.56s)]
*  how they use it to create deliverables. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=642.8s)]
*  So I gave the example of an IBE, but we're also excited about use case and competitive [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=644.88s)]
*  intelligence to helping companies pull together up to date, automatically updated competitive [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=650.2399999999999s)]
*  landscapes and some of the medical affairs applications. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=654.8s)]
*  So creating scientific platform, derivative documents from scientific platforms and things [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  like that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=664.88s)]
*  But really the ambition is pretty broad. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=665.76s)]
*  Sounds like you're streamlining, but this is also going to accelerate the drug development [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  as well. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  It's going to save some time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  We hope so. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=676.4s)]
*  I mean, there's a mass amount of time is wasted in white space between trials. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  When a trial is running, you can only really speed it up with recruitment because you're [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=683.1199999999999s)]
*  bottlenecked by the underlying biology of the disease. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=688.4799999999999s)]
*  And if you've designed your trial appropriately, then maybe you can show effect sooner. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=690.4799999999999s)]
*  But there's not so much there, I think, for AI to do. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=694.0s)]
*  But in between the trials, when you're planning, when you're digesting the results of the trial [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=698.24s)]
*  and planning your next trial and deciding whether or not to go forward, that can be [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=701.76s)]
*  a substantial fraction of the total development time, 30, 40% in some cases. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  And if you can speed it up and you can go quickly from one trial to the next, then you [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  can accelerate development. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=716.32s)]
*  So you can pull it down from maybe 12 years to eight years. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=717.36s)]
*  And every single day of delay is, I think the latest numbers are off a million dollars [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=721.6s)]
*  in extra spend. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=727.6s)]
*  So if you can pull one day forward, then that's half a million dollars. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  And if you can pull four years forward, I'm not going to do the math, but that's [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=733.84s)]
*  substantial savings. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=737.2s)]
*  Yeah, so I think acceleration, we're excited about time saving of the individual. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  People doing the work, we're excited about what could they do if they're not spending [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=746.16s)]
*  their time copy pasting things from documents. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=749.44s)]
*  And then we're, I think, also just excited about AI as a tool for knowledge discovery. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  So there's lots of stuff locked up inside companies, inside the literature that is [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  interesting and could be used to generate a new therapeutic hypothesis, or could be [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  used to improve an argument you make to a regulator or when you're talking to, like [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=770.24s)]
*  in a former discussion with a physician that your MSL might have. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=775.84s)]
*  And I think if you can give everyone in your company the knowledge of your most [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=779.36s)]
*  knowledgeable domain expert in a particular domain, then you can really empower every [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=787.2s)]
*  individual worker to come to the best ideas, the best answers, find new hypotheses for [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=792.48s)]
*  drugs, for clinical trial designs. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=802.32s)]
*  So it's really like enabling a self-learning pharmaceutical company to achieve all the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  information. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  At half a million a day, your value prop is obvious. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, as long as we can do it, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=820.4000000000001s)]
*  I think everyone agrees that this is why there's so much excitement about AI in the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  industry, right? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=829.04s)]
*  Because it's obvious that the potential is there to streamline this laborious knowledge [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  work. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  And obviously, the technology is still new. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=838.8s)]
*  It's still very early. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=841.8399999999999s)]
*  So we're going to see the impact play out over many years. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=842.8s)]
*  But working in AI now, it's very palpable how fast it's moving and how much impact [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=846.8s)]
*  it's going to have on some of these use cases. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  Alex, I wanted to have you on because I came across a blog post of yours from April in [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=859.04s)]
*  2024. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  We're linking to that in the show notes here. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  It was titled Some Questions About Biotech That I Find Interesting. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=867.5999999999999s)]
*  And it was on your personal site there. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  Can you tell me what inspired you to write that piece and actually put these questions [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=874.24s)]
*  out there? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=878.16s)]
*  Yeah, so unfortunately, I don't write as much as I would like to these days because [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=880.16s)]
*  Convo keeps me pretty busy. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=885.36s)]
*  But when I was writing regularly, so when I left my last role at Charles River, I took [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=886.64s)]
*  some time to do idea exploration and I took a lot of time out to do writing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=894.16s)]
*  So the way my writing process works is I just like to read a lot about what's happening [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=898.96s)]
*  in areas that interest me, which is often biotech industry. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=907.76s)]
*  And I'll just keep a note of topics that I think could be good future blog posts. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=912.48s)]
*  So really, it's a read a lot, be exposed to interesting ideas in your field, talk to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=920.88s)]
*  interesting people that surfaces interesting topics. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  And then I keep a list down. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=928.64s)]
*  And then over time, I would add to that list. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=930.24s)]
*  And if I felt like I had enough narrative or a thesis for one of those topics that I'd [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  accumulated, then I would say, OK, now I'm going to sit down and actually going to write [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=937.76s)]
*  the blog post out. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=940.72s)]
*  And then writing a blog post is helpful for me to think about an area and deepen my understanding. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  And if other people enjoy it, that's a nice secondary benefit as well. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  But the way that questions post came about was I had accumulated this long list of topics [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=953.44s)]
*  and they've been sitting there for a while. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=958.96s)]
*  And I felt like I wasn't making much progress on them. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=961.28s)]
*  At least I wasn't developing a thesis or an understanding where there wasn't enough data [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=964.64s)]
*  that I could go ahead and write an essay. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=969.84s)]
*  So I said, well, maybe actually what I should just do is put these questions out on a post. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  And maybe they're interesting to other people as well. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=978.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=981.44s)]
*  But some other people who put out questions post, like Patrick Colison has one. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=981.84s)]
*  I think Alexey Gusey has one. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=986.4000000000001s)]
*  So some of these online personalities have these interesting questions posts. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  So I thought maybe I'll do the same thing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=994.08s)]
*  I'll just put out these questions, add a couple of bullet points of my [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=995.12s)]
*  thoughts or commentary about them. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=998.64s)]
*  And who knows, maybe someone will like, who's still about this topic will reach out to me and [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1000.0s)]
*  send me some interesting papers that I hadn't known about. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1006.7199999999999s)]
*  And then I could go ahead and write an essay. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  So that was the motivating thrust behind that particular post. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1011.1199999999999s)]
*  And does the act of actually writing it down, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1017.92s)]
*  it has some sort of way of making things clearer or forcing you to think about things [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  in a more structured way? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1025.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1026.88s)]
*  I mean, this is why I'm not so concerned about AI replacing blog writers or whatever. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1028.08s)]
*  People will say, oh, you can just ask ChatGBT to write you a blog post. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1037.28s)]
*  And then that means that blog writing is obsolete. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1040.96s)]
*  But actually, no, for me, the function of writing a blog is for me to do, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1043.52s)]
*  like by constructing my own argument, I get a deeper understanding of the topic. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1048.96s)]
*  And when you write something down, you have to, it has to be logically coherent. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1053.2s)]
*  It has to make sense to you. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1060.24s)]
*  And the process of creating an essay then is like the function. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1063.8400000000001s)]
*  That's how I explored certain topic and how I develop an opinion on it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1069.68s)]
*  So I don't think AI is ever going to replace that function. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1074.24s)]
*  So yeah, for me, it's just a very important way of getting to an understanding. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1078.72s)]
*  And I do that at work as well a lot. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1084.08s)]
*  So if I want to think about a new feature we're building or what should we do in our strategy, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1085.52s)]
*  then the way that I will explore that is by writing on a post. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1092.96s)]
*  Because everything becomes, or your fuzzy logic and bad reasoning becomes much clearer [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1097.44s)]
*  when you try to articulate it in a way that people understand. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1103.2s)]
*  And then like I said, I never started blogging to get popular on the internet. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  I started blogging because I had a list of questions that were interesting to me in the industry. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1110.9599999999998s)]
*  And I wanted to, the writing is a medium through which I understand those questions. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1115.12s)]
*  I mean, these questions are, they span a very broad, broad swathe of what we see in the industry. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1122.7199999999998s)]
*  It's everything from drug discovery, bioengineering, some revenue elements that we have. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1129.04s)]
*  There's some regulatory elements and even just some fundamental questions like [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1135.0400000000002s)]
*  are pathogens the reasons that we age? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1141.76s)]
*  You know, just really fundamental ideas about disease. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1143.68s)]
*  Are these all just things you've come across when you've taken that curiosity and you're just reading? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1146.64s)]
*  Or are they things that you really want to take a deeper dive into with your company now? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1152.0s)]
*  I mean, some I will probably, some are more close to what we're doing at Convoge. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1158.0s)]
*  So, you know, I may take a deeper dive into those or my opinions may develop. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1161.36s)]
*  Others are just generally interesting. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1166.9599999999998s)]
*  Like I'm not doing anything on longevity, but really it's just, you know, the genesis of that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1168.56s)]
*  list was just a long notes document I have with dozens, maybe even a hundred different questions. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1173.76s)]
*  They're the most interesting ones. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1182.7199999999998s)]
*  But it's really like someone might mention something to me in conversation. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1185.52s)]
*  I think, oh, that's interesting. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1188.3999999999999s)]
*  I put it out in the notes doc or I might read a paper or come across something on Twitter and [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1189.52s)]
*  then put it in the notes doc. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  And I have no intention of really pursuing it further, but I think that it's interesting. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1196.48s)]
*  So that's really, I mean, that's it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1202.56s)]
*  I don't necessarily, just because I'm on the list doesn't mean that I have any intention to pursue [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1205.52s)]
*  it further and some I don't expect to do anything on, but maybe there's value in putting it out [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1209.12s)]
*  there and saying like, hey, this is interesting. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1213.44s)]
*  Because I think like one of the things I've learned is that if you work more in a domain, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1215.6s)]
*  it doesn't take you that long to get up to the frontier of where the interesting questions are. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1221.12s)]
*  And actually like a bottleneck for progress, I think, is figuring out what questions are even [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1225.84s)]
*  worth asking in a domain. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1233.1999999999998s)]
*  So if someone who's, you know, maybe coming from a different background, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1235.1999999999998s)]
*  reason those questions and inspires them to dig a bit deeper, then, you know, that's a great, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  that's a great outcome. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1247.68s)]
*  I do want to dive into a couple of the questions there on your list, or at least the bigger themes [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1249.68s)]
*  that you have there and one to start with is AI and its role in drug discovery there. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1254.16s)]
*  You know, you've talked about the capacity for AI to just help speed up drug development, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  to accelerate it there, to streamline a little bit. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1264.96s)]
*  But what does that mean for the industry, do you think more broadly? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1267.76s)]
*  If drugs get to market a little bit faster, there's more money to be made, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1271.52s)]
*  but there's got to be some implications beyond the business. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1275.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we all hope that eventually it impacts patients and human health and improves [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1280.9599999999998s)]
*  health outcomes, right? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1286.08s)]
*  So that's what everyone in the industry is working for. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1286.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think AI is such a broad topic, right? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1290.56s)]
*  Like we've convoked, we focus on the applications and language models, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1292.3999999999999s)]
*  but there's still a lot to be done in more traditional machine learning and AI. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1295.92s)]
*  You know, just generally like artificial intelligence systems are mechanisms to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1303.12s)]
*  make predictions from data. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1311.2s)]
*  And a lot of what, you know, there's a lot of ways that make better making predictions [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1313.12s)]
*  can improve outcomes in the industry. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  So what's the holy grail, I suppose, is can you improve the ability to predict [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1321.12s)]
*  probability of success for a clinical trial? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1328.4799999999998s)]
*  Well, that's a very difficult question because, you know, probability of success is a course [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1330.9599999999998s)]
*  matter. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1335.84s)]
*  This downstream of so many factors like your trial design, the biology of the disease, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1336.08s)]
*  what molecule you have, modality. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1339.76s)]
*  So I think we're a long way from that, but, you know, still there's many subdomains that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  feed into probability of success that will be impactful. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1350.24s)]
*  So like one is like, I could just talk about a few companies that I've come across, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1352.88s)]
*  I think are interesting. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1356.96s)]
*  You know, one company is making their own models to predict, better predict liver toxicity. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1358.4s)]
*  So using machine learning to train a model on images of cells as you wash over drugs [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1367.92s)]
*  over those cells. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1376.32s)]
*  So that has potential because hepatotoxicity is one of the biggest reasons for drug failure [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1377.92s)]
*  for molecules and especially late stage hepatotoxicity is really damaging because [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1387.28s)]
*  it's hard to, if you don't see a signal in phase one or phase two, then it can just show [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1392.1599999999999s)]
*  up in phase three and larger sample of patients and completely torpedo a drug development [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1396.1599999999999s)]
*  program. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1399.28s)]
*  So that's more traditional application of ML, where we're building a predictive model [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1400.32s)]
*  based on imaging data, it's not a language model. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  And that can be, that has a massive potential impact if we can eliminate hepatotoxicity [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1407.04s)]
*  as a reason for late stage clinical failures. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  And then you have, you know, new surrogate endpoints. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1414.32s)]
*  So if you can predict based on patient biomarkers or based on, you know, radiology, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1416.96s)]
*  imaging, can you develop new endpoints that help you predict where cancer drug is working [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1422.8s)]
*  earlier in development, say phase two, before you have to run the expensive confirmatory [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1429.68s)]
*  OS study. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1435.28s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of applications like that where you're just trying to train a model [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1436.56s)]
*  to help de-risk the next stage of development. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1440.72s)]
*  So you can either make more informed decisions about what you, what drugs do you take forward [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  in the later stages of development, or you can even potentially remove some of those [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1450.48s)]
*  regulatory burdens like, you know, having to run two confirmatory phase three trials, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1456.56s)]
*  that those regulatory, that those requirements are in there for a very good reason. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1462.16s)]
*  And the reason is ultimately that we don't understand biology well enough. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1467.44s)]
*  So I think AI has a great potential to help us understand biology much more deeply than [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1470.88s)]
*  we did before, or at least like develop models that can understand biology for us, and then [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1478.16s)]
*  we can apply those models. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1482.16s)]
*  So yeah, I think the, I mean, this is like what Demis has always said at DeepMind, that's [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1484.0s)]
*  their goal is to use AI as a tool to better understand biology. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1488.0s)]
*  So that's like one set of applications I'm pretty excited about. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1494.32s)]
*  And I think just generally there's industry trends that mean that it's a good time for [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1498.0s)]
*  language models and more of these tools that are focused on increasing efficiency of the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1504.56s)]
*  industry to come along. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1511.84s)]
*  Like, you know, there's pressure, there's industries under significant cost pressure. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1513.76s)]
*  So biotech doesn't necessarily do well in a high rates, high interest rate environment. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1517.12s)]
*  So, you know, the cost of capital for biotech is pretty high at the moment. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1523.6s)]
*  And that means that it's challenging to justify investments compared to when we're in a zero [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1529.1999999999998s)]
*  interest rate environment. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1535.1999999999998s)]
*  So now biotechs need to run much leaner. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1536.2399999999998s)]
*  And AI is, or language models, you know, the promise is that as the anthropic founder said, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1538.7199999999998s)]
*  every person can have access to a country of geniuses and data center. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1547.12s)]
*  So if you can scale out your team with compute, with access to these new language model tools, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1551.4399999999998s)]
*  rather than, you know, having to hire a bunch of people, then that's like one way that you [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1557.84s)]
*  could build very efficient capital, efficient small biotechs. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1564.32s)]
*  So we could have, you know, tiny teams taking drugs all the way to market, rather than having [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1567.9199999999998s)]
*  to rely on an acquisition by a big pharma. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1572.9599999999998s)]
*  So that's kind of, that's one area that excites me. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1577.12s)]
*  I guess one of the other things, though, is the other side of AI then, as we automate more [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1581.1999999999998s)]
*  things, we rely on machine learning. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1585.9199999999998s)]
*  I go back to one of your other questions, which is where drug hunting falls on this [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1587.84s)]
*  luck skill continuum. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1591.6s)]
*  Is there a danger we're going to miss out on something serendipitous by relying on AI? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1593.76s)]
*  I think it depends how you design the systems. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1600.32s)]
*  Like, I think that there are, well, I think first of all, we don't know what the future [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1602.0s)]
*  of work is going to look like, because language models are getting so cheap and so capable [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1606.48s)]
*  that you can just do things that you could never do before. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1613.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's now not infeasible. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1615.92s)]
*  I mean, we've done the math on this to get a language model to read every single paper [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1617.6s)]
*  that's been published on PubMed. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1624.08s)]
*  So you cannot get humans, you can't ask a human team to do that. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1625.76s)]
*  That's completely unreasonable. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1628.48s)]
*  So I think there's, if we apply the language models in the right way, we can just churn [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1630.56s)]
*  through so much more information than we ever could manually. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1635.04s)]
*  And I think if you can do that, then it's an industrial revolution for knowledge work, right? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1639.12s)]
*  You can do things that you cannot, you had no capacity before. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1643.28s)]
*  You can read every paper, you can read every single [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1648.0s)]
*  things ever been published on a given target in seconds. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1653.2s)]
*  You can integrate information for every single piece of information your company has gathered, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1657.28s)]
*  integrate that in a single place and ask questions about it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  So I don't think we know what it looks like when everyone has access to that, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1666.4s)]
*  just like level of intelligence. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so the constraints become pretty different than they are today. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1675.0400000000002s)]
*  You're constrained by really good data, you're constrained by questions. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1682.8000000000002s)]
*  Which questions should you ask? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1688.48s)]
*  You're constrained by good ideas. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1689.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1693.3600000000001s)]
*  I guess one of the other areas that you touched on in some of your questions, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1695.44s)]
*  they had to do with regulation and regulatory challenges. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1698.72s)]
*  You've discussed in our quote, you hear the dance between timely progress [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1702.96s)]
*  and restrictive regulation in biotech. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1706.48s)]
*  Why is this tension just such a critical question for the industry? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1709.2s)]
*  Well, the regulatory, the amount of work you need to do that's imposed by the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  regulators is really defines how much work it takes and cost and time it takes to get [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1722.72s)]
*  a drug to market. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1731.2s)]
*  So if you could just, if we're back in the days of Pat medicines and you could just [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1732.72s)]
*  set up a storefront and sell whatever you wanted, then the cost to develop a drug would [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1738.4s)]
*  be pretty negligible and just be the raw materials. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1743.28s)]
*  But for good reason, we've imposed a bunch of regulatory processes to ensure that drugs [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1745.9199999999998s)]
*  are manufactured to a high quality so that we don't have poisonings and contaminations [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1752.32s)]
*  that we used to have. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1757.52s)]
*  We also impose a level of efficacy and safety data generation so we can properly evaluate [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1759.84s)]
*  the risk benefit of a drug. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1769.12s)]
*  And these are necessary constraints to put on the industry because our understanding [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1770.32s)]
*  of the underlying biology is poor enough that we can't make predictions from first [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1777.76s)]
*  principle about whether or not a drug is going to work. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1783.2s)]
*  Like we cannot engineer drugs in the way we can engineer a bridge or a software program. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1784.64s)]
*  We cannot define the specifications and then pre-engineer that drugs are more discovered [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1791.1200000000001s)]
*  than they are designed at the moment. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1796.0s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, that's why it's critical, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1798.4s)]
*  Because if you have more regulation, it costs more to develop drugs. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1800.72s)]
*  If you have less regulation, it costs less to develop drugs. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1804.5600000000002s)]
*  And getting the balance right is extremely difficult because the correct answer is not [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1807.52s)]
*  zero regulation. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1811.0400000000002s)]
*  Then you'll just have a bunch of unscrupulous actors getting things to market and profiteering [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1812.88s)]
*  and taking advantage of patients who don't have any good options. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1820.0800000000002s)]
*  And it can't be too much. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1824.64s)]
*  No one's going to develop any drugs. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1825.6s)]
*  Gene therapy is a great example where we had a period of time where there was a lot of [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1829.76s)]
*  exuberance for gene therapy and a lot of programs, a lot of funding, a lot of stocks that got [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1834.7199999999998s)]
*  boosted to really high valuations off the back of the scientific excitement. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1844.3999999999999s)]
*  And now we're in a period of retrenchment where it looks like some of the science that [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1848.8s)]
*  there's difficulty from some scientific perspective. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1855.52s)]
*  So delivery remains an issue. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1858.96s)]
*  And also commercially, we've had some of the hemophilia gene therapies not do as well as [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1860.72s)]
*  what was hoped. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1867.2s)]
*  So I think that gene therapy, if we are to realize the benefits of that treatment modality, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1868.72s)]
*  we probably do need a new regulatory regime. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1877.76s)]
*  Because if you look at most of the monogenetic diseases, the population of patients [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1880.48s)]
*  is too small, given the willingness to pay to make it cost effective to develop drugs [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1885.68s)]
*  on the current regulatory regime. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1890.0s)]
*  So yeah, I think we need regulatory flexibility. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1891.68s)]
*  So we're appropriately matching the opportunity, the need, and the difficulty of developing [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1894.56s)]
*  a drug. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1904.6399999999999s)]
*  So we're not just constraining, we're not preventing drugs from getting developed for [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1905.12s)]
*  certain diseases. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1910.48s)]
*  I guess it changes who does the innovation as well. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1912.16s)]
*  The lower the regulatory barriers, it's a little bit easier, like you say, to develop [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1914.96s)]
*  something and to develop a safe drug. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1920.08s)]
*  Whereas if those regulatory barriers are very high, you're going to need an awful lot of [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1923.1200000000001s)]
*  capital just to keep up, just to get going. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1926.96s)]
*  Is it a little bit better for innovation if we just relax those regulatory barriers a [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1930.56s)]
*  little bit or maybe just for rare disease? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1936.16s)]
*  Well, you're always making a trade-off between innovation and safety. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1940.16s)]
*  And obviously, the best for innovation is zero regulatory burdens. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1944.48s)]
*  If you had no constraints on what gets developed, then everyone could just make any drug they [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  could come up with, and I could do it in my basement if I wanted to. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1955.8400000000001s)]
*  I could order some plasmid and then just grow up some bacteria and then make some recombinant [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1959.2s)]
*  protein, just inject it into someone without any constraints. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1966.72s)]
*  Then yeah, you're going to have a lot of innovation, but you're also, that's not going [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1969.3600000000001s)]
*  to be safe, right? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1972.4s)]
*  So I don't think that's the right balance. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1973.04s)]
*  So that's the tension really is how much as a society, what trade-off do we want to accept [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1975.92s)]
*  between innovation and safety? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1986.32s)]
*  And over time, it seems to be the case that societies become more risk-averse. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1988.96s)]
*  Life gets more comfortable. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1995.6s)]
*  You have more to lose in some ways. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1996.56s)]
*  So regulatory requirements have in general tended to ratchet up over time. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=1998.8s)]
*  That's not always true. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2004.72s)]
*  There have been some relaxation, so they like the accelerated approval pathway. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2005.4399999999998s)]
*  But human nature is really, like societal expectations is the bound, and maybe even [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2010.24s)]
*  like the legal system. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2015.9199999999998s)]
*  No one wants to get sued for making a drug that has a side effect. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2017.4399999999998s)]
*  And the FDA or the other regulators is a system that allows, we've agreed on as a society, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2023.6s)]
*  is a reasonable burden to place on industry in exchange for, if the FDA approves something, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2034.1599999999999s)]
*  then you can't necessarily like, well, you can in many cases, but it does sort of take [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2040.0s)]
*  some liability away from the drug developers. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2047.1999999999998s)]
*  And that can make it worthwhile to have a regulatory system in place. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2050.56s)]
*  Indeed, that was one of your questions in there, I think, was, is the FDA actually good [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2055.76s)]
*  for industry? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2059.6800000000003s)]
*  And it sounds like there's certainly a role for it to play in your view. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2060.48s)]
*  No, I think the FDA is good for industry. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2065.84s)]
*  I think the correct amount of regulation is not zero. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2067.52s)]
*  I think you do want an independent opinionated regulator who can hold people in the industry [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2070.56s)]
*  to account. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2078.4s)]
*  I think it's important that you're injecting, the industry makes products that people inject [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2078.88s)]
*  into their bodies to hopefully cure or prevent or treat disease. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2083.76s)]
*  And that needs to be, the public needs to trust what the industry makes. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  And the regulators, a well-equipped regulator is an effective way to help maintain public trust, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2096.2400000000002s)]
*  assuming the regulator is operating effectively. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2107.04s)]
*  So yeah, I think that that's an important function of the FDA, is this helping create [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2112.64s)]
*  public trust, helping hold bad actors in the industry to account. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2118.88s)]
*  You don't want someone selling a patent medicine out of a truck to damage the reputation of the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2123.12s)]
*  entire industry. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2128.0s)]
*  And I do think there is, things wouldn't necessarily happen, like randomized control [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2129.68s)]
*  trials wouldn't necessarily happen without the regulator in position. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2135.28s)]
*  And it's very hard to know if something works without a randomized control trial, because we [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2140.5600000000004s)]
*  don't have these models that can predict when a drug is going to work or not. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2144.7200000000003s)]
*  And we don't have the translational models aren't, in many cases, are not very good at predicting [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2148.7200000000003s)]
*  how a drug is going to work in humans. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2159.6000000000004s)]
*  We do still need randomized control trials to actually figure out if a drug benefits patients [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2161.52s)]
*  or not. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2165.6800000000003s)]
*  And the regulator is a useful way to impose scientific standards on the evidence that gets [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2166.96s)]
*  created and make sure that people aren't spinning those results in a way that is misleading. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2172.88s)]
*  So yeah, I'm pro regulators, but I think that, as I've said in another post, I think the [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2179.36s)]
*  burden needs to be matched to the unmet need and needs to be matched to, there needs to be some [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2185.12s)]
*  consideration of innovation, right? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2190.16s)]
*  Like gene therapy is a tough space. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2192.24s)]
*  If we impose extremely high burdens on gene therapies, the industry may never develop [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2197.3599999999997s)]
*  fully, up to its promise. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2204.16s)]
*  So I think there just needs to be, the regulator needs to be flexible, needs to partner with [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2206.08s)]
*  industry. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2209.52s)]
*  Yeah, and not just completely try to shut it down. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2212.3999999999996s)]
*  In your post there, you had some 27 different questions there, and covering all different [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2215.6800000000003s)]
*  parts of the industry. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2222.6400000000003s)]
*  Is there one on that list that you think might just be unanswerable, that we might never get [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2224.2400000000002s)]
*  the full explanation to? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2229.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think the one that is maybe the most interesting to me is, and potentially unanswerable, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2233.1200000000003s)]
*  is what is the false negative rate of preclinical testing? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2240.4s)]
*  A lot of people talk about the false positive rate, like a drug that works in mice, and then [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2246.8s)]
*  you take it into humans and it doesn't work. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2252.4s)]
*  And there's a lot of jokes about, oh, this drug works, we've cured mice, but we can't [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2254.8s)]
*  cure humans. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2262.08s)]
*  But I think the other way around is also very interesting. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2263.6s)]
*  But I think that if you have drugs that work in mice that don't work in humans, it implies [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2266.4s)]
*  to me that there are drugs that work in humans that don't work in mice. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2270.0s)]
*  So how many drugs are we missing because of that? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2274.56s)]
*  Dogs respond very differently in some cases to certain drugs that humans do, mice respond [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2279.92s)]
*  very differently, non-human primates also respond quite differently in some cases. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2284.24s)]
*  So do we have some fantastic drugs sitting on the shelves? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2290.32s)]
*  Do we have cures that have a great mechanistic rationale for why they would work, and then we [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2294.8s)]
*  put them into a mouse and the mouse had some side effects? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2298.96s)]
*  If only we could have figured out that if we take this drug into humans, then we would [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2302.0s)]
*  have been able to cure the disease, but now we'll never know because it got stopped at [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2306.96s)]
*  the first hurdle. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2310.8s)]
*  But yeah, it's practically unanswerable today because we're not just going to give all these [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  drugs to humans without testing them properly. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2318.16s)]
*  I think we only get to answer it if we do develop more of these models that can [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2321.44s)]
*  learn from human data to predict how they might respond or maybe some of the models [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2327.44s)]
*  like for specific prediction tasks like hepatotoxicity that I talked about earlier. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2334.16s)]
*  This could even move us into something like a digital twin that we could run these sorts [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2340.16s)]
*  of tests on rather than using humans. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2344.64s)]
*  We could take the advantage of whatever we learn from the mouse, knowing it doesn't [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2347.52s)]
*  work, but throw it into a digital twin of a human and maybe we can find something that [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2353.84s)]
*  we would have otherwise missed. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2358.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's the dream, right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2361.2000000000003s)]
*  The FDA said they want to move away from animal testing and I think we should aim to move away [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2364.88s)]
*  from animal testing because we should not be, in the ideal world, we would not be killing [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2369.04s)]
*  millions of mice and dogs and non-human primates. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2374.1600000000003s)]
*  We could just test everything in silico. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2378.32s)]
*  We're not at the point yet where we can quite do that and actually the regulators, I think [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2380.16s)]
*  the regulators' willingness to accept some of this data without animal experiments is [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2386.0s)]
*  higher than perhaps the sponsors where if you don't do a mouse study and you don't do [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2393.2s)]
*  an NHP study, it's pretty hard to justify the capital expense for a phase one or phase [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2398.4s)]
*  two trial. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2403.92s)]
*  I think there's a few different ways we can try and eliminate animal testing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2405.04s)]
*  One is through these better predictive models, models that predict specific safety outcomes, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2408.8s)]
*  toxicity models, maybe digital twins. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2417.04s)]
*  I think we're a way away from that, but we would like to see. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2420.72s)]
*  Obviously, that's something that we'd like to get to eventually, but also just making [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2425.28s)]
*  clinical development cheaper. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2428.8s)]
*  If we can get into humans quicker, but still in a way that's safe, then [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2430.8s)]
*  decision makers at pharma companies may be willing to forgo certain animal experiments, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2438.64s)]
*  then test in humans. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2442.32s)]
*  One of the reasons why we asked about, you talked about why is AI such an imperative [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2444.48s)]
*  right now for the industry. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2450.48s)]
*  One other reason is that China is becoming very good at developing, at least discovering [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2452.24s)]
*  drugs, where they've moved to the value chain from being raw API manufacturers to [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2456.56s)]
*  discovering their own drugs. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2462.0s)]
*  It's not just fast followers, it's genuinely innovative stuff. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2463.84s)]
*  I think that China can, they're a lot cheaper than Western scientists, frankly, and they [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2468.4s)]
*  can get into humans much more quickly than we can under the Western regulatory regime [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2476.16s)]
*  through the investigator-initiated trials. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2481.6s)]
*  That's a challenge for the competitiveness of Western biotechs, where you have an ecosystem [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2486.08s)]
*  that you can get into. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2490.32s)]
*  You can test in humans very quickly, and your labor force is maybe 20% or 30% of the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2491.68s)]
*  cost of the Western labor force. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2497.92s)]
*  I think we do need to find ways to make the industry more efficient. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2502.16s)]
*  And AI is one piece of that answer. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  I think rational regulatory relaxation is another part of the answer. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2506.48s)]
*  Another is just culture and different ways of working. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2511.84s)]
*  I think figuring out how can we be scrappier and how can we use some of these new tools [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2514.88s)]
*  to be hyper efficient and take advantage of some of the infrastructure that's put in place [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  with new CROs and some of these new AI tools and regulatory pathways where available. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2528.96s)]
*  Alex, these were questions that you put out in 2024. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2536.0s)]
*  Since then, has there been another question or maybe a couple of questions that have come [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2540.16s)]
*  to mind that you think, look, that's something else that I'm really curious about? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2543.44s)]
*  Well, there are always questions. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2548.0s)]
*  One thing that I'm interested in now, and there'll be a piece coming out soonish, I [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  think, is on the history of monoclonal antibodies. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2556.7200000000003s)]
*  So monoclonal is a very interesting drug class because it took from the first monoclonal, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2559.84s)]
*  which was a mouse monoclonal that was approved called orthoclonal, it took another 10 years [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2568.08s)]
*  or so for the second one to be approved, for tuxenab. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2572.7200000000003s)]
*  So I think monoclonal is a very interesting case study where you've seen a technology [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2576.32s)]
*  develop and it took 20 years to go from the first approval to monoclonals representing [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2582.56s)]
*  a large fraction of approvals. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2588.4s)]
*  And now about half, I think, of the top 10 drugs are in by revenue or monoclonal antibodies, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2589.6s)]
*  the top selling drug, ketruta, is a monoclonal antibody. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2595.1200000000003s)]
*  So this drug class has now become potentially more important. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2599.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this is quite true yet, but it's definitely challenging small [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2604.72s)]
*  molecules as one of the most important drug modalities. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2608.56s)]
*  And we're seeing the costs of antibody manufacturing continue to decline. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2613.12s)]
*  And it may be the case that with further improvements in manufacturing, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2619.4399999999996s)]
*  we could actually think about making monoclonal antibodies such scale that we can treat [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2625.9199999999996s)]
*  infectious diseases in the developing world. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2631.9199999999996s)]
*  So one to three dollars per gram or something in manufacturing costs is where we might want [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2634.72s)]
*  to get down to to treat some of these conditions. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2638.9599999999996s)]
*  So I think it's an interesting case study of how a technology develops from early stage [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2641.6s)]
*  difficulty manufacturer, no set process, a lot of problems with immunogenicity. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2648.08s)]
*  And then you slowly over time, we've optimized antibody humanization, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2655.2s)]
*  we've optimized antibody manufacturing. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2658.7999999999997s)]
*  I usually manufacture mice. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2661.52s)]
*  Now it's manufactured often in in in CHO cells. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2663.84s)]
*  Now we're getting AI to design antibodies for us instead of having to go through this [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2668.48s)]
*  expensive screening process and clonal selection. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  So yes, I think it's just a great case study to be aware of. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2679.52s)]
*  This technology has gone from nothing to now a potentially [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2684.1600000000003s)]
*  of global importance, similar to small molecules. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2689.2s)]
*  And what's going to be the next technology that will kind of reach that level of importance? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2692.7999999999997s)]
*  And maybe it's gene therapy, but we're probably if history is a guide, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2699.44s)]
*  it's probably 15 or 20 years until it reaches that same kind of level of mass adoption [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2703.2799999999997s)]
*  and potential that monoclonals have reached. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2709.12s)]
*  Alex, for people for people listening who want to dive a little bit deeper into biotech, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2712.3199999999997s)]
*  follow your journey, read what you're writing and learn more about Convoq as well. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2717.8399999999997s)]
*  Where can they find you? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HMDE3j-iH8&t=2722.3199999999997s)]
