Video Description: US-based biotech company Priovant Therapeutics is dedicated to developing novel therapies for autoimmune diseases with high morbidity and few available treatment options. 


The company's lead asset, brepocitinib, is a dual selective inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1. Through dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibition, brepocitinib suppresses key cytokines linked to autoimmunity—including type I IFN, type II IFN, IL6, IL12, and IL23—with a single, targeted therapy. 


Brepocitinib has generated positive data in seven phase 2 studies with oral once-daily administration. It is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 program for dermatomyositis and is entering a phase 3 program for non-infectious uveitis.


This week on the podcast we have a conversation with Priovant’s CEO Benjamin Zimmer about dermatomyositis, non-infectious uveitis, current treatments, potential options, and how brepocitinib is making a difference.

# Priovant - finding options to treat autoimmune diseases
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 101. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. There are certainly quite a lot of autoimmune diseases and there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=16.92s)]
*  are many companies that have dedicated themselves to finding new treatment options. Some diseases [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=23.56s)]
*  have very few options currently and this week on the podcast we're talking about two of them in a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=29.8s)]
*  conversation with Priovance CEO Benjamin Zimmer. The diseases are domatomyositis and non-infectious [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  uveitis and we talk not only about those diseases but also current treatments, potential options [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=43.52s)]
*  and how Priovance prepositinib is making a difference. So I guess the first question is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=50.8s)]
*  if you could give me a bit of background on the company. We were established in 2021, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=57.4s)]
*  so relatively recent company with a vision really of developing new treatments for rare [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  autoimmune disease. I think pharmaceutical innovation and autoimmune disease has focused [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=71.36s)]
*  a lot on finding the next drug for the same set of large market indications psoriasis, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=77.32s)]
*  rheumatoid arthritis diseases like that and we're certainly not the only company focused [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=85.4s)]
*  on more rare diseases but I would say we're part of a cohort of companies that's at the vanguard [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=90.92s)]
*  of that and excited to be that. The company was set up as a partnership between Royvance Sciences [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=96.08s)]
*  which is a group of biotechs you may be familiar with and Pfizer and as part of that Pfizer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=104.24s)]
*  contributed to Priovan prepositinib which is our lead asset and had been at the time we were [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=110.84s)]
*  launched and has been now even more very thoroughly evaluated today. The drugs generated positive data [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  and seven completed phase two studies so I think we have kind of a best of both worlds company [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=124.56s)]
*  where we have our corporation is very young and new and we have a lot of energy and passion that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=131.08s)]
*  comes with that but our IP has been you know very extensively developed at ND risk which obviously [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=138.04s)]
*  in biotech is a great luxury and privilege to have so I think a very nice kind of combination there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=145.64s)]
*  Maybe we can talk a little bit before we talk about the treatments and what you're doing with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=153.08s)]
*  your drugs. You're addressing some really serious diseases I wonder if you could tell me a little [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  bit about the actual disease dermatomyositis and what it is how many people have it the prognosis [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=166.96s)]
*  that kind of thing. Yeah absolutely so yeah there's two lead indications we're focused on [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=174.0s)]
*  now one is you know that is dermatomyositis and then the other is an ocular disease called [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  non-infectious uveitis. Endermatomyositis where we have a phase three trial a private that will be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=188.0s)]
*  reading out next year. This is a very severe disease of inflammation primarily of the skin [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=196.96s)]
*  and muscle though there's a large number of comorbidities that can affect other organ systems [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=204.0s)]
*  particularly the lungs as well but a quite debilitating disease and it's rare but not ultra [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  rare affects around 35 to 40,000 adults in the United States and as I was saying before quite [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=218.32s)]
*  impactful in terms of the muscle disease you know quite debilitating some patients end up in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=226.32s)]
*  wheelchairs because their muscle weakness is so great around 33 percent of patients with the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  disease require some sort of mobility aid around half of patients report falls which can you know [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=238.64s)]
*  obviously have a large number of serious comorbidities including hospitalization dysphasia [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=246.56s)]
*  where patients have trouble swallowing due to muscle weakness is another big problem so the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=253.12s)]
*  muscle weakness can be very debilitating and then the skin rashes as well these are quite painful [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=258.8s)]
*  in disfiguring rashes that can cover large portions of the body with with scaling irritation a lot of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  pain involved and so a very very debilitating disease the five-year mortality has been estimated [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=274.16s)]
*  different studies have provided different ranges but anywhere from 10 up to in one study they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=284.56s)]
*  estimated 30 to 40 percent and you know that results from some of these comorbidities in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  terms of falls as well as lung disease and cancer which can be comorbidities so you know this is a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=295.68s)]
*  very serious disease very high unmet need when you think about it it's you know not biologically [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=303.2s)]
*  but in terms of patient impact sort of cancer like and in terms of just how desperate the patients [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=309.76s)]
*  are for new treatments and then non-infectious uveitis the other lead indication we're pursuing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=316.4s)]
*  we recently generated some promising phase two data and we'll be entering phase three later this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=325.2s)]
*  year that affects a few more people actually any kind of non-infectious uveitis affects several [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=331.2s)]
*  hundred thousand people in the u.s but where we're really focuses on non-interior uveitis which means [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=338.0s)]
*  uveitis that affects something beyond just the front of the eye because that the inflammation [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  when it's just in the front of the eye can sometimes be treated with eye drops and so is [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  a little less burdensome but when you have it in the intermediate or back areas of the eye [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=356.64s)]
*  you generally require some sort of systemic treatment and it's a you know very debilitating [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=363.52s)]
*  disease even the non-interior manifestations of the disease affect around 70,000 adults in the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=370.24s)]
*  u.s so again rare but not some ultra rare disease etc uveitis is the fourth leading cause of blindness [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=378.16s)]
*  among working-age population in the developed world you know very debilitating very burdensome [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=385.92s)]
*  disease and i think this is the sort of area where we're excited to be working [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=392.8s)]
*  sure what what are the current treatments for both of those conditions so for dermatomyositis [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=398.16s)]
*  there's really almost almost nothing available the only approved drugs for the indication are [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=404.0s)]
*  steroids and different steroidal treatments and then intravenous immunoglobulin which is a [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=411.04s)]
*  sort of transplant of immunoglobulin into patients very burdensome procedure requires infusions [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  there are several hours per day several days per week one week per month so you know quite [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=427.04s)]
*  burdensome in infusion regimen and also although definitely can help a number of patients is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=434.64s)]
*  associated with often a lot of serious side effects so you see patients being treated with that and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  then also just a lot of patients on on high dose steroids and your kind of general immunosuppressants [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=447.52s)]
*  in rheumatology like methotrexate and mycophenolate isoprim which are actually not formally approved [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=454.96s)]
*  for dermatomyositis but are often used given the absence of good treatments available [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=461.44s)]
*  in non-infectious uveitis humira is approved and obviously a very successful a successful drug [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=468.96s)]
*  overall its efficacy in uveitis is more limited i wouldn't say it's one of the disease areas where [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=476.88s)]
*  humira has the best benefits but it is available to patients as a modern targeted therapy based on [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=484.32s)]
*  the data we saw in our phase two study you know it suggests a potential product profile that could be [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=492.88s)]
*  more beneficial to patients than what we've seen from humira but obviously comparing a phase two [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=500.64s)]
*  study to an approved drug should be done with all due qualifications and so that's our studying it [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=505.84s)]
*  further to confirm that what is um preposytenib and how does it work so preposytenib is a first [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=513.36s)]
*  of all it's a once daily oral treatment so i think you know that that alone i think is something that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=522.32s)]
*  is you know very differentiating and promising to patients in these diseases where both among [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=529.28s)]
*  the approved drugs and even among the other drugs under investigation there's a very limited oral [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=536.48s)]
*  options the drugs are dual inhibitor of tick two and jack one it acts on the jack stat pathway which [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=543.76s)]
*  is a pathway involved in the transduction of different inflammatory cytokines so the inflammatory [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=552.32s)]
*  cytokines are you know involved in immune cell signaling and the transduction is kind of how [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=560.08s)]
*  the messages from a cytokine actually gets kind of communicated to the nucleus of the cell to then [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=566.32s)]
*  affect a change in the immune cells behavior and there's four different isoforms of these [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  jack enzymes jack one jack two jack three and then you might think jack four but instead tick two is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=582.48s)]
*  the fourth one and the way the transduction works is different combinations of two different pairwise [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=590.56s)]
*  combinations of isoforms are involved in the signal transduction of different cytokines so acting on [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  the jack stat pathway can be a quite potent way for a molecule to still be a targeted molecule [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=606.16s)]
*  but actually affect multiple inflammatory cytokines so there actually are a number of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=614.88s)]
*  drugs that act on this pathway they're already approved zeljanz is one of them actually a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=622.8s)]
*  Pfizer drug renvoke is another one so tick two is a more recent approval and there's a number of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=630.96s)]
*  others as well but none of them are dual selective inhibitors of jack one and tick two specifically [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=638.0s)]
*  and that gives us that particular selectivity for those two isoforms gives us a uniquely powerful [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=646.72s)]
*  and in our view a kind of set of cytokines that we in turn suppress so through jack one we're able [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=656.0s)]
*  to suppress interferon gamma interleukin six a number of other cytokines linked to autoimmunity [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=664.08s)]
*  and then through tick two we're able to suppress IL-12 and 23 and really to kind of get all of those [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=672.64s)]
*  at once you kind of need this particular selectivity to these two isoforms and then [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  actually type one interferon which is very involved in dermatomyositis both jack one and tick two are [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=687.5200000000001s)]
*  involved in the signaling of that so we're able to get particularly potent suppression of that and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=693.92s)]
*  so the mechanism really aligns well in that sense with these diseases we're focused on because one [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=700.7199999999999s)]
*  of the reasons these diseases are so burdensome on patients is that they're highly inflammatory [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=707.92s)]
*  with multiple pathogenic cytokines multiple inflammatory axes and so our hypothesis which [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=713.8399999999999s)]
*  the data we have so far has certainly supported is that this mechanism is really optimally suited [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=722.48s)]
*  for these diseases so we can kind of create this perfect storm of very high unmet need not a lot of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=730.48s)]
*  drugs approved not a lot of drugs or oral drugs in development and then a mechanism that's really [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=738.48s)]
*  particularly optimized for these highly inflammatory indications you mentioned that [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=746.16s)]
*  there's not a lot of treatments out there are there other different kinds of treatments [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  being developed anywhere to tackle these diseases yes certainly i think you know [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=758.64s)]
*  dermatomyositis it's interesting when we started kind of in around 2021 working on this um you know [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=764.88s)]
*  i would have said the answer is there's not that much and we were i think kind of at the vanguard [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=773.84s)]
*  of that since that time there's actually been a tremendous amount of research interest in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=778.96s)]
*  dermatomyositis and myositis more generally both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have antibodies that are [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  in or or approaching phase three studies the fcrn's which you know are a mechanism that have [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=794.24s)]
*  been used in certain other autoimmune diseases Argenics and Johnson and Johnson both have [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=802.4s)]
*  those that are in sort of mid-stage studies right now and then a number of kind of earlier stage [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=810.0s)]
*  proof of concept studies that have been initiated so i think you know i think it's a sign that a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=817.28s)]
*  lot of pharma companies are starting to appreciate what we did which is that this is a really [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=823.52s)]
*  significant unmet need and a promising opportunity for a drug i think prepacitinib is [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=829.28s)]
*  distinguished from these in a number of ways as i mentioned before it's a oral therapy which none [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=837.68s)]
*  of the other drugs in late stage development are i also think you know we're probably kind of first [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=845.12s)]
*  in the pack in terms of timeline to potential approval with our phase three study reading out [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=852.16s)]
*  next year i think a lot of the other studies are either kind of in the earlier stages of enrolling [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=859.52s)]
*  their phase threes or have more phase two proof of concept data coming out sooner and as i said [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=864.88s)]
*  before i think our mechanism is very well suited to dermatomyositis given you know it is a highly [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=873.36s)]
*  inflammatory indication with with multiple pathogenic cytokines so for instance both the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  Pfizer and astrazeneca drugs target type 1 interferon which is very important in dermatomyositis [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=888.48s)]
*  but they don't touch type 2 interferon which is also important and prepacitinib for the reasons [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=896.0s)]
*  as mentioning before is able to suppress both of those cytokines so i think if anything it's kind [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=902.64s)]
*  of exciting and promising that a lot of other pharma companies have turned their attention [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=910.56s)]
*  here i think it's validating that the market opportunity and unmet need is real i think it's [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=915.76s)]
*  you know obviously great for patients to you know have as many options as they can and as much [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  research going into the space as possible but i think we're well very well positioned to be [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=928.88s)]
*  one of the leading treatments here and you already mentioned Pfizer i wonder if you could tell me a [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=934.4s)]
*  bit about the partnership with them yeah so you know so obviously they have a different drug in [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=939.28s)]
*  development for dermatomyositis as i mentioned that that's not related to our partnership i think [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=945.12s)]
*  you know as i mentioned kind of in the history of the company you know we were really set up as a [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=951.84s)]
*  partnership between Royvend Sciences and Pfizer and i think that you've seen i think is you know [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=956.96s)]
*  kind of part of Pfizer's R&D strategy and business strategy like a kind of research and development [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  externalization approach where they you know for certain drugs that they're excited about but for [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=971.84s)]
*  various reasons think could be better developed through smaller biotechs will partner to kind [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=978.96s)]
*  of spin those out into new standalone biotech companies that Pfizer is a significant minority [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=986.24s)]
*  owner of but is you know not that involved operationally necessarily like springworks [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=993.76s)]
*  therapeutics which is now a multi-billion dollar publicly traded company and the oncology space is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1000.64s)]
*  a good example of that really vinton pfizer actually had a second similar collaboration [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1008.16s)]
*  called televent as well so as part of that they're a significant minority shareholder of the company [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1015.2s)]
*  have a seat on the board and you know kind of work very closely in giving us a lot of you know [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  strategic guidance which is quite helpful and you know great to kind of be able to pick the brains [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1028.72s)]
*  obviously of that very large human capital filled organization but i think in a nice way too [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1035.68s)]
*  private was really set up to be a fully independent company and Pfizer's shareholder in the same way [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1044.24s)]
*  that a venture fund would be a shareholder you know providing a lot of great strategic guidance [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1050.48s)]
*  but you know we're still able to operate very nimbly and quickly and execution without kind of [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1055.44s)]
*  having to go through hurdles and in collaboration with them there's no joint development committee [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  or anything like that. I wonder if you could move on to your studies in clinical trials now if you [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1068.08s)]
*  could tell me a bit about the Neptune study? Yeah so this was the study in non-infectious uveitis [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1074.4s)]
*  that read out earlier this year so that was a result we were very excited about for a few reasons [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1082.0s)]
*  first of all just a bit about kind of the treatment paradigm in uveitis because this is you know an eye [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1090.56s)]
*  disease can lead to blindness when patients are experiencing symptoms very aggressive treatment [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1096.48s)]
*  for you know obvious reasons so the standard way that physicians treat the disease that they do a [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1103.44s)]
*  oral steroid burst that's very high often 60 milligrams per day if you're familiar with other [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1109.76s)]
*  autoimmune diseases that's extremely high generally you know anything above 20 milligrams per day would [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1117.68s)]
*  be considered very very high that's obviously a steroid burst it's not administered chronically [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1123.76s)]
*  so they do that to get the inflammation under control and then what the physicians are looking [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1131.52s)]
*  for it's like okay how do we get rid of the the steroids and replace them with something more [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1136.08s)]
*  sustainable over time and so generally the model of study in non-infectious uveitis is to do one of [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1141.52s)]
*  these steroid bursts administered concurrently with the investigational drug and then taper the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1149.52s)]
*  steroids and kind of see basically how long you have you know sustained benefit or the endpoint [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1156.48s)]
*  that's generally measured is actually treatment failure so basically how long can you prevent [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1163.44s)]
*  treatment failure and one of the interesting things we did in study design is we did a much [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1167.84s)]
*  more aggressive steroid taper than has been seen in past trials including the humira approval trials [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1173.52s)]
*  so our study involved a two-week burst followed by a six-week taper which is very very quick and [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1181.84s)]
*  past studies the taper had been about 13 weeks after the two-week burst so we actually kind of [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  held our drug to a much higher standard and in spite of that we actually got much lower treatment [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1198.16s)]
*  failure rates from brepacitinib so our treatment failure rates for brepacitinib 45 milligrams seen [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1205.0400000000002s)]
*  and in this study was below 30 at six months we need to run the phase three to confirm it but i [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1213.44s)]
*  think a very promising result that in spite of a more aggressive steroid taper we were able to do [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1220.48s)]
*  a much better job of preventing treatment failure so yeah very excited about that and then we are [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1226.24s)]
*  very very actively working right now to get ready to initiate the phase three study later this year [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1233.44s)]
*  and and be off to the races with that to hopefully get the drug approved as quickly as possible [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1241.2s)]
*  so what are the sort of the next steps and the timeline for the clinical trials for both of the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1248.16s)]
*  diseases in uveitis coming out of the neptune study you know as i mentioned we're kind of full [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1254.56s)]
*  speed ahead into phase three we're currently actively engaging with fda as part of the end [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1262.08s)]
*  of phase two process to align with them and get their input on a registration supportive [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  phase three program i think we should have that you know quite soon and then on the back of that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1275.28s)]
*  our plan is to start dosing patients by the end of the year and i think you know we should have [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1281.36s)]
*  more precise timelines on that once we kind of know the exact final study design coming out of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1287.28s)]
*  the fda engagement though certainly the basic principle is going to be to not change too much [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1293.76s)]
*  from phase two because you know something worked worked well once don't fix what isn't broken [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1298.8799999999999s)]
*  in dramatically a site us we have a study called the valor study this is um actually set out to [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1306.4s)]
*  enroll the largest interventional clinical trial ever conducted in myasitis with this study so it's [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1315.8400000000001s)]
*  designed as a single phase three study to support registration to support approval test two doses of [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1322.64s)]
*  reposite and 15 milligrams and 30 milligrams against placebo the enrollment target was [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1330.0s)]
*  approximately 225 patients which again is significantly larger than has ever been [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1337.2s)]
*  undertaken we actually have been able to enroll that study for rare disease and for a study given [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1344.24s)]
*  its size fairly quickly our kind of total enrollment timeline will be around two years [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1350.8s)]
*  the study is on the verge of being fully enrolled it will be fully enrolled the summer will kind of [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1357.52s)]
*  formally announce that once it's complete and then that's a one-year primary endpoint so that data [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1363.52s)]
*  would be coming out sometime in the second half of of 2025 and you know as i mentioned a significant [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1370.24s)]
*  undertaking around the largest interventional dermatomyositis study ever conducted and it's [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1378.48s)]
*  actually a space where some of the smaller studies have struggled to enroll so i think the fact that [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1386.48s)]
*  ours did it the way it did is a sign of the enthusiasm that the medical community has around [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1391.52s)]
*  our drug so yeah very promising we're very excited about that and that will obviously be you know [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1398.08s)]
*  looking ahead to next year a very major milestone both for for our company and and i think you know [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1402.72s)]
*  for the myasitis research field overall in terms of the readout of that study and again because it's [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1408.88s)]
*  it's such a large study in a rare disease our plan is is following that to most likely assuming [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1416.48s)]
*  assuming the data is very good as we hope and expect it will be to move ahead with a an nda [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1423.68s)]
*  filing and could potentially have the drug on the market not that far after that so i think very [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1430.32s)]
*  very exciting opportunities in both of these diseases and in terms of kind of upcoming [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1437.28s)]
*  milestones and timelines definitely good news has it been a challenge to find the right people [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1444.24s)]
*  for these studies it's interesting in rheumatology and particularly these kind of rarer rheumatologic [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1452.0s)]
*  indications you know what i'm about to describe as part of what i find fun about it but it certainly [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1460.4s)]
*  doesn't make it easy is first of all these are heterogeneous diseases so if you think about [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1465.44s)]
*  something like dermatomyositis there's different organ systems involved you know some patients [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1472.1599999999999s)]
*  might have really bad muscle disease and more modest skin disease other patients might have the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  opposite you know some might have lung involvement others don't have lung involvement so the symptom [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1484.96s)]
*  presentation is very heterogeneous and then the background medications they're on are quite [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1491.04s)]
*  heterogeneous too you know i think in general in rheumatology treatment paradigms are not quite as [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1496.56s)]
*  rigid as an area like oncology where this kind of very formal lines of therapy i think in [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1503.04s)]
*  in rheumatology especially for rare diseases it's kind of a lot more done at the discretion of the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1510.32s)]
*  particular treating physician and that's particularly true for something like dermatomyositis where [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1517.76s)]
*  there can't really be super formal treatment governments because there's so little approved [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1523.92s)]
*  to begin with so i mentioned like the rheumatic immunosuppressants like methotrexate, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  mycophenolate, azathioprim these drugs are used widely in dm but are are not formally approved so [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1536.48s)]
*  different doctors will have different ones that they prefer and kind of use in different ways [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1544.0800000000002s)]
*  there's different regional variants you know ivig as i mentioned before is used very unevenly [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1550.4s)]
*  because it does provide some benefit to patients but the side effects are so great and the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1557.6000000000001s)]
*  infusion regimen is so burning so a lot of patients and physicians don't like it [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1562.8000000000002s)]
*  so you know the patients kind of come into these trials with heterogeneous symptoms and [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1568.5600000000002s)]
*  heterogeneous background medications and so you in designing a trial you need to balance [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1573.44s)]
*  kind of meeting the field where it is but also with the fact that you're trying to run a controlled [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
*  experiment and then running a controlled experiment you want to minimize noise and minimize [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1585.12s)]
*  heterogeneity other than your control variable which is drug versus placebo so it is quite [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1591.12s)]
*  challenging in you know in spite of the fact that there actually are for rare disease a lot of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1600.0s)]
*  patients affected and they do desperately need new treatments i think you know a lot of companies [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1604.88s)]
*  have found it a challenging space to enroll and some have struggled more than others i think you [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  know we've put a lot of effort in as our company to really building relationships with the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1618.72s)]
*  physicians in the space and really partner with them to kind of find a way operationally [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1626.4s)]
*  to really make this work and then again i do think it also speaks again to how promising the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyBCy2dAHI&t=1631.2s)]
