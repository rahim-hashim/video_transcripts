# Ipsen advances liver disease treatment
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 74. I'm Jim Cornell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly LaBioTech podcast and amazingly we're already into December. Last month the American [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  Association for the Study of Liver Diseases liver meeting took place in Boston and creating [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=22.72s)]
*  a bit of a buzz at the event was the late breaking presentation from Ipsen regarding [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=28.94s)]
*  results from the company's clinical trial looking at primary biliary cholangitis or [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=34.9s)]
*  PBC which is a lot easier to say. To tell us about PBC, its treatment and the trial [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=41.1s)]
*  results is Jennifer Schwantz, Ipsen's senior vice president and global head of rare diseases [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=47.22s)]
*  in the company's R&D division. I guess if we could kick things off with giving you a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=54.22s)]
*  little bit of background on your role at Ipsen. Yeah, so I'm Jennifer Schwantz. I'm senior [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=59.5s)]
*  vice president and global head of rare diseases in the R&D division at Ipsen. So my role is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=66.34s)]
*  really to foster and grow rare diseases at Ipsen. So that's through working with my colleagues [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=74.82s)]
*  in external innovation, business development to in-license opportunities as well as in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  responsible for the clinical programs. So that's all clinical oversight, safety, efficacy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=87.42s)]
*  during our clinical development programs and working with regulatory authorities to try [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=92.94s)]
*  to seek approval for all of our medicines in these rare indications. Obviously it's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  a big company and you tackle an awful lot of different conditions and diseases but I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=105.26s)]
*  guess today we're focusing a little bit more on liver disease. Could you, before we talk [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=110.78s)]
*  about treatments, explain what primary biliary cholangitis and cholestatic liver disease are? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=115.42s)]
*  Ipsen is a mid-sized biopharmaceutical company so we have oncology, neuroscience and I'm [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=122.7s)]
*  responsible for rare diseases and within that we have rare liver diseases. And PBC we say [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=128.38s)]
*  for short or primary biliary cholangitis. It's a genetic, chronic, progressive autoimmune liver [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=133.82s)]
*  disease that affects more women than men so it's nine women to one man just based on the autoimmune [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=141.18s)]
*  component and what happens is that you get inflammation and storage of toxins, bile acids [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=147.98s)]
*  in the liver that leads to cholestasis which is accumulation of those toxins which are hepatotoxic [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=155.66s)]
*  and that can lead to inflammation of the liver which then causes a lot of the symptoms, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  fibrosis which is scarring and the end stage of that if untreated is cirrhosis of the liver [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=165.82s)]
*  due to the toxins and that can lead to complications of portal hypertension, esophageal [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=172.06s)]
*  varices and need for a liver transplantation or the worst obviously would be death if you don't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=178.22s)]
*  get a liver transplant. So I think the important thing is that it's a chronic progressive liver [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  disease that many women and men who have this condition may not be diagnosed until they've had [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=189.82s)]
*  it for quite a bit of time because there is a period of time where it's asymptomatic. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=196.22s)]
*  Dr. Greger How rare would the disease be? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=200.22s)]
*  Dr. Cattie It's a rare liver disease but it's more of a common rare liver disease so about two to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=202.54s)]
*  three per hundred thousand people will have it and there is some recent epidemiology that the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=207.74s)]
*  prevalence seems to be increasing so there most likely is a genetic predisposition, it's got an [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=214.14s)]
*  autoimmune component but there seems to be an inciting event that leads to triggering it and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=220.22s)]
*  then you get the buildup of the bile acids and the toxicity in the liver. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=226.54s)]
*  Dr. Greger Because it's a relatively rare disease is it something that's easy to diagnose? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=230.14s)]
*  Dr. Cattie It requires clinicians to ask their patients questions and so a lot of the times it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  can be very vague, fatigue, parietis, muscle aches and pains, joint pain which many people have and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=241.5s)]
*  not have a disease so it's important for people to recognize that these symptoms could be something [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=248.62s)]
*  more serious and it really requires a very simple blood test called an alkaline phosphatase that if [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=254.7s)]
*  that's elevated then the doctor should look for the causes of that and then that is important to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=261.34s)]
*  get a diagnosis because you know we see in rare diseases overall as well as rare liver diseases [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=266.7s)]
*  the time from onset of symptoms, the time of diagnosis and treatment can be delayed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=272.3s)]
*  and that diagnostic delay is the problem because you really want to start treatment as soon as [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=277.18s)]
*  possible to prevent the progression of the liver disease. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  Dr. Greger What are the current treatments for the condition? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=284.3s)]
*  Dr. Cattie The treatment available for a long time is called UDCA [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=287.34s)]
*  and that is a naturally occurring bile acid and first line treatment is using that treatment. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=291.58s)]
*  It's been around as I mentioned for 30 years but 40% of those patients don't respond to therapy so [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=297.9s)]
*  that blood test, the alkaline phosphatase stays elevated and so your liver is continuing getting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=303.5s)]
*  this inflammatory insult. There is a second line treatment available called Ocaliva in the U.S. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=309.18s)]
*  and many other places in Europe and so that's called second line treatment and the response [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  rate to that is only 50% and the other issue with the current second line treatment which then [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=321.1s)]
*  creates the unmet need is that it also worsens paritis and cause patients paritis to get worse [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=327.42s)]
*  so that is problematic. So what's been exciting is that we have a potential new class of drugs [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=333.18s)]
*  that can hopefully help prevent the progression of the liver disease as well as improve some of the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=339.42s)]
*  symptoms. Greger Right, you mentioned that some of the treatments have been around for a long time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=344.3s)]
*  What have the challenges been to innovation in this space? Dr. Cattie No, it's a really good [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=348.94s)]
*  question and many of us who do rare liver diseases and rare liver diseases are really, really [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=354.38s)]
*  passionate about the ability to address unmet need in patients working with clinicians who are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=359.5s)]
*  clearly dedicated to help their patients live a healthier, better life and so some of the challenges [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  is one finding patients and getting them diagnosed appropriately so that diagnostic delay is a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=372.78s)]
*  problem and often there's misdiagnoses as well so that's an area. The innovation requires really [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=378.53999999999996s)]
*  creativity in doing clinical development because often you're paving the path and try to establish [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=385.26s)]
*  what the clinical endpoints could be for getting regulatory approvals as well as often a challenge [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=391.5s)]
*  is really understanding the natural history of the disease so that you can appropriately make sure [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=397.02s)]
*  that what you're studying in your clinical studies is appropriate for approval by the regulatory [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=401.9s)]
*  authorities but also answering questions for the patient so there are challenges of innovation as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=406.46s)]
*  well as it's really important to have the collaboration of the patient organization so we can hear the voice [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  of the patient and what they need and what you know the unmet need is for the disease and also [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=420.38s)]
*  it's really important to collaborate with regulatory authorities as well as payers [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=426.3s)]
*  for reimbursement because without that collaboration of all those groups the drug when approved will [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=431.74s)]
*  not get to the patient so that's really the importance of making sure there's access. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=437.5s)]
*  So could you tell me about Elifrebinor and how it works and how it's administered all those things? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=441.98s)]
*  Elifrebinor is an investigational medicine it's a P par alpha delta so that's actually a hard [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  term to say so the long form is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha delta [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=455.82s)]
*  so now you know why we call it a P par alpha delta coagulants and it's a new class of medicines and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=461.74s)]
*  it's a target for primary biliary cholangitis because it has an important role to play in the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=469.18s)]
*  bile acid metabolism we talked about earlier inflammation as well as hopefully modifying [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=474.46s)]
*  moderating the immune response so as I mentioned it's a new class of treatment [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  there's many challenges one on trying to prevent disease progression and also helping with symptom [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=485.26s)]
*  you know management for patients so we're really excited that there hasn't been a new [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=490.62s)]
*  class for primary biliary cholangitis for you know over 10 years and so we're excited that this is [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=496.06s)]
*  really kind of the next generation for developing treatments for patients. How is the drug given to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  patients? So it's a oral medication so it's a pill which is a boron a tablet form and it's taken [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=508.7s)]
*  once a day. Oh excellent is it something that people take and then stop or are they on it for life? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=515.74s)]
*  I know it's a good question and there is no cure for pbc currently so as I mentioned it's a chronic [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=522.38s)]
*  progressive autoimmune disease so we really important to take this medication chronically [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=528.3s)]
*  and for life and so that's why in all our clinical studies we have long-term safety outcomes to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=534.62s)]
*  continue to follow the safety of the drug while it's in the real world after approval as well [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=542.06s)]
*  as well as having information coming from our long-term clinical outcome studies to guide [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=548.4599999999999s)]
*  physicians on the long-term treatment benefit of the medication. Could you tell me a bit about the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=554.6999999999999s)]
*  ELATIV trial that you have running and the results that you presented at the AASLD liver meeting? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=560.14s)]
*  It was a really exciting meeting and there was a lot of buzz regarding the fact that there's a new [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=567.1s)]
*  class of drugs for this rare liver disease primary biliary cholangitis so ELATIV study it's a [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=572.46s)]
*  registrational phacery study it's a double blind placebo controlled trial that was for 52 weeks [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=578.22s)]
*  and then it has a long-term extension for up to five years so it just shows you how long that you [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=584.46s)]
*  need to study liver diseases so you can look for improvement over the long term and look for long-term [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=589.66s)]
*  safety. The study met its primary endpoint so currently it's a surrogate marker a combination [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=595.66s)]
*  of the blood tests I mentioned one was the alkaline phosphatase and the other one was bilirubin [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=602.06s)]
*  because cholestasis is defined as wanting to achieve an alkaline phosphatase level less than [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=607.26s)]
*  1.67 times the upper limit of normal and greater than 15 reduction from baseline as well as having [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=614.3s)]
*  a total bilirubin which is another blood test under the upper limit of normal so with that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=621.66s)]
*  biochemical composite endpoint we were able to show that 51 percent of patients met it which is [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=626.78s)]
*  highly statistically significant compared to four percent with placebo which means a 47 percent [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=633.5799999999999s)]
*  treatment difference which means if you're on the medication you're 13 times more likely to get a [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=639.98s)]
*  biochemical treatment response and currently the thoughts are that this biochemical treatment [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=646.22s)]
*  response will be a predictor of long-term improvement on the inflammation and the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=651.34s)]
*  preventing the fibrosis and scarring that still has yet to be proven over the long-term studies [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=657.5s)]
*  but this is the current clinical thought so it's really exciting that we met that primary endpoint. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=662.94s)]
*  Yeah absolutely what was the reaction like at the meeting you said it was quite a good meeting. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=668.22s)]
*  It was really exciting so we met the primary endpoint as well we could show that we were [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=673.18s)]
*  able to normalize alkaline phosphatase in 15 percent of patients which is great and you know [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  that's tremendous one because the overall average level of the alkaline phosphatase was quite high [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=682.3s)]
*  it was around 329 so we started from a high level and we were able to bring down the alkaline [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=688.22s)]
*  phosphatase to a low level with the upper limit of normal being 104 so it was a really a high [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=693.66s)]
*  target and we were able to achieve it. What was most exciting at the meeting was Robert who is [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=699.1s)]
*  head of the PVC foundation whose mother has primary ability cholangitis got up to the microphone. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=704.4599999999999s)]
*  When I met Robert for the first time a few years ago he told me his mom's story so she was a [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=711.98s)]
*  highly functioning you know mother corporate executive who got PVC and he saw her literally [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=717.58s)]
*  wither away that she was no longer able to go to work she was having trouble taking care of herself [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=726.22s)]
*  and taking care of him and when he spoke to me about this a few you know years ago he had tears [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=732.38s)]
*  in his eyes just how he described how this disease really affected his mother's health physical [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=737.74s)]
*  emotional psychological and so after the late breaker session Dr Chris Bowles presented the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=742.86s)]
*  data to the congress Robert got up and he said that he was really really proud to being part of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=749.1800000000001s)]
*  the moment where this data was presented and it was obviously shown to be highly efficacious and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=755.34s)]
*  well tolerated and he said it brought him back to hopefully more women will be able to benefit from [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=761.34s)]
*  treatment and not have to go through or suffer like his mother did so it's really a proud moment [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=768.22s)]
*  for us at Ipsen being part of this as well as we always bring it back to our patient centricity and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=773.58s)]
*  our patient focus is that we're really hoping that we can help women and men who have this disease [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=779.4200000000001s)]
*  feel better and hopefully prevent progression of their liver disease. That's something that quite [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=785.1800000000001s)]
*  often gets lost is those human stories that really kind of brings it home a lot. No absolutely and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=790.14s)]
*  I always say until you walk in somebody's shoes you don't know what they're actually experiencing [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=797.26s)]
*  and we're all fortunate health is the most important thing you can have and so when you [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=801.58s)]
*  you know you can help a person with this disease and not only help that person but you're helping [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=807.02s)]
*  the family so you think about many women who are disproportionately and have this disease [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=811.5s)]
*  they also are caregivers they take care of the family their children and they often also have to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=816.7s)]
*  work in the current environment so it really is debilitating for women that have to just keep on [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=822.46s)]
*  pushing on and men who have this disease so hopefully these new drugs will be able to help [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=827.34s)]
*  them feel better and be able to be more productive. Is this something that is leading towards being [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=832.46s)]
*  able to cure PBC or is it just something that allows you to live your life and it's just [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=838.1400000000001s)]
*  something that you manage? It's a great question and currently there is no cure and I think once [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=843.5s)]
*  these new class of agents become available and we can follow long term to see whether we can [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=849.26s)]
*  prolong the health of patients, prolong liver health, avoid the long-term complications [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=854.86s)]
*  as long as the drugs are taken chronically that will be really an important scientific [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=860.38s)]
*  innovation. Of course it's always important and you know in my role at Ipsen we're always looking [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=865.74s)]
*  for the next generation of therapies both in colicetic liver diseases and other liver diseases [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=871.8199999999999s)]
*  so we're always striving to find the best in class or first in class medicines to help treat [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=877.66s)]
*  these diseases. Obviously you're a large company and recently just acquired another company Alborio [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=883.1s)]
*  and how important are acquisitions in terms of developing the company's pipeline? It's really [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=889.3399999999999s)]
*  critical so our whole strategy is through external innovation and partnerships and collaboration so [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=895.18s)]
*  our rare liver franchise really started with the in licensing and having full commercial [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=902.9399999999999s)]
*  manufacturing and development rights to LF-fibonor which is the PPAR alpha delta agonist we've been [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=908.14s)]
*  talking about for colicetic liver diseases primary biliary cholangitis being one also looking at [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=913.9s)]
*  other diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis. Then we acquired Alborio because [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=919.66s)]
*  similarly to being colicetic liver diseases as pediatric colicetic liver diseases so we [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=925.42s)]
*  acquired the company and we have Bilbae which is Otavixabat which is a IBAT inhibitor, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=931.1s)]
*  iliobiolytic transport inhibitor and that is helping with also remove the toxic [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=937.26s)]
*  bile acids from the liver and these are pediatric diseases and also we're finding also in adults. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=942.94s)]
*  Many adults could have some of these diseases that have in the past been undiagnosed so one's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=948.94s)]
*  called PFIC or primary familial intra hepatic colostasis the others and that's approved in many [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=952.86s)]
*  places around the world with Bilbae and then the second indication we got approval in the US [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=959.74s)]
*  this year is for Allergyl syndrome which is a multi-system complex genetic disease and then [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=965.42s)]
*  we have an investigational ongoing study in biliary atresia and this is a disease where [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=971.42s)]
*  babies are born they essentially know bile ducts and the bile is not flowing from the liver so [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=977.1s)]
*  it's really life-threatening if they don't get immediate surgery to bypass the blockage and then [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=982.14s)]
*  we're looking at a clinical outcome study where we're providing Bilbae or Otavixabat to see whether [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=987.58s)]
*  we can improve and keep the native liver so patients at least children babies essentially [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=993.34s)]
*  don't have to go to liver transplant so now that we have a portfolio of pediatric colostatic liver [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=998.86s)]
*  diseases being treated with Bilbae there's also a lot of pipeline medicines that we're also looking [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1004.62s)]
*  at other diseases hepatitis delta as well which is a rare liver disease so there's a lot of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1010.7s)]
*  opportunities for development getting approvals of drugs and looking for new indications which we [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1015.82s)]
*  call life cycle management and then we're always scouring what's available for first in class or [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1021.34s)]
*  best in class medicines to add to our current portfolio for rare liver diseases so it's something [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1027.02s)]
*  that we just continue to go through look for innovative medicines and try to bring them into [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1032.6200000000001s)]
*  our company for development so you're working on a lot of things simultaneously i guess that's it [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1038.14s)]
*  that's why we well that's probably the passion for rare diseases one you have to really want to do [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1043.74s)]
*  rare diseases and it's the gratification is huge because you're really helping patients who are [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1049.1s)]
*  very vulnerable and have really not been managed before because there's been no innovation so [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1054.14s)]
*  that's really critical i'm you know very fortunate that ipson and our board is very supportive of rare [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1058.86s)]
*  diseases in general and rare liver diseases so you know the investment for our development [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1066.06s)]
*  is really critical and certainly knowing that we've been successful and doing development [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1070.22s)]
*  and bringing you know drugs to market in rare diseases is good for us to be able to continue [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1075.0200000000002s)]
*  to look for new partnerships and then also just knowing that the medicines you're doing is really [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1080.14s)]
*  helping patients and their families you know gives us the enthusiasm to continue despite some of the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1085.26s)]
*  challenges that we have with you know disease drug development it is certainly is a challenging [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1090.94s)]
*  environment that requires resilience enthusiasm for sure be able to think out of the box think [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1095.5s)]
*  creatively on how you can you know do the development for these rare diseases and medicines [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1102.54s)]
*  and really the ultimate goal for all of us is just making sure that we get our drugs to patients to [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1107.66s)]
*  help them feel better seems that you're already making a huge impact how much more impact do you [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1112.3s)]
*  think that you can have in the field well now that we want to be established and absent as one or [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1117.98s)]
*  rare disease company and two specifically since we're talking about liver after the exciting [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1124.14s)]
*  aasld meaning is we really wanted to be known as a leader of innovation in rare liver disease so [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1129.42s)]
*  we're in this for the long haul we want to support the community the patient organizations [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1136.0600000000002s)]
*  we really want to continue to build upon our current medicines that we have and assets and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1141.8200000000002s)]
*  development to look at other rare liver conditions so not just colostatic liver so we're always [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1147.26s)]
*  looking for where the unmet need is and where the innovation is if there's you know obviously it has [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1152.3799999999999s)]
*  to be an indication it has to be a neck mechanism scientific plausibility but we will go out there [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1157.58s)]
*  and hunt and you know look for the medicines that will answer that unmet need so i think we're in it [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1164.06s)]
*  for the long haul and that will certainly shows our investment to the liver community i think [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1169.58s)]
*  that's really the message that i wanted to get through and i'm just really excited that we've [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1174.94s)]
*  had very strong partnerships with the patient associations because without a collaboration [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1179.82s)]
*  between the patient associations pharma regulations you know policy and reimbursement we're not going [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1184.9399999999998s)]
*  to be successful so if anything i just want to say it's a collaboration where everybody plays an [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1191.82s)]
*  important role and what are the next steps for development of alafibranou well it's a [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1196.86s)]
*  registrational study so since now we have the data public and i'm really actually honored and excited [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1201.6599999999999s)]
*  to say when the late breaker was being presented by dr bolus we had a simultaneous publication of [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1207.66s)]
*  the new england journal of medicine so we're really thrilled showing that the high level of [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1213.74s)]
*  science and clearly the unmet need captured the attention of the new england journal of medicine [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1218.5400000000002s)]
*  so we're thrilled with that so the next steps is going through what we call the regulatory pathway [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1223.66s)]
*  is to do regulatory submissions and our plan always at ipson is to be as quick as possible and as [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1229.5s)]
*  nimble as possible so simultaneous submissions globally is our plan and then as soon as we can [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1235.42s)]
*  publicly make that announcement that those submissions have been accepted you hopefully [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1241.66s)]
*  will be hearing about that and then it's our job to ensure that we then work with the regulators [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1246.22s)]
*  to get the drug approved and then ensure that once that happens we can work with [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1252.3000000000002s)]
*  pairs and access such that patients have the drug available to them as quickly as possible [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1258.46s)]
*  definitely positive news for those suffering from pbc let's hope the treatment reaches patients [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1268.7800000000002s)]
*  quickly and an even bigger bonus that it's a pill so don't forget to check out the latest news and [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1275.74s)]
*  articles at the biotech.eu and i hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fdpzA4ZR8&t=1282.06s)]
