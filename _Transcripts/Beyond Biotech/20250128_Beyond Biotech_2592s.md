Video Description: Disease X, a concept shrouded in mystery, represents the unknown pathogens that could unleash future epidemics or pandemics. 


In the wake of recent global health crises, our understanding of the profound impact of those pandemics has deepened. 


On this week’s podcast, we have a conversation with Hamilton Bennett, who led Moderna’s mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine development program team to the authorized use and approval of one of the earliest and most effective vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Bennett is Moderna’s senior director of vaccine access and partnerships, and has unparalleled insights into the world of infectious diseases. 

In this in-depth discussion, Bennett talks about the origins of Disease X, the role of mRNA technology in tackling pandemics, and the importance of preparedness.


Disease X was intended to be a placeholder name; it was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 on their shortlist of blueprint priority diseases to represent a hypothetical, unknown pathogen that could cause a future epidemic.

# Beyond Biotech podcast 65 – Disease X and pandemic preparedness
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech Podcast number 65. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the weekly LaBiotech Podcast, and it's the last one in September. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=14.88s)]
*  And it's a good one, I promise. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=20.88s)]
*  I spent a part of last week in Lithuania, and now every ad and pop-up on my phone and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=22.92s)]
*  my computer seems to be about the country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=28.88s)]
*  I was in the capital Vilnius for the Baltic Life Sciences event, and it was a good one. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=32.24s)]
*  I met some great people and the organisers were super helpful. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=37.12s)]
*  I really enjoyed the city too and managed to get a couple of long walks in, and there's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=41.04s)]
*  some wonderful scenery close to the city. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=46.04s)]
*  I kept my streak going of being asked for directions on every trip that I take, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  I was asked twice. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=54.2s)]
*  And both of those times were in Lithuanian. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=55.76s)]
*  Of course I don't speak Lithuanian, so I ended up having to speak Russian in one of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=58.78s)]
*  the markets to ask a question, because I'd heard the person speaking Russian, and I was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  surprised that I remembered so many words. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=68.86s)]
*  Ironically the word for thank you in Lithuanian is acu, and I caught a really bad cold while [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=71.66s)]
*  I was there, which I still seem to have. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=77.94s)]
*  So it seems appropriate that I'm sneezing and saying acu all the time at the moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=80.58s)]
*  Anyway, enough of that, the podcast this week is going live on September the 29th, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=86.18s)]
*  is Coffee Day, and one that's really important, the International Day of Awareness of Food [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=91.64s)]
*  Loss and Waste. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=97.58s)]
*  It's also World Heart Day and Stupid Question Day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=99.5s)]
*  I'm sure I've had my fair share of those, especially being an interviewer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  In science, if you like mysteries, I urge you to check out The Disappearance on September [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=107.54s)]
*  the 29th, 1913, of a certain Rudolf Diesel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=113.42s)]
*  You probably recognise the name because of the diesel engine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=118.7s)]
*  It's a very interesting story and a little long, so I won't bore you with it here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=122.78s)]
*  I'll let you do some discovering on that one. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=128.22s)]
*  September the 29th has two Thomas Edison connections, because it's the day in 1891 he patented [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=131.18s)]
*  a process of and apparatus for generating electricity, and in 1914 a patent for a phonograph [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=138.06s)]
*  record. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=146.82s)]
*  Funny how, once something is invented, you can't ever imagine a time when it didn't exist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=147.82s)]
*  Going back to Rudolf Diesel, my son who has been off school because there's another strike, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=154.06s)]
*  asked me how people got answers to questions before Google existed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=159.38s)]
*  I don't think he was really prepared for the 20 minute answer, and I think I saw him making [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=164.22s)]
*  a note to never ask me anything ever again. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=169.17999999999998s)]
*  It's now time for me to ask some questions and get some great answers because we will [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  head into today's interview, and it's all about pandemic preparedness and disease X, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=177.05999999999997s)]
*  which is completely unrelated to Twitter changing its name to X. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=183.66s)]
*  As always, I will let this week's guest tell you what disease X is and its relevance, and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=187.66s)]
*  that guest is Hamilton Bennett, senior director of vaccine access and partnerships at Moderna. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=193.54s)]
*  She was instrumental in the development of vaccines for COVID-19, and to read out her [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=200.5s)]
*  biography would probably take up the entire podcast, so I'm delighted that she agreed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=206.1s)]
*  to speak with us about her work. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Without actually talking about disease X at this point, I wonder if you could give some [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=214.94s)]
*  background on what you do and a little bit about your previous work because of the connection [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=219.78s)]
*  with COVID-19. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=225.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=226.3s)]
*  Moderna is a pharmaceutical biotechnology company, and we're best known for our work on RNA-based [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=229.82s)]
*  medicines, and that includes messenger RNA or mRNA. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=237.74s)]
*  mRNA is an information molecule that instructs your body to produce a protein, and it's a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=242.98s)]
*  critical intermediary in natural biological processes that keep bodies functioning every [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=249.78s)]
*  day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=255.42s)]
*  What Moderna has done over the last few decades is building on early research that scientists [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=256.42s)]
*  have been doing in the mRNA space for years, is learned how to repurpose that mRNA and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=262.14s)]
*  that biological process to really unlock a whole new world of medicines. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=268.06s)]
*  While the scientists have been doing this for decades, Moderna has been doing this work [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=274.3s)]
*  since 2010, and we've really focused on building a platform that allowed us to design and develop [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=277.82s)]
*  medicines against infectious diseases and rare diseases, immuno-oncology targets, but [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=286.9s)]
*  all using this RNA-based messenger RNA medicine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=292.26s)]
*  The association with COVID-19 is that I think most people right now know Moderna as a COVID-19 [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  vaccine company. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=303.22s)]
*  We started that work based on years of research that we've been doing in infectious disease, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  developing vaccines against bio threats like pandemic influenza and Zika, and over that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  decade of research and investment in the science of mRNA, we were really well positioned to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  not only create a novel vaccine against COVID-19, but also to leverage that understanding to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=323.54s)]
*  do it incredibly quickly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=330.38s)]
*  We've been able to build a platform and then demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=332.38s)]
*  it during COVID-19 quite quickly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=336.74s)]
*  I think a lot of people naturally assume that when COVID happened and all of a sudden there [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=339.22s)]
*  was a vaccine that everybody had kind of started from ground zero, but clearly you'd already [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  done quite a lot of work in the field before this happened. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=351.14000000000004s)]
*  We had, yes, on both fronts, as I mentioned, we've been working against the platform itself, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  sort of understanding mRNA. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  How do you design mRNA so that it is able to be well tolerated by your body? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  It's able to be manufactured, it's stable, it produces the right antigen and really honing in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  the process chemistry of mRNA itself. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=378.42s)]
*  We also did a lot of work in the lipid nanoparticle that helps you deliver the mRNA into the cells [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=381.98s)]
*  without being destroyed by your bodies. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of platform advancements that had been happening over the 10 years that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=390.38s)]
*  we had been in existence. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=394.94s)]
*  But we also spent quite a bit of time looking at infectious diseases and different pathogens [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=396.98s)]
*  of concern. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  I mentioned pandemic flu and Zika before, but really what allowed us to move quickly on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=404.1s)]
*  SARS-CoV-2, that novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019, was that we, in collaboration with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  other researchers at the NIH and others, had done work looking at how would you create an [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=415.5s)]
*  mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-1? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=421.02000000000004s)]
*  How would you create an mRNA vaccine against MERS? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=423.98s)]
*  And really understanding how to design a potent antigen that induced a protective immune response [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=427.38s)]
*  for a beta coronavirus, the cluster of viruses from which SARS-CoV-2 originated. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=435.38s)]
*  So when we got the sequence for SARS-CoV-2, we were able to look back at the database [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=442.38s)]
*  that we had created over the prior years and with confidence move forward and say, we know [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=447.14s)]
*  our platform works. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=452.46s)]
*  We know that we have a solid antigen design and let's now move that into the clinic as [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=453.9s)]
*  quickly as possible. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=458.78s)]
*  And of course, the other aspect to that is the fact that you don't just wait around for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=459.78s)]
*  another virus or another disease to happen before you work on it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=466.14s)]
*  Are there a lot of potential diseases that you're keeping a track on and maybe even ones [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=472.02s)]
*  that we're not necessarily aware of, like for example, animal diseases or even plant [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  diseases that could potentially jump into humans? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=483.18s)]
*  Yes, there's quite a bit of horizon scanning that we do in the infectious disease community. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=486.54s)]
*  So those of us that focus on infectious diseases, communicable diseases, spend quite a bit of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=494.82s)]
*  time looking at potential threats and then trying to find ways to characterize those. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=499.94s)]
*  Because as you alluded to, there are thousands of viruses that can infect humans and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=505.94s)]
*  have over the centuries. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=513.06s)]
*  What we then try and do is prioritize those and rank them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=515.0999999999999s)]
*  What is the threat that they pose to human health? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  What do we know about the pathogen? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=521.4599999999999s)]
*  And one of the best ways that we do this is by binning pathogens into kind of related [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=523.5799999999999s)]
*  groups. And often right now in the what is sometimes called health security or bio [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=530.18s)]
*  preparedness space, we think about viral families. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=534.66s)]
*  And what that means is we look across the numerous viruses that can infect humans. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=538.7s)]
*  And what we see is the largest threat comes from around 10 to 12 of these viral families [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=545.98s)]
*  where there are multiple pathogens within a family that can infect humans. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=551.34s)]
*  And we also see events that are what we call spillover events where a new pathogen that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  is circulating in an animal reservoir may spill over into a human. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  And so we use that sort of clustering to help focus us. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=567.7s)]
*  And it happens that the WHO and others have aligned to this approach years ago and they [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  created the R&D blueprint priority pathogens. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=577.14s)]
*  And what they did is they looked across the threats that are causing outbreaks around [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=581.9000000000001s)]
*  the world and tried to find representative pathogens that the research community could [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=586.86s)]
*  work on in the hopes of also informing related pathogens. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  So as listeners are probably aware, there have been multiple Ebola outbreaks and that's [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=597.6600000000001s)]
*  Ebola Zaire. Recently, there was an outbreak of a novel strain Ebola Sudan. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=602.26s)]
*  There are related viruses of Marlboro. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=608.26s)]
*  So what we do is we do research towards creating tools, creating detection assays, creating [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=611.5s)]
*  surveillance mechanisms, creating animal models that allow us to really understand each of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=617.38s)]
*  these individual pathogens, but also to zoom out and say, well, how do these relate to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=621.7s)]
*  each other and what are we learning about our families? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=626.26s)]
*  So while we are preparing very specifically for outbreak threats like Ebola, like Marburg, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=629.22s)]
*  like Nipah and Zika and Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, we are also looking at what [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=636.7s)]
*  would a related virus look like and how well prepared are we for that? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=643.74s)]
*  And that's where this concept of disease X comes in, as I think it were naturally as [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  humans, we want to kind of simplify the complexity of the world sometimes and we can get [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=653.66s)]
*  very focused on creating the best vaccine against a specific pathogen. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=658.38s)]
*  But what we try and do in the bio preparedness space is to say, how does that help me [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=663.5799999999999s)]
*  prepare for the unknown and what would be the disease X component? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=670.06s)]
*  How ready am I for that novel pathogen that SARS-CoV-2? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=674.78s)]
*  Am I learning things that are going to translate to a related pathogen that help me move [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=678.74s)]
*  faster in the future? And so the disease X concept that was introduced by the WHO is sort of [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=683.58s)]
*  this constant reminder that you need to continue to do that broad horizon scanning for the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=690.5s)]
*  pathogens and the viral families that we know, but also continue to take what is called a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=696.86s)]
*  one health approach where you're looking at the genes that might not yet have infected [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=702.9000000000001s)]
*  humans and cause disease, but that we know are circulating in reservoirs where humans come in [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  contact with them quite often. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=714.26s)]
*  And just continue to do that scanning to take a broad lens before we dive back down and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=715.82s)]
*  deeply focus on individual infectious diseases. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=721.26s)]
*  And how do you stay ahead, I guess, of the existing diseases and probably the most obvious [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=724.62s)]
*  one being the variations and mutations that we've seen with COVID? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=730.1800000000001s)]
*  It is always difficult to stay ahead of a virus. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  I think that that's one of the things that we've learned over the centuries and certainly [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=739.22s)]
*  RNA viruses. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=742.78s)]
*  The best way that we've found to do that is by creating processes that are applicable to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=744.26s)]
*  other pathogens or other variants. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  And that's like really what the value that I see in the mRNA platform and the way that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=754.86s)]
*  Moderna has established ourselves as a platform company with shared processes across our [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=760.5799999999999s)]
*  infectious disease portfolio, because what we really need to do is remove as much [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=768.0999999999999s)]
*  uncertainty as we can to move quickly. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=772.74s)]
*  So if we think about COVID-19, what we've been able to do in the first year was go from [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=775.5s)]
*  sequence identification of the novel coronavirus in January to distributing an authorized [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=782.78s)]
*  vaccine by December of the same year. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=789.54s)]
*  And that's remarkably fast and is really only possible because of the mRNA platform. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=792.66s)]
*  But as you've alluded to, there continued to be the rise of new what we call variants of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=797.38s)]
*  concern, these strains of COVID that were divergent enough where they were beginning to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=802.8199999999999s)]
*  escape the protective immune response that was induced by the original vaccine series. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=809.62s)]
*  So that required that we update the mRNA sequence of the vaccine and release a new [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=815.02s)]
*  modified version that was better matched to the circulating strains, those variants of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=820.78s)]
*  concern. With an mRNA technology and an appropriate regulatory environment where you have [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=825.38s)]
*  a mechanism to have that data reviewed by a health authority quickly, we can update that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=831.42s)]
*  vaccine composition very quickly. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=839.06s)]
*  And it's again, it's really something that's only possible with an mRNA technology, which is [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=841.46s)]
*  why this has been so revolutionary for infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=846.26s)]
*  In 2021, we were able to update the sequence of the COVID vaccine in just around 100 days. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=851.1s)]
*  Or sorry, that was in 2022. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=860.94s)]
*  And in 2023, we've done the same thing. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=862.82s)]
*  So what we've done is said what initially took us 12 months, 11 months, depending on how [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=865.26s)]
*  you count, to get a product to authorization. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=870.46s)]
*  We now have a mechanism and a process in place to update that vaccine if needed within 100 [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=874.22s)]
*  days. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=880.5400000000001s)]
*  There are so many of them out there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=881.46s)]
*  Do you ever get discouraged by the sheer number of them and the mutations that happen like [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=882.9000000000001s)]
*  COVID-19? Do you ever kind of say, well, not another one? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=889.14s)]
*  It's a fascinating space to work in infectious diseases because you're always trying to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=892.62s)]
*  outsmart something that has not to personify infectious diseases too much, but you're [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=897.34s)]
*  trying to outsmart something that has spent its entire existence trying to outsmart you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=902.74s)]
*  And they're much better at it than we are historically. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=908.58s)]
*  I think what we focus on is how do we create systems that allow us to respond to new [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=911.5s)]
*  threats as quickly as possible, whether that's a related threat, you know, it's a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=919.4200000000001s)]
*  modification or a variant of an existing pathogen that we know about or a truly novel [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=924.22s)]
*  introduction of a new pathogen into our health ecosystem. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=930.82s)]
*  And I think within the viral families, we're getting much better at this. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=934.78s)]
*  And I'm actually really encouraged by the way that we talk about this coming out of the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=938.5s)]
*  pandemic. There has been really great alignment among governments to say we need to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=943.74s)]
*  improve our surveillance strategies for infectious diseases. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=950.38s)]
*  We need to improve health success and work towards universal health care has become [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=954.38s)]
*  quite a big topic, recognizing that the strength of the health system influences your [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=961.58s)]
*  ability to respond to an outbreak and prevent the spread of a pandemic. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=967.34s)]
*  We're talking about health equity in access to medicines as well, which are things that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=970.38s)]
*  we're unfortunately not front of mind for the public health community. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=976.6999999999999s)]
*  So I'm really encouraged by that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=982.3399999999999s)]
*  I think there will always be threats, but it's about how do we get better at identifying [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=984.02s)]
*  those threats, working to mitigate them while we're waiting for medical countermeasures [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=990.5799999999999s)]
*  to become available. What are the non-pharmaceutical interventions that we have? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=996.3399999999999s)]
*  And then really being collectively as a public health community laser focused on trying [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1000.46s)]
*  to address that threat wherever it is as quickly as it is. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1006.7s)]
*  I'll say that we're quite fortunate in the viral space because it's much easier for us [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1010.22s)]
*  to characterize protective immune response to a viral target. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  Bacteria are are a little bit more difficult because they're much more complex pathogens. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1020.22s)]
*  And so there it is a slower research endeavor, but those pathogens also mutate a little [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1025.14s)]
*  less quickly than viruses. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1032.74s)]
*  And so there's less diversity and divergence in the bacterial space. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1034.22s)]
*  What you're seeing in bacterial space is the rise of resistance. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1040.18s)]
*  And really now the field is starting to recognize the threat that that antimicrobial [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1045.18s)]
*  resistance poses to public health and thinking about new ways to incentivize markets to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1051.06s)]
*  bring forward novel products. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1058.26s)]
*  So I think there's every time there is a threat that identifies a gap in our public health [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  system, it's quite encouraging to see the way that we as a community are really responding [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1066.22s)]
*  to not only the acute threat that we face, but also putting new processes and systems in [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1073.78s)]
*  place to respond systemically to the inputs that might have either bird that threat in the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1078.54s)]
*  first place or prevented a more timely response. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1085.3799999999999s)]
*  Does that same approach apply to and I know it sounds kind of science fiction, but we know [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1089.1399999999999s)]
*  the reality of the fact that there is biological warfare being developed and being researched [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1095.5s)]
*  all of the time. Does that do would you use the same approach to tackling something that is [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1102.22s)]
*  I don't say artificially created, but artificially manipulated perhaps when you are looking at [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1108.58s)]
*  a threat or kind of a bio threat, the source of the pathogen matters for those of us that are in [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1114.82s)]
*  the response space because we like to make sure that we when we're conducting horizon scanning [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1123.1399999999999s)]
*  and we're doing potential pathogen surveillance that we are surveilling the right environment. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1128.1399999999999s)]
*  So we spend a lot of time thinking about migration of hosts and are they entering new [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1132.8200000000002s)]
*  geographies and so new populations are at risk? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1139.5400000000002s)]
*  Are humans and animals interacting in new ways and new locations that are going to increase [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1142.5800000000002s)]
*  frequency of contact and increase spillover events? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  The vast majority of pathogens that infect humans are coming through that route. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1150.14s)]
*  There is a minority of gain of function research of kind of bio terrorism research, but [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1156.78s)]
*  effectively you're using pathogens that are known to the space and therefore if we're doing our [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1164.22s)]
*  jobs appropriately, the response is also being known. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1170.74s)]
*  So regardless of the source of the pathogen, the response from pharmaceutical perspective would be [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1174.06s)]
*  the same. Certainly been a bit of interest in avian flu. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1181.6599999999999s)]
*  I wonder if you could say anything about that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1185.18s)]
*  One of the reasons that we were able to respond quickly to COVID-19 and then bring forward the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1187.54s)]
*  vaccines to address the variants of concern so quickly is that there was a regulatory process in [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1192.94s)]
*  place that was put in place by influenza to be able to respond and adapt a technology that was [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1198.26s)]
*  previously used for seasonal flu and adapt that vaccine to respond to a pandemic influenza strain [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1205.46s)]
*  and avian influenza strain. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1214.38s)]
*  What the mRNA technology allows us to do is make that adaptation to a new strain quite quickly and [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1216.1000000000001s)]
*  with a high fidelity. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1224.42s)]
*  So it's really one of the leaps forward in pandemic preparedness is the use of programmable [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1225.98s)]
*  technologies like mRNA. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1230.7800000000002s)]
*  Older technologies would have required that that avian influenza strain be adapted to eggs grown in [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1232.5400000000002s)]
*  eggs and then six to nine months later you have purified a pandemic strain, quote unquote, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1240.86s)]
*  matched to the avian threat. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1247.54s)]
*  What we can do is leverage the data processes that we've put in place for COVID and make that [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1250.78s)]
*  adaptation in days rather than months. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1255.5s)]
*  And we can do that without the requirement of adapting an avian influenza strain to an egg based [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1258.7s)]
*  vaccine technology. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1264.6599999999999s)]
*  So when we think about our ability to respond to avian influenza, what we are doing now at Moderna is [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1265.86s)]
*  advancing a seasonal mRNA based vaccine and in parallel advancing in early clinical development vaccine [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1272.54s)]
*  compositions that are matched to the currently circulating H5 avian influenza strain. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1282.7s)]
*  And that's in preparation for not only this subtype of vaccine, but also to ready data packages that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1288.22s)]
*  support the use of an mRNA technology across a breadth of influenza strains with pandemic potential. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1296.3400000000001s)]
*  Could you already kind of mentioned disease X? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1304.3s)]
*  I wonder if you could kind of go into a bit more detail on the disease X concept. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1307.14s)]
*  Sure. So disease X is a concept that came from the recognition that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1312.18s)]
*  new infectious diseases are going to emerge and can emerge unexpectedly and from various different [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1318.42s)]
*  kind of viral families. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1325.14s)]
*  Disease X really tends to focus on viruses. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1326.66s)]
*  It was to challenge the research community, the academic community, the biotech community to make [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1329.74s)]
*  sure that we are not becoming too focused and too narrowly scoped to responding to specific [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1336.7s)]
*  diseases like Ebola, like Zika without thinking about how do we prepare for the unknown? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1346.26s)]
*  And so what we have done to pull this back to COVID is, had we focused on MERS or SARS-CoV-2 as [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1353.22s)]
*  specific pathogens, the priority would have been to develop vaccines against those threats all the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1362.22s)]
*  way to licensure, because that's historically what we do in the industry is we go through rigorous [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1369.7800000000002s)]
*  clinical and manufacturing efforts to prove that you have a safe and effective vaccine and then we [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1375.34s)]
*  have a licensed product. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1380.54s)]
*  But when you do that, you are missing an opportunity to translate that understanding to other [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1382.4599999999998s)]
*  pathogens that might also be a threat, like a MERS, for example. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1389.58s)]
*  And so what we are doing through disease X is say we don't know what the threat landscape truly looks [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1394.3799999999999s)]
*  like. So rather than run environmental surveillance for a specific list of 50 pathogens, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1401.58s)]
*  for example, think about how to create assays and detection mechanisms that are more agnostic to the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1409.1799999999998s)]
*  specific threat and are detecting genetic information a little bit more broadly. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1417.5s)]
*  And that allows us to start to map different pieces of that threat landscape and that environment. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1422.78s)]
*  When you then take that surveillance information and then start to move into the preclinical, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1429.66s)]
*  what we think of as classical research base, you then are not only designing assays for a specific [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1434.78s)]
*  pathogen, but you're also thinking what would be required for this assay to work on other pathogens? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1442.78s)]
*  Is it sequence dependent? Is it pathology dependent? And how do I expand this lens back out so that I'm [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1448.06s)]
*  able to quickly update the tools that I have in my toolbox for this new threat? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1456.94s)]
*  And that's what we're doing quite a bit now, not only in the priority pathogen space, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1462.14s)]
*  but post COVID, there's the G7 in coordination with CEPI announced this 100 day mission. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1466.7s)]
*  And what the 100 day mission is driving towards is to be able to respond to any disease X threat [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1473.42s)]
*  within 100 days. So I mentioned previously that our COVID updated vaccines have been released [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1481.1s)]
*  two years in a row now on a roughly 100 day timeline. But that is because we have a license [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1487.7399999999998s)]
*  product and a process to update that. So with disease X and the 100 day mission, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1493.6599999999999s)]
*  those between the WHO and the G7 and CEPI are really challenging the public health community [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1499.6599999999999s)]
*  to say, what would you need to put in place now so that anytime there is a threat, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1506.3s)]
*  from a disease X threat or other, we're able to have a similar response timeline? And how do you [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1512.62s)]
*  use this inter pandemic time to really ready yourself to accelerate a response when it needs [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1517.98s)]
*  to occur? Do you think that we're better positioned now than we ever were to tackle pandemics, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1525.1s)]
*  regardless of the origin and what it actually is? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1531.9s)]
*  I do think that coming out of COVID-19 and what we all experienced in 2020, we are much better [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1535.58s)]
*  positioned now to respond to the next outbreak, ideally respond to an outbreak before it becomes [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1542.06s)]
*  a global pandemic, but certainly to respond to a pandemic. We're talking as an industry and as a [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1548.78s)]
*  public health community, we're talking about the end to end system in which we engage in public [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1555.34s)]
*  health and response. We're talking about surveillance in ways that I haven't seen us talk about [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1564.3s)]
*  surveillance before. And for the first time, really talking about the role that climate change plays [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1568.4599999999998s)]
*  in the threat that we face with outbreaks. I think those of us in the community have talked about that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1575.26s)]
*  for years, but I was just last week at the United Nations General Assembly where they had their [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1580.7s)]
*  first high level meeting on pandemic preparedness and response. And it was directly tied to climate [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1586.22s)]
*  change and the increase in exposure events that are happening as a result of climate disruption. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1592.54s)]
*  So I think we're talking about surveillance and detection and just the interplay of humans and [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1599.26s)]
*  environment in a way that's never been talked about before. And that's really encouraging. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1604.3s)]
*  I think there's a recognition from the research and development community that we need to think [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1608.38s)]
*  about the systems in which we operate differently and put processes in place that allow us as a [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1613.8200000000002s)]
*  platform company to look across aggregate data to say, what do I know that translates to other [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1620.38s)]
*  products? What do I not know and is uncertain if I need to respond quickly? And then we're also [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1625.8200000000002s)]
*  looking at health systems to say, what were the gaps that prevented vaccine from getting into arms? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1631.82s)]
*  How do you address misinformation and vaccine hesitancy? How do we think about strengthening [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1638.54s)]
*  health systems to make sure that there are vaccine administrators on site, that people trust the [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1644.54s)]
*  health systems, that they're resourced so that there are nurses and health practitioners available? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1650.9399999999998s)]
*  All of this is being talked about in a really comprehensive way that is new and I think is a [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1656.46s)]
*  result of just the devastation that we all went through in COVID-19. And it is sort of a silver [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1664.46s)]
*  lining if there is one that has come from COVID-19 is that I think we are much better positioned now [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1669.66s)]
*  than we have ever been to make sure that that doesn't happen again. There's a couple of points [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1675.26s)]
*  that you mentioned there that I'd like to ask about. One of them is the inequity we saw with [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1679.9s)]
*  COVID and also that we're seeing with climate change in so far as some countries are affected [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1686.5400000000002s)]
*  worse than others and also some countries don't seem to have the means to be able to tackle this, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1692.8600000000001s)]
*  whether it's financial or geographic or whatever it is. Is that something that's being considered? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1699.02s)]
*  The fact that UK, US, Japan, all able to deal with the financial aspects of this, but what about [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1705.5s)]
*  Africa, South America? Yes, we have thought as an industry and as Moderna, thought quite a bit about [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1712.94s)]
*  health equity and the role that we play as a pharmaceutical company in making sure that our [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1720.94s)]
*  products are available to the people that need them most. We took a couple steps during COVID that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1726.06s)]
*  were really innovative for a pharmaceutical company and have never really been done before [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1732.3s)]
*  to make sure that the COVID-19 vaccine was getting to people that needed it most. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1737.82s)]
*  We early on communicated that we would not be enforcing our COVID-19 patents [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1742.22s)]
*  in countries where they were manufacturing in and for low middle income countries and our position [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1749.74s)]
*  was that we never want our IP to be a barrier to access to people that need vaccine. We also, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1755.42s)]
*  with the US government who procured a vast majority of the early product that we had, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1763.18s)]
*  worked with them while they were still opening borders and allowing export to make sure that [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1769.18s)]
*  as much product as we could was donated to LMICs early on in 2021. But both of those were [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1774.6200000000001s)]
*  in the moment responses. What we are now doing is saying how do we make that response more durable [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1782.9399999999998s)]
*  as Moderna and as an industry? So as Moderna, what we've done is think about how we distribute [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1790.4599999999998s)]
*  our manufacturing footprint globally to bring manufacturing closer to the regions around the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1796.4599999999998s)]
*  world so that you have distributed manufacturing that allows us to respond to the needs of disparate [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1803.1799999999998s)]
*  communities. That's one thing that we've done over the last few years is expand the manufacturing [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1808.7s)]
*  footprint. As an industry, we also agreed to what is called the Berlin Declaration and what that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1814.22s)]
*  says is that we recognize that communicable diseases are going to be a threat to everyone [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1820.6200000000001s)]
*  and we need to make product available to populations that are experiencing a disease threat [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1826.54s)]
*  in real time and in sufficient numbers. So what that is doing is signaling across the industry, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1833.9s)]
*  but also to the governments that might be threatening to close their borders, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1839.66s)]
*  that we believe that putting health equity at the forefront of any response is critical. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1843.42s)]
*  We will make sure to the best of our ability that product is available to the people that need it [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1849.58s)]
*  and that we expect that governments and our supply partners will step up and help us deliver against [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1855.18s)]
*  that. You've mentioned the industry several times. I wonder, is there a lot of cooperation [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1862.22s)]
*  and openness within the industry when it comes to different companies trying to tackle this together? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1869.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'll say that I've worked in vaccines my entire career, so this is the only industry [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1876.94s)]
*  that I know. I've always found it to be a highly collaborative industry and group and I think it's [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1883.74s)]
*  because you find people when you're working in the vaccine space, your mission is public health. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1890.14s)]
*  You're there to serve the community and you're trying to develop vaccines or medicines that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1896.22s)]
*  are putting the public and the person first. So that's always your objective is to say, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1902.7800000000002s)]
*  how can I best help this person in this community? And the vaccine space is really, I think, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1908.0600000000002s)]
*  unique in that kind of collaborative space. What we've also saw during COVID, during the peak of [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1914.7s)]
*  2020, there were six or eight global manufacturers. There were very much more that were kind of [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1920.46s)]
*  specific to certain countries, but kind of if we think about vaccines that were capable of [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1927.74s)]
*  distributing around the globe, there were six leading companies and each one of us was really [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1932.7s)]
*  required in order to produce the amount of vaccine that the world needed. We needed every [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1938.6200000000001s)]
*  company to be successful. So it is not a one company versus another or one technology versus [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1943.5s)]
*  another because that doesn't serve the public. And we carry that mindset not just in times of [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1949.5s)]
*  global pandemic, but that also influences the way that we engage with each other across products, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1956.46s)]
*  across threats, because what we need to do is make the environment more equitable and more sustainable [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1962.06s)]
*  for the entire vaccine and the public health community so that we can get vaccines to people [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1969.1799999999998s)]
*  faster and that those vaccines are accepted by the public and are accessible to the public. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1974.1399999999999s)]
*  And we're all working towards that shared mission and we are much stronger when we do that together. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1979.1s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Does that kind of extend to using different approaches? I know that you work with [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1984.3799999999999s)]
*  mRNA technology, but do you expect that that would be the main means of treating something like a [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1990.2199999999998s)]
*  disease X or do you think that a multitude of approaches is necessary or useful? I think we're [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=1996.46s)]
*  still exploring where mRNA is best suited. So I'll start with mRNA and then I'll kind of zoom out to [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2002.7s)]
*  the other technologies. We have a very high success rate in the research space with mRNA [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2010.54s)]
*  because we know that if you are encoding for the right antigen and that antigen you believe [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2017.98s)]
*  produces a protective immune response, you can start to show that pre-clinically and what we see [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2024.7s)]
*  is a very strong translation of that response into protective responses in people. So as we think [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2029.82s)]
*  about uncertainty, the mRNA technology, like other programmable technologies, allows you to remove a [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2036.14s)]
*  lot of that uncertainty and so you can move with confidence to build a portfolio and accelerate [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2041.9s)]
*  that portfolio. It's one of the reasons why Moderna has the one of the largest infectious [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2047.26s)]
*  disease portfolios of any company that is out there is because we have a lot of confidence in [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2050.78s)]
*  our platform and the way that we can deploy it. But we don't know if mRNA is the appropriate [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2056.0600000000004s)]
*  technology for everything. We're still learning about how does it work with bacterial targets and [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2062.1400000000003s)]
*  we've had some really good programs that are in early development now. We're still learning about [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2069.1000000000004s)]
*  how it works with parasites and those are programs that we're still exploring the utility of mRNA. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2073.9s)]
*  And trying to ask is mRNA the right technology where our value is really on and innovation is [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2080.78s)]
*  really on speed and scale of response or do you want to work with an alternate technology that [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2087.1000000000004s)]
*  potentially is something that's more accessible for low middle income countries? At Moderna, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2094.94s)]
*  we're exploring that space through a program that we have called mRNA access and what that program [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2099.98s)]
*  does is it allows researchers, academic researchers around the world to use our platform [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2105.98s)]
*  to develop new vaccines against emerging or neglected infectious diseases that are of interest [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2113.42s)]
*  to them. So rather than Moderna explore disease areas where we might not have direct expertise, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2121.02s)]
*  we are experts on our platform but we share our platform with external collaborators and through [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2128.62s)]
*  their expertise hopefully we design better vaccines and say is mRNA the right technology [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2134.22s)]
*  for this disease area? When we then think about is it mRNA or another technology, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2139.58s)]
*  I think there's a lot of space for programmable technologies and I'm really excited by the way [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2145.02s)]
*  that this field has shifted from older inactivated attenuated vaccine design and there used to be [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2150.06s)]
*  this mantra in the vaccine space that the process is the product. It's something that we used to say [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2157.4199999999996s)]
*  quite a bit in vaccines because there was this special sauce that came from the process of [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2163.1s)]
*  inactivating or attenuating a pathogen but it became very difficult to really characterize what [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2169.18s)]
*  was driving a protective response and as the research field becomes more aware of programmable [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2175.3399999999997s)]
*  technologies where you're able to encode specific antigens, we are applying a precision medicine [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2183.18s)]
*  approach to vaccine design for the future and whether that's a vector technology or an mRNA [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2189.9s)]
*  and for a while we were exploring DNA vaccine, we as an industry were exploring DNA vaccines, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2196.78s)]
*  that precision allows us to really refine the response that we're generating in people and it [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2201.34s)]
*  will allow us to take forward more effective vaccines and vaccines that are safer and more [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2208.54s)]
*  tolerable and I think we've seen that with Moderna's portfolio that we've been able to [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2213.82s)]
*  bring forward in the respiratory space over the last few years but also we're seeing that in this [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2218.3s)]
*  kind of massive innovation that we're in the vaccine space and new vaccines are being approved [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2222.94s)]
*  a much higher rate because we're able to apply these sort of precision medicine tools [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2229.98s)]
*  to a technology that was previously pretty archaic. Are there any things that you would like to [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2234.7000000000003s)]
*  see adopted in cases of new outbreaks so that you can approach it more quickly, more efficiently? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2241.18s)]
*  I think one of the most exciting spaces for me in disease X preparedness or kind of outbreak response [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2249.2599999999998s)]
*  is this consideration of how do we look across our platform technology and leverage the data [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2258.94s)]
*  that we've been generating for the last few years and the knowledge that we've been building [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2267.42s)]
*  over the last 13 years. I think if we can help regulators and health authorities understand [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2273.42s)]
*  the safety, the tolerability, the effectiveness of our vaccines in aggregate, the more that we [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2282.46s)]
*  can bring them along in that process with us, we will create an environment where we have [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2289.82s)]
*  an equal sharing of information that allows us to collectively move quickly towards the next [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2297.5800000000004s)]
*  response that we need to mount. So right now we spend a lot of time engaging health authorities [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2303.42s)]
*  on these prototype pathogens, on the NEPA vaccines, on Ebola vaccines, on MERS vaccines [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2309.82s)]
*  to help them understand where do we need to create novel data packages and where do we think we can [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2318.3s)]
*  learn from our prior experience on related pathogens or from the platform at large. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2323.26s)]
*  And the more that we can have those conversations and do so with the awareness that the expectation [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2328.38s)]
*  is to apply this to a disease X in the future, I think we're going to be in a much better place. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2335.9s)]
*  And so I'm excited to be having those conversations and to be met from the health authority with a [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2341.1000000000004s)]
*  willingness to say we want to be part of the solution because it's going to take a cross [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2346.78s)]
*  functional kind of inter-industry response to translate what we're now able to do in COVID [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2351.5s)]
*  to any other pathogen or any other disease. I assume in that regard that COVID probably helped [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2356.38s)]
*  with making sure that companies are more proactive than they are reactive? Yes, I hope that when we're [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2364.46s)]
*  talking about whether we can be proactive or reactive, it's not enough for any one member of [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2372.14s)]
*  this kind of larger table to respond on their own. We have to bring our partners along with us [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2380.2999999999997s)]
*  because as an industry I can be as proactive as I'd like, but if I'm not engaging with health [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2390.2999999999997s)]
*  authority, if I'm not engaging with either the regulators or the ministries of health or the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2395.9s)]
*  communities to understand what their priorities and what their needs are, I'm going to be moving [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2400.78s)]
*  alone. And that's never a good place to be in in the public health space. It's important that you [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2404.94s)]
*  find that balance of pushing for innovation. And I think that's what the beauty of this 100 day [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2410.1400000000003s)]
*  mission does is it sets that goal of innovating towards something, but it does it in a way where [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2415.5s)]
*  we can collectively all sit around a table and have conversations about how to do that together [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2422.78s)]
*  so that we don't end up in a place where we're thinking about what is best for proactive response [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2428.7s)]
*  and not having a conversation with the additional stakeholders that take into account their [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2437.8999999999996s)]
*  perspective. And so that when you're being proactive, you're doing it in a very efficient [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2444.14s)]
*  and productive way. You don't want to be complacent, but are you generally optimistic about our ability [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2448.46s)]
*  to respond to new threats and the reemergence of potentially old threats? I'm quite optimistic [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2455.34s)]
*  about our ability to respond to threats as they're emerging, whether it's known or unknown. And I [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2462.7000000000003s)]
*  think that's because we have now demonstrated that we can respond quickly when needed. And that alone, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2468.06s)]
*  removing that uncertainty allows us to eliminate a lot of the conversations that I think would have [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2478.3s)]
*  happened before about, are we even capable? We know that we're capable. Now it's a question of how do [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2483.66s)]
*  we want to respond? And so that's where our energy is focused now is to say, how do we bring forward [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2490.38s)]
*  the best products? How do we bring forward a product that is going to have the greatest impact [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2494.7s)]
*  to public health and to do that in a way that is putting equity and access at the front of that [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2499.58s)]
*  discussion? So I think that I'm encouraged by the way that the community is responding to the [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2507.1s)]
*  uncertainty that we will continue to face, but with a recognition that we have the ability to [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2513.58s)]
*  really have an impact if we're focused. It's not all doom and gloom. I think we're in a really good [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2519.1s)]
*  place. I definitely enjoyed that interview, although let's hope we don't need to respond [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2523.98s)]
*  to another pandemic for a little while at least. How quickly we've forgotten standing two meters [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2532.94s)]
*  apart stockpiling toilet paper and steamed up glasses because of face masks, and not to mention [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2538.94s)]
*  all of the travel chaos. Hopefully none of that when I head out again later in the week to Germany [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2545.26s)]
*  for a short trip for another event. Of course I have tons to do to get ready, so I had better go [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2550.86s)]
*  some of that now. So don't forget to take a look into whatever happened to Rudolf Diesel, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2557.98s)]
*  and let me know what you think happened. And a quick reminder to check out all of the latest [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2563.02s)]
*  news and articles at lebiotech.eu, and I hope wherever in the world you are you have a great [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2568.2200000000003s)]
*  week ahead. Thanks for listening, and you'll join us next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPLVPgdp3Y&t=2574.3s)]
