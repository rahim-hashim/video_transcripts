Video Description: Are TCR-NK treatments the next big thing in cell therapies for cancer patients?

As biotechs and pharma companies continue to innovate to address patient needs in oncology, T-cell receptor therapies, or TCR-Ts, are attracting significant interest and investment. There are already some promising results for TCR-Ts tackling solid tumors – but one Norwegian biotech is taking a slightly different track.

This week, we sit down with Namir Hassan, CEO of Zelluna, a company with a mission to eliminate solid cancers by pioneering the development of T cell receptor guided natural killer, or TCR-NK, cell therapies.

# TCR-NK: A novel cell therapy transforming cancer treatment
**Beyond Biotech:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ)
*  Hello and welcome to Beyond Biotech, the weekly podcast from LeBioTech. I'm Dylan Kusane and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  this is episode 145 for the podcast. As biotechs and pharma companies continue to innovate [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=11.8s)]
*  to address patient needs and oncology, T cell receptor therapies or TCRTs are attracting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=18.68s)]
*  significant interest and investment. There are already some promising results for TCRTs [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=25.16s)]
*  tackling solid tumors, but one Norwegian biotech is taking a slightly different track. This week [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=30.32s)]
*  I sat down with Nirmir Hassan, CEO of Zaluna, a company with a mission to eliminate solid cancers [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=37.0s)]
*  by unleashing the most powerful elements of the immune system. They are pioneering the development [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  of T cell receptor guided natural killer or TCRNK cell therapies, an approach they believe to be [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=49.88s)]
*  novel, safe, potent and capable of scaling as an off-the-shelf therapy for large populations. I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  hope you enjoy my discussion with Nirmir. So Nirmir, welcome to Beyond Biotech. You're from [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Zaluna and Zaluna is a listed company, that's right? That's correct. Thanks, Dylan. Great to join [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=73.28s)]
*  you here. So perhaps before we get going, I'll just make a statement since we're a listed company. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=80.56s)]
*  Zaluna is a publicly traded company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and information on risks and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=86.52s)]
*  opportunities of investing can be found in filings and disclosures to the Oslo Stock Exchange and in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=92.56s)]
*  the investors section on our website. Well, that's the nuts and bolts of Zaluna. Let's maybe start [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=98.56s)]
*  by talking a little bit about yourself. What essentially drew you in to immunology and T cell [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=104.56s)]
*  biology in the first place? So from quite a young age, I had a strong inclination to serve, to help [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=111.16s)]
*  people and then a growing interest in the workings of the human body, homeostasis, how we remain [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=122.56s)]
*  healthy, how disease comes about and importantly, how we may be able to intervene. And so immunology [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=131.96s)]
*  really felt like it sat at the intersection of my purpose and passion. And so I further delved into [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=140.2s)]
*  the whole intricate arena of immunology, particularly during my PhD, where I studied deeply the function [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  of the T cell receptor, which is a receptor that sits on T cells, a major component of the immune [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=158.8s)]
*  system. And arguably the T cell receptor is perhaps the most powerful biological entity we have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=165.36s)]
*  discovered in 1984. It quite literally makes a decision of whether to kill a cell or not. And so that for me was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=173.32s)]
*  incredibly fascinating. And then spent time after that in various roles, 15 plus years of my [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=185.24s)]
*  professional career in actually developing components of the immune system to combat cancer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=195.24s)]
*  You wrote your PhD, where did you study? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=201.08s)]
*  I studied at Oxford at the Cellular Immunology Unit at Oxford University, with a really remarkable group [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  headed by Neil Barthley. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=213.4s)]
*  And you moved after your PhD, you moved through Immunicor. And there was some some pretty [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  groundbreaking work that you did there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes, immediately after my PhD, I actually spent some time at GSK for almost six years. And the way [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=224.36s)]
*  I think about it when I connect the dots looking backwards as it were, is I really learned the discipline [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=231.0s)]
*  of drug discovery and development in large pharma at GSK. And then after that, as you say, moved to Immunicor [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=237.88s)]
*  and it was really a privilege to be working at Immunicor. At the time, I was the 41st employee. I was there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  for just over nine years. And when I left, the company was 450 people. So had seen that growth. And from an [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  operational standpoint, was really lucky to be involved in the early development of what became known as [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=264.88s)]
*  Kimtrak, the first ever T cell receptor by specific to be approved for uveal melanoma. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=272.36s)]
*  What sort of lessons did you take from your time there? Because you, if you came in as employee 41, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=279.76s)]
*  and then by the time you left, there were 10 times as many people. You must have got business lessons [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=285.76s)]
*  and lessons in growth and scaling. Tell me about it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=291.36s)]
*  Oh, the lessons are many. But if I was to think of two or three and focus on those that I carry forward, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=296.4s)]
*  I think one of the key lessons is focus. Immunicor had been developing a platform technology that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=304.8s)]
*  potentially could be deployed into a number of different therapeutic areas. But there was a [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=311.12s)]
*  deliberate focus initially in oncology. And that was to demonstrate the validity of the platform. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=317.36s)]
*  And then once that was established, spreading to other therapeutic areas. So focus, particularly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  for a small biotech, is really a strong principle that I carry. And then the second is, we really [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=331.92s)]
*  understood quite a lot about how the therapy works in patients from relatively few patients. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=340.0s)]
*  And so through biopsy analysis, but also through the clinical data that was emerging from the first [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=349.92s)]
*  patients, we came to realise the mechanism of action of the therapy and began to develop [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  strategies on the back of very small patient numbers. And one example of that is we were [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=364.88s)]
*  treating melanoma patients. And melanoma is also a conglomerate of subsets of different melanoma [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  types. One of those is what's called UVL melanoma, which is around 5% of the patient population. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=379.12s)]
*  And unbeknown to us at the time, once we started to treat patients, we began to see strong signals [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=386.4s)]
*  in UVL melanoma, which is a really high unmet medical need melanoma type. And that came through [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=392.88s)]
*  from relatively few patients, and then began to define the strategy and ultimately the commercial [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=400.32s)]
*  strategy where that product is now approved. So focus and understanding and learning from [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=406.56s)]
*  few patients. You moved from Immunocore over to Zaluna, and you joined as a CSO. What was it [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=414.64s)]
*  about the company that made you take that jump and take that leap? I would say two things. The [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=424.32s)]
*  first is the scientific rationale for what Zaluna had in its approach. And that's, for me, largely [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=431.36s)]
*  that was the TCRNK approach, which I can come on to describe. But again, for me, it was the next [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=441.04s)]
*  evolutionary step to T cell receptor-based therapies. And we can talk a bit more about that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=449.68s)]
*  The second was the organization, a small organization. I joined and we did not have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  any infrastructure for the science. There was no science being generated within the organization. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=463.04s)]
*  It was being generated through academic groups and also the people involved. So organization [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=468.4s)]
*  involves the people. It's a great group of people, highly engaged and passionate to develop these [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=474.4s)]
*  novel therapies. So scientific concept, organization, and being back in that building mode. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=481.76s)]
*  Were you still able to get into the lab yourself at this stage or at this point you were [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  on the operations side more than anything else? If they let me, I tried to get into the lab as [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=494.64s)]
*  much as possible. You know, one thing I say sometimes is when you're the first seeing [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=501.2s)]
*  the data come off that experiment, there's little else that beats that joy in life. So [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=510.96s)]
*  if I'm able, I tried to get into the lab. You started at CSO, but you made the transition [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=519.84s)]
*  to CEO a couple of years ago. What motivated that transition? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  So as we were heading through 2019 towards the end of 2019, there were a couple of things happening. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=535.2s)]
*  The former CEO was transitioning to another organization, a clinical stage organization, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=542.64s)]
*  and internally we had decided to pivot to focus completely on a T cell receptor natural killer [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  cell strategy, TCRNK. And so over those two events, I was then asked to lead the organization as CEO [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=557.84s)]
*  and we then from then on have been building the organization around our platform technology, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=571.52s)]
*  the TCRNK platform. Is it something you imagined yourself doing back as a PhD student in leading [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=577.52s)]
*  an organization and getting out of the lab? Not necessarily with respect to role, but as I [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=584.16s)]
*  followed my passion, one of my passions has been to try to unleash the potential of people and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=594.4s)]
*  organizations and groups for maximum impact on patient lives. And so perhaps naturally that has [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=604.0s)]
*  drawn me to where I am today, but not necessarily out of a deliberate intent for a role. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=613.6s)]
*  Now you mentioned at the top there that Zaluna is now listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. It's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=620.88s)]
*  the first cell therapy company that's listed there. Can you walk me through how you took the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=626.0s)]
*  company public and what that milestone really means for the company in its future? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=631.28s)]
*  Yes, so over the last months we have been, and years as we've been developing our platform [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=637.52s)]
*  technology, we are now at a stage where we have a lead asset that we're very excited by [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=647.76s)]
*  that's advancing towards clinical testing on the one hand. And on the other hand, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=655.2s)]
*  there is a company called Ultimavax, which has been listed on the stock exchange for a number of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=663.84s)]
*  years on the Oslo Stock Exchange. They have been developing a peptide-based vaccine and they have [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=670.88s)]
*  had a number of a few top-line phase two results that were unfortunately negative, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=676.88s)]
*  but they had executed across a wide range of phase two studies across a number of territories, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=685.04s)]
*  many patients, and so had developed clinical capability in order to be able to operationally [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=692.96s)]
*  execute with their programs. And we also shared some of the main shareholders across [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=699.84s)]
*  both companies. And so we had in our hands an exciting lead asset that's advancing to the clinic [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  on the one hand, and on the other hand there is this organization that had failed top-line results [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=718.0s)]
*  listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and we had shared some of the main shareholders. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=724.8s)]
*  So together with both boards and with Anders Tuv, who is a seasoned entrepreneur in the biotech space, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=729.92s)]
*  now our chairman for Zaluna, we worked on a combination where we felt that there was merit [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=740.48s)]
*  in Zaluna being listed in the Oslo Stock Exchange, particularly from a perspective of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  flexibility of investment and also absorbing the clinical capability as we're planning to move [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=755.12s)]
*  to a clinical study with our lead asset. So it really came together beautifully when it comes [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=764.08s)]
*  to those elements. Let's talk a little bit about the work that you're actually doing with these [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=771.52s)]
*  T cell receptors. You started at Zaluna with TCR T therapies and then you said you shifted focus [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=777.44s)]
*  to the TCR NK. Let's just start by getting those acronyms out of the way. So TCR, T cell receptors, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=784.6400000000001s)]
*  the T, the NK, can you define those for me? Yeah, so T cell receptors, TCR, they're naturally [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=793.7600000000001s)]
*  found on T cells, which is a cell type, one of the dominant cell types in the immune system. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=801.5200000000001s)]
*  And their function is to surveil cells and trigger against those cells and kill cells that are [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=807.12s)]
*  diseased or save them, leave them alone if they're not. And the NK cells or natural killer cells are [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=816.0s)]
*  again a key component of the immune system. They're the first line of defense. As the name [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=826.0799999999999s)]
*  suggests, they're highly potent killers, perhaps the most efficient cellular killers in our body. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=831.52s)]
*  And so we originally had a strategy, which was the dominating strategy when I joined, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=842.0s)]
*  which was to develop a T cell receptor T cell therapy, an autologous therapy, meaning [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=848.48s)]
*  therapy where you generate one batch for a patient, you manufacture a single batch for a patient. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=854.72s)]
*  And that was being developed. And when I joined, it was in the process of being manufactured. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=861.68s)]
*  In parallel, we had a T cell receptor natural killer cell strategy where the company would be [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=869.04s)]
*  putting T cell receptors into natural killer cells. It was a new idea. It was a novel idea. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=877.6s)]
*  It also had a number of merits, which we can come to talk about. And so as we moved forward into 2019, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=886.72s)]
*  we saw the huge benefit and potential in the TCRNK platform for its merits. And before investing [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=896.72s)]
*  heavily in the TCRT program and moving that into the clinic, we decided to make the difficult [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  decision to pivot completely to TCRNK on account of the potential we saw there. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=911.6s)]
*  And of course, it wasn't an easy decision. Many right decisions tend to be the most difficult ones. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=917.84s)]
*  But certainly in hindsight, it really has been vindicated. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  These TCRNK cell therapies, what specific cancers are they actually targeting? What are you looking [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=931.2s)]
*  at there? So we're developing a lead asset, which targets a particular antigen called MAGE A4. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=939.84s)]
*  It's probably the most clinically validated target for a T cell receptor. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  And with that, we are aiming at a number of indications. There are many possibilities, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  because many cancers actually express or make that target. So the options are very many. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=960.72s)]
*  And therein is also the advantage of a T cell receptor. There are a number of validated targets [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=968.4s)]
*  out there that are cancer associated or cancer restricted. So we would be initially looking at [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  what's called a bucket study, which is a number of cancers, ovarian cancer, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=982.56s)]
*  head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, for example. So a number of these [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=988.16s)]
*  really high unmet medical need cancer types. And how are you stacking up to [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=994.16s)]
*  others who are working in the field? I mean, there are alternative therapies that people [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1000.8s)]
*  are using there. How does this particular approach stack up? So we're the only company, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  as far as we know, that's developing T cell receptor natural killer cells. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1012.56s)]
*  So it's a highly differentiated novel approach. And whilst it's extremely novel, the separated [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1017.36s)]
*  components are clinically validated. So the T cell receptor itself as a scaffold has been [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1026.4s)]
*  clinically proven to have the ability to target solid cancers. There are three approved T cell [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1033.04s)]
*  receptor based therapies that demonstrate a T cell receptor can target solid cancers. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1038.96s)]
*  So there's clinical validation there. Natural killer cells themselves are also highly potent [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1044.48s)]
*  and safe. We know that through a number of decades of clinical data. And so we bring [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1049.44s)]
*  together clinically validated components in this novel approach. Now, when we look across [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1055.76s)]
*  at the field, there are T cell based therapies. And when we compare to T cell based therapies, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1061.04s)]
*  whether they're targeting with a T cell receptor or a chimeric antigen receptor, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1068.16s)]
*  which is another way of targeting T cells, they remain T cells, which means that they are [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1074.08s)]
*  targeting with that one receptor. And this maybe I can explain in a little more detail, because [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  it's a major challenge in the field, whereby in solid cancers, most patients, virtually all [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1090.96s)]
*  patients will relapse. Whilst we've seen very compelling data with, for example, T cell receptor [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1099.76s)]
*  based therapies in solid cancers across multiple indications, meaning that tumours have shrunk, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1108.4s)]
*  and we've seen clinical positive clinical data, virtually all patients will have their cancers [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1115.28s)]
*  return and unfortunately will die as a consequence of the disease. And one of the main reasons for [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1121.04s)]
*  that is because cancers are very diverse and heterogeneous. So they're varied, they have [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1128.4s)]
*  multiple faces. And so when you're attacking a tumour with a very precise therapy, the advantage [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  is that the safety profile is favourable, but the disadvantage is that the cancer can escape. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1142.72s)]
*  And so T cell based therapies attack tumours with a single receptor, whereas an NK cell [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1149.76s)]
*  naturally can recognise diverse cancers. It has multiple levers that can be activated [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1158.24s)]
*  with different cancers. And so it can better address diverse cancers. And so that's one of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1165.6s)]
*  the key differences between T cell and natural killer cell therapies. And then what we do on [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1173.68s)]
*  top of that, where natural killer cells struggle, is to target solid cancers, is to get into the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1179.76s)]
*  tumour. And that's where we bring the T cell receptor to help with that process to target [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1187.36s)]
*  solid cancers. So what we believe is necessary in the field to really drive durable responses [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1193.2s)]
*  is precision and breadth, to precisely target solid tumours, but to have a broad activity whereby [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1199.92s)]
*  you can recognise the multiple faces of cancer and avoid them from escaping. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1207.52s)]
*  I guess this is one way that you're positioning yourself in terms of a differentiation [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1215.68s)]
*  to traditional or existing T cell therapies. Are you finding any success so far? Or is this still [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1223.2s)]
*  very much theoretical? So we're at the preclinical stage at the moment. And we have over the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1229.52s)]
*  years been building the science to demonstrate that the hypothesis of bringing together a T [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1237.44s)]
*  cell receptor with a natural killer cell and technically it can be done. And thankfully, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1244.16s)]
*  today I can say that we have the depth of scientific data that now demonstrates the function of T cell [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1252.72s)]
*  receptor natural killer cells and indeed targeting via the T cell receptor, but also [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1263.6s)]
*  maintaining the innate killing ability of natural killer cells. So under our head of research, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1270.32s)]
*  Louise Weigand, we have really developed a solid foundation of the science. And now what we want [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1277.12s)]
*  to do is see how that translates clinically. And so we've been really building around generating [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1284.0s)]
*  a product through our partners under the supervision of Emily Gaultier, who's our [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1291.12s)]
*  head of CMC, and really advancing towards the clinic to understand whether this reads out into [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1296.8799999999999s)]
*  the clinic. And is the clinic far away at this point? So we aim to submit a clinical trial [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1302.8s)]
*  application or IND sometime in the second half of this year. You're talking about building these [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1311.28s)]
*  solutions. You're emphasized, at least on the website, as an off the shelf solution for TCR. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1320.0s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about what it means to be an off the shelf solution as opposed to [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1328.72s)]
*  other therapies that are out there? Sure. So I discussed one of the biological problems [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1333.6s)]
*  that the field is facing when it comes to treating solid cancers, and that's the diversity of cancer. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1339.76s)]
*  So that's one of the biological problems. The other challenges and limitation has been [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1345.44s)]
*  scalability of cell therapies. And some people may have heard about off the shelf or allogenic cell [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1353.04s)]
*  therapies. And the idea there is that you produce a single batch or a batch of the product that may [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1360.8s)]
*  then serve tens or hundreds of doses and may serve many patients, multiple doses for many patients [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1369.12s)]
*  from a single batch. And so that material would be stored and then would be used at the point of need, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1377.4399999999998s)]
*  so off the shelf. And that's different to the paradigm of manufacturing a single batch per [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1385.04s)]
*  patient. And so naturally, one can imagine that the off the shelf approach would be much more [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1391.28s)]
*  amenable to scaling the therapy, which would be very much needed in order to really meet the [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1397.44s)]
*  potential demand. Solid tumors constitute 90% of global cancer burden. There are thousands upon [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1404.4s)]
*  thousands of patients that would potentially be needing and could benefit from these therapies. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1411.2s)]
*  And so natural killer cells can naturally be used in an off the shelf fashion, meaning that a single [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1417.68s)]
*  batch of material from a donor, a healthy donor, their natural killer cells can be used in others [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1425.2s)]
*  without causing any toxicity, without causing any graft versus host disease, for example. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1432.56s)]
*  We know that from decades of clinical data on natural killer cells. Hence, they're naturally [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1438.88s)]
*  off the shelf or naturally allogenic, which is not the case for T cells, where T cells from one person [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1444.56s)]
*  can cause graft versus host disease if they're used in another person. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1451.52s)]
*  This is certainly sounds more cost effective, but you must be working with partners then to make [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1456.48s)]
*  sure that it's scalable, the manufacturing. Yeah, so the model we've adopted, and this is fairly [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1461.68s)]
*  common for small biotech, is to partner with expert manufacturers that have done this before [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1467.92s)]
*  with other types of cell therapies. And we've done the same and we've been working with them [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1477.52s)]
*  for a number of years really to develop our manufacturing process. And we do expect that [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1482.4s)]
*  the cost of goods would be favorable. That's another advantage for this. And also we expect [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1488.16s)]
*  that we'll be able to generate hundreds of doses from our manufacturing process. And that's the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1495.84s)]
*  expectation and we have seen that for other products where companies are also developing [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1503.52s)]
*  natural killer cell therapies. So it's precedented. So these manufacturing partnerships are really [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1509.44s)]
*  important. Are you also looking for partnerships with top pharma firms to try and drive this forward [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1515.28s)]
*  as well? Naturally, we have a platform technology with, we believe, huge potential and much [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1521.6s)]
*  opportunity. And of course, with a small biotech, we can only do so much. We're firmly focused on [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1531.04s)]
*  taking our lead assets and advancing it into the clinic and demonstrating validation of the platform [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1538.32s)]
*  and in parallel, very much open to various flavors of partnerships. We have a pipeline behind the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1545.6s)]
*  lead asset so that partnerships could take various flavors across our entire programs. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1553.04s)]
*  And does all of this seek to just accelerate the rate of change, accelerate the speed that we can [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1560.0s)]
*  take this to market? It's a good question. I think generally what we've seen with cell therapies, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1567.68s)]
*  I think a number of maybe top line headlines with cell therapies. One is that we have nine approvals [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  in this space. So the cell therapy field, whilst being fairly young, has had a number of approvals [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1580.56s)]
*  demonstrating the compelling nature of these types of therapies. But the other interesting point [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  is that many of the therapies, or several at least, have been approved on the basis of relatively [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1592.0s)]
*  few patients, so less than 100 patients. And so it really is the case for these types of therapies [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  that every patient counts. It goes back to my initial point about data generation from [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1605.28s)]
*  relatively few patients can be extremely catalyzing on many levels. And so the commercial [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1612.4s)]
*  path could be fairly accelerated with these types of therapies. You mentioned at Zaluna you'll be [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1620.96s)]
*  hoping to move into the clinic or make an application in the second half of the year. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1627.68s)]
*  What other milestones can we look forward to for Zaluna in the next months and the next years? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1631.92s)]
*  So I think one of the key ones, as we've mentioned, is clinical trial submission and then also getting [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1637.04s)]
*  into the clinic and generating that first data from our lead asset to understand whether what we [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1645.76s)]
*  have seen pre-clinically actually translates into patients. I think alongside that there's [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  an ample opportunity then for potential business development strategies there. One thing to mention [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1657.76s)]
*  around that is we also have quite a, I would say an unprecedented IP position where we have granted [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1669.12s)]
*  patents on the approach, T cell receptor NK approach in its entirety. And so that also creates [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1678.8s)]
*  potential value opportunities through partnerships and other ways. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1687.2s)]
*  You're talking out licensing for other biotechs, other pharma companies? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1693.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think it could take a number of flavors. Out licensing could be one. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1698.3999999999999s)]
*  And are you staying committed to oncology for the moment? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1703.04s)]
*  Yes, at the moment we're focused on oncology. And as I mentioned with our lead asset, we have [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1708.0s)]
*  a number of indications with high unmet need. Across the board, our preliminary assessment is [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1712.72s)]
*  that potentially upwards of 50,000 patients potentially could be eligible across a variety [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1719.68s)]
*  of different indications with the target that we're going after main J4. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1727.44s)]
*  If we can take a step back now and look at the field a little bit more at a global fashion, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1732.4s)]
*  how do you see these TCTR therapies or any of these TCR guided approaches like TCR and K [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1738.24s)]
*  fitting into this broader landscape of cancer treatment? Is this going to become more common [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1744.96s)]
*  with these personalized approaches and cell therapy approaches become more common? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1750.0s)]
*  Yeah, I believe I've been working with T cell receptor based therapies for 15 plus years. And [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1755.44s)]
*  I believe they're poised to be really a major pillar in cancer treatment alongside Checkpoint [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1761.04s)]
*  inhibitors and CAR-Ts, for example. And I think there are two key areas that perhaps will be [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1767.36s)]
*  somewhat the focus. One is moving these T cell receptors away from niche therapies to more [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1774.0s)]
*  broad therapies with more global access or the scalability. And then the second is [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1782.24s)]
*  different ways to address the diversity of cancers. This is the biological problem. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1790.3999999999999s)]
*  And there are a number of strategies to this, for example, combinations, or in our case, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1796.4s)]
*  the TCR and K approach, where we believe we have a way to address diverse cancers. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1803.92s)]
*  Are there speed humps or are there any roadblocks there that need to be overcome, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1811.2s)]
*  regulatory challenges that are in the way? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1816.08s)]
*  I think given how much has been done in the field, there are a number of challenges that have been [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1818.48s)]
*  ironed out from a regulatory perspective. But again, I think the more data we generate, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1826.64s)]
*  we may start to see some changes in the regulations. I think overall, the T cell [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1834.0s)]
*  receptor-based therapies have had a reasonably favorable profile, though the first and earlier [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1841.04s)]
*  therapies that were developed had some toxicity associated with them. And there's been some [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1848.72s)]
*  development in the field in terms of the interrogation of those therapies to avoid those. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1854.08s)]
*  And so far, we've seen that that has had a beneficial outcome in terms of the safety [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1859.76s)]
*  profile of the later therapies. But I think the two areas will really be around scaling [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1865.1999999999998s)]
*  and addressing diverse tumors. So it really sounds like more of a [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1873.1999999999998s)]
*  manufacturing or an operations challenge, more than a scientific challenge right now. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1878.6399999999999s)]
*  I think the scientific challenge is really how to address the diverse cancers. That's really a [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1885.1999999999998s)]
*  biological problem associated with tumors, given their diversity. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1892.48s)]
*  Just as we're finishing up here, Namir, is there something that people should go away with or [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1900.08s)]
*  could go away with, something they can keep in their mind when they're thinking of Zalunar in [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1904.96s)]
*  the next 12 months? Yeah, I think perhaps there are maybe [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1909.44s)]
*  five key things to mention. One is that Zalunar are developing a unique and differentiated TCR [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1916.0s)]
*  NK platform that we believe addresses one of the major challenges of treating solid cancers. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1923.76s)]
*  We're the only ones that are doing it, so that's one. The second is we believe it's a de-risked [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1929.92s)]
*  approach since each of the components, the T cell receptor and NK, have been clinically validated. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1936.16s)]
*  I'm privileged to work with highly experienced team that have walked this path of developing [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1943.0400000000002s)]
*  these types of therapies from discovery through to the clinic. So really great team. That's the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1948.64s)]
*  second. The third is the off-the-shelf allergenic potential and the potential to manufacture [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1954.72s)]
*  hundreds of doses from a single batch. Then the fourth is we have a lead asset with a potential [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1964.88s)]
*  near-term inflection where we're advancing that to the clinic and we believe generating a small [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1971.6s)]
*  set of data will be extremely catalyzing. Finally, under that we have what we believe is a dominant [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1978.7199999999998s)]
*  IP that allows us to operate in this space and protects the entire approach, creating a number of [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1986.8799999999999s)]
*  opportunities from a value perspective. Namir, we're going to look forward to hearing more [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=1995.9199999999998s)]
*  about Zaluna during the year. We wish you very well in the clinic and thank you for joining us [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=2001.12s)]
*  on Beyond Biotech today. Thanks for your time, Vinod. That's it for this episode. Don't forget [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8iYkassCQ&t=2005.04s)]
