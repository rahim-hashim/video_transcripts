# How AI immune system mapping can boost drug discovery
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 86. I'm Jim Connell and this is the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=0.0s)]
*  weekly podcast from LeBioTek. This week we're on the trail of artificial intelligence and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=17.52s)]
*  machine learning with a company that is mapping the immune system to help improve drug discovery. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=24.68s)]
*  The company is ImmunEye and we had a conversation with the company's co-founder and CEO Noam Solomon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=31.4s)]
*  Okay, so I guess the easy first question is if you could tell me a bit about the company. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=40.28s)]
*  Sure, so the name is ImmunEye and it stands for some combination of immunology and AI. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=47.28s)]
*  We started about five and a half years ago with the vision to fully map the immune system with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=55.44s)]
*  the hardcore engineering and AI. You're mapping the immune system and what's the reason for doing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=62.0s)]
*  that I guess initially? Right, so the immune system is really implicated in every health condition [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=70.12s)]
*  our response to therapeutics, how we cope with viral and bacterial infections, how we age. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=77.4s)]
*  We understood early on that if we want to improve the therapeutic development process, we want to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=83.56s)]
*  study the kind of common denominator to all disease which was the immune system. So this was the core [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=90.28s)]
*  reason for that. Often we try and tackle issues without really knowing what comes before it. Is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=95.8s)]
*  it a case of kind of taking one step back to try and fill in the picture before you move forward? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=102.36s)]
*  Exactly, I think that when you study a cancer patient and you study the biopsy of the patient, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=109.24s)]
*  it's already when it's a very late stage, right? If you can study the immune system, you can study [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=117.8s)]
*  it even before the patient had cancer and you can also look at the common denominator because [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=123.72s)]
*  there are similarities and relevance between patients that have melanoma and patients that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=129.96s)]
*  have dermatology autoimmune conditions. They are not similar but they are in some sense maybe [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=135.72s)]
*  opposite. So deciding to study the immune system is allowing us to really look at the root cause [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=141.32s)]
*  analysis for dry disease all over and then we can start figuring out different mechanisms one after [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=148.12s)]
*  another. Is it a very difficult thing to do to be able to map the immune system and would it be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=154.92s)]
*  possible without artificial intelligence? Yeah, when we started, I remember one of the more [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=162.04s)]
*  prominent biotech investors told me that, you know, it sounds great but the immune system is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  infinitely complex. I'm a mathematician and mathematicians love to count things, even [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=173.32s)]
*  infinities. So to me, the immune system was and still is incredibly complex but we believe that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=179.16s)]
*  by mapping the human immune system, by mapping thousands and then tens of thousands and then [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  even millions of patients, we will be able to map the human immune system then apply computational [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=193.0s)]
*  models and AI to try to decode, again, the root cause analysis and figure out the immune intelligence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=197.48s)]
*  that is needed to make better decisions and develop better therapeutics. So the complexity [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=205.48s)]
*  can be matched if we put strong enough compute power and strong enough models to tackle it and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=212.2s)]
*  we are still in the early days of this endeavor. Could you tell me what AMICA, the drug discovery [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=217.88s)]
*  program is? AMICA stands for Annotated Multi-omic Immune Cell Atlas and it stands for the database [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=225.24s)]
*  that we have been building over the past five and a half years and it's kind of the core [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=234.84s)]
*  IP that is driving everything that we do on top of it. So AI or machine learning means nothing if [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=240.52s)]
*  you don't have a database that is large enough and smart enough and clean enough to run complex [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=248.04s)]
*  and expensive models on it. We've been measuring the immune system first from human patients that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  are being treated with immune-modulating drugs for oncology, for autoimmunity and for other [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=262.92s)]
*  immune-mediated diseases. So that means that we are looking into a cohort of patients, could be, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=269.16s)]
*  let's say, 50 or 100 patients, different time points before and after a drug has been administered [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  and we're trying to compare or mine or dissect the differences between responders to the drug [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=280.44s)]
*  and non-responders to the drug or patients that have a toxic event or a side effect. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=287.08s)]
*  We want to understand why. The ability to put contrasting and then leverage computational [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=294.2s)]
*  models to find the features that underscore the difference between the responders and non-responders, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  between toxic events and non-toxic events, between healthy people and disease patients [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=308.36s)]
*  is allowing us over time to better understand how to improve the drug discovery and drug [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=313.0s)]
*  development process. And how are you collating that data? Where is it all coming from? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=318.84s)]
*  It comes from a few different sources. The first source is collaboration. So we work with a large [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=325.56s)]
*  network of academic partners, hospitals all over the world, biotech and biopharma companies that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=331.4s)]
*  are coming to us with their own drugs and they are giving us access to patients in clinical trials. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=337.56s)]
*  So that means that they are giving us the access to the biospecimens, so the biosamples from the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=344.12s)]
*  patients being treated with the drugs. And we are performing our immune profiling, which is taking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=349.08s)]
*  the samples, for example, the peripheral blood samples and then running our processing and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=355.88s)]
*  sequencing that we do in the lab that we have in New York. We generate a lot of data from every [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=362.52s)]
*  patient. We generate thousands of different immune cells and for each cell we generate more than [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=367.88s)]
*  10,000 different genes and hundreds of proteins and other parameters. So it's a large data set [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=376.28s)]
*  even from one patient. We usually take a cohort of patients that are treated with the same drug [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=383.56s)]
*  or similar drugs and we compare them. This is the first type of data. The second type of data [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=388.52s)]
*  is the preclinical work that we do in the lab. So we do a lot of functional genomics work that we [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  do preclinically. In vitro and ex vivo, so work that we do purely in cells. We also do work in vivo, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=398.28s)]
*  so that means in animals, especially in mice. And the third type of data is the data that is published [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=405.64s)]
*  in the public domain. So every time an academic center or university publishes a result in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=412.84s)]
*  peer-reviewed journal like Nature Medicine, the data is being uploaded to the server. We are going [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=418.84s)]
*  to have access to the data. We're going to curate and ingest the data into amica. So these are the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=424.84s)]
*  three sources of the data that keeps feeding amica and keeps growing amica. How does it account for [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=431.0s)]
*  the variability between patients? I mean, there are some diseases where some people will respond [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=437.96s)]
*  to a drug and others don't. And are you able to kind of extrapolate any conclusions from any of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=443.0s)]
*  that? Yeah. So first it's an endeavor of big numbers. If you take the most successful [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  immunotherapy, a PD-1 therapy that has been given for over a decade now, this is a drug that is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  given to patients, start of care for melanoma treated patients, non-small cell anchors, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=465.8s)]
*  and other indications. It doesn't work for anyone. It works for some patients, it doesn't work for [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=471.88s)]
*  others. Our platform is dissecting and analyzing the kind of root cause for why certain patients [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=477.16s)]
*  are responding and others don't. And ideally, we are going to infuse more and more and more data, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=484.68s)]
*  not for one drug, for many drugs. I think about amica as a knowledge sphere, so think about the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=491.08s)]
*  sphere of knowledge that is growing. But in reality, there are a lot of holes in this sphere, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=496.52s)]
*  so maybe more like a Swiss cheese. And over time, we're able to identify the holes or the gaps, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  and then infuse more data to bridge the gaps and close the holes. It's five and a half years [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=509.64s)]
*  in the making, it's probably going to take us another five or 10 years to keep building the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=515.88s)]
*  database and kind of multiply it every year. But as the data grows and the knowledge gaps are closed, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=519.72s)]
*  we're able to find relevant insights that will explain us why certain patients will respond to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  drugs and others won't, and how to find the next generation of therapeutics are going to overcome [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=534.2s)]
*  the resistance mechanisms. What do you see as the biggest challenges currently and the biggest [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=539.24s)]
*  issues facing drug development? Maybe more plainly, I'll take a step back and say that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=545.4s)]
*  to me, the main driver of technology development, or especially in high tech in the past three, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=552.68s)]
*  four decades, was the improvement in compute power. What was framed as Moore's law of engineering, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=558.76s)]
*  that every few years you see doubling of compute power because you can compress more transistors [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=566.04s)]
*  into a specific space. In drug development, you have the opposite law called Ehrens law. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=572.28s)]
*  So over time, with a fixed amount of dollars, you can develop less drugs. And more precisely, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=578.28s)]
*  less drugs are going to get FDA approval. And there are many reasons for that. First, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=586.28s)]
*  there is more competition than there was, let's say, 20 or 30 years ago. There are a lot more [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=591.64s)]
*  approved drugs, and new drugs need to be superior to approved drugs. So before it was a blue ocean, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=597.4s)]
*  now it's not so much a blue ocean. In the US, the regulator is becoming more rigorous. They want to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=603.0s)]
*  see more data convincing the drugs are indeed doing what they're supposed to do. So all of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=609.0s)]
*  these reasons and others are leading to a very poor FDA approval. So I think in oncology, going [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=613.88s)]
*  from a drug candidate that has been IND approved to an FDA approved drug, the statistics is less [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=621.4s)]
*  than 10% success. And I think related to it, the return on investment on a discovered drug [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  is becoming much less compelling, even negative soon. And so that means that pharma companies [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  and biotechnology companies are gradually moving away from investment in drug discovery, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  and they prefer to invest in later stage assets that are already cleared in the phase one and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=648.84s)]
*  phase two. And I think that if this is going to continue and persist this trend, we're going to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=654.6s)]
*  see less innovation, and that's not good for patients. So I hope that with platforms like [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  Immuni, where we are aiming to improve the statistics, to improve the phase one success [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  rate, to improve the phase two success rate, and hopefully it will lead to better ROI's, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=673.64s)]
*  and we're going to see further investments in the early phases, because that's very important to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=678.04s)]
*  invest in innovation and to improve patients' outcome from the beginning. How would you think [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=683.16s)]
*  that artificial intelligence and machine learning will be able to improve drug development? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=688.12s)]
*  So I view AI as part of a bigger issue, which is you want to combine together a few different [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=695.24s)]
*  pieces and stitch them into a platform. In our case, we have a vertically integrated platform [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=704.6s)]
*  that combines together wet lab capabilities, single cell sequencing technologies, functional [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=709.96s)]
*  genomic gene editing capabilities that generate a new type of data modality to profile the immune [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=716.12s)]
*  system. And we generate a new type of data, and we have a lot of engineering infrastructure to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=722.28s)]
*  curate the data, ingest the data, harmonize the data, reduce all the noise in the data. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=729.8s)]
*  And on top of this, you apply more sophisticated AI or machine learning that allow you to mine [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=735.32s)]
*  the data and uncover the immune intelligence. And so I think the vertically integrated nature of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=742.84s)]
*  the platform is very important and not just the AI. But if we're going to go down this development [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=749.64s)]
*  path five, 10 years from now, I strongly believe there is a possibility to significantly improve [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=756.76s)]
*  the statistics of clinical trial design. So that means to improve any clinical trial for a given [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=764.76s)]
*  compound. What is the optimal dose and schedule for the clinical trial? What is the right combination [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=770.92s)]
*  agent to give the drug with? What are the right patient segments to get the drug and others that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=777.4799999999999s)]
*  should not get the drug? And all of these questions can be transformed by the right tools, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=782.92s)]
*  again, vertically integrated tools that combine lab capabilities with computational capabilities. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=788.92s)]
*  On top of this, I think that there is a momentum to start looking at molecules earlier on the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=795.88s)]
*  preclinical stage, analyze how the molecules are interacting with cell-to-cell interactions or [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=804.5999999999999s)]
*  interactions, perturbations in earlier preclinical models in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=811.24s)]
*  and be able to predict or deduce what will happen later in the clinical stages. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=818.44s)]
*  It's still a hope. Nobody was able to do it properly, but I believe that by creating the [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=826.12s)]
*  right data sets and applying the right tools, we are going to see a transformation in this direction. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=833.64s)]
*  As machine learning and artificial intelligence improve, will that speed up the process? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=839.8s)]
*  Yes. And I think what we are seeing in other spaces like text or natural language processing [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=847.16s)]
*  and then video or computer vision, what we see is that if you are able to curate and harmonize [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=856.36s)]
*  large data sets, the new AI models are really able to make a dent in more classical ways to [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=865.16s)]
*  analyze data. I believe the same is going to happen in chemistry, biology, immunology, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=875.0799999999999s)]
*  and the better the models get, the better the statistics will get and we will get better results. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that it's going to apply to pretty much every disease and condition, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=887.0799999999999s)]
*  or do you think that there will be some diseases that are more responsive to the data that you can [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=892.36s)]
*  get through AI? Yeah, it's a great question. First, our approach is to study the immune [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=899.48s)]
*  component of disease. So while most diseases have an immune component, some are really kind of [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  immune mediated, for example, cancer, and others are the immune component is weaker or more [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=912.92s)]
*  confounded by other variables. For our platform, we are trying to target the indications and the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=919.32s)]
*  modalities that are most relevant for the immune system. Of course, there are certain indications [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=927.08s)]
*  where you don't have access to a lot of patient samples because they're more rare, etc. So the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=932.44s)]
*  ability to also have not only immune mediated indications and drugs, but also to have access [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=938.2800000000001s)]
*  to a lot of data is another condition. But I believe that for our platform, the access to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=943.08s)]
*  many patient samples in immune mediated diseases, there is a true potential to unlock [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=948.92s)]
*  important decisions with this platform. There's a lot of people, I guess, working on diseases [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=955.88s)]
*  using artificial intelligence. What is different about yours that sets it apart from others? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=962.52s)]
*  I think immunized approach from the beginning was to concentrate on the immune system first, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=968.8399999999999s)]
*  and I think it's already pretty differentiated. We took a bet on single cell technologies. So we [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=973.8s)]
*  are really mapping every cell separately and not using more older technologies. So really sticking [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=979.9599999999999s)]
*  to the cutting edge technology to profile the immune system, I think it's quite differentiated. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=986.5999999999999s)]
*  We measure the genomics, the proteomics, the epigenomics, so we really go kind of full scale [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  the multimodal profiling. And then as I mentioned earlier, we have the vertically integrated aspect [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=998.28s)]
*  that allows us to combine the wet lab side with the computational side. And on top of all these [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1005.0s)]
*  things, we have been building over the past three, four years, the analytical framework [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1011.56s)]
*  that is called the Immune Dynamics Engine. So it's an engine driven by AI that, like in [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  pharmacology, you study the pharmacodynamics of a drug. We study the immunodynamics of a drug, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1025.56s)]
*  really trying to understand exactly how a drug is impacting the immune system, both in the peripheral [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1030.2s)]
*  immune system and in the disease. And this Immune Dynamics Engine is our secret source and our [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1035.48s)]
*  approach that allows us to really understand how drugs impact patients and also how they impact [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1041.6399999999999s)]
*  mice and other ex vivo and in vitro model systems. As far as we know, we are leading the space of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1048.12s)]
*  immune mediated diseases with this approach. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1056.52s)]
*  You've already received quite a bit of funding. I wonder if you could tell me about some of the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  partnerships that you're developing and I guess how ultimately that will help patients. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1064.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. So I think our investors and our leadership understood that to map the human immune system, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1070.36s)]
*  it's going to take time and it's going to take money. And there was a commitment of [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1076.9199999999998s)]
*  resources to do that. But also we have really great partners. We work with five of the top [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1081.16s)]
*  15 pharma companies and growing. And together we are getting access to the most cutting edge [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1087.72s)]
*  or the next-generation therapeutics and the clinical trials or the preclinical development steps, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1094.92s)]
*  where our platform is being asked to recommend decisions for preclinical and clinical decisions. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1099.8799999999999s)]
*  The access to more cutting edge drugs and to more patient samples is really growing [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1107.16s)]
*  amica and our Immune Dynamics Engine. And so these partnerships I'm very grateful for and [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm very happy to see that more and more partners identify the value that the platform provides. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1120.3600000000001s)]
*  Are companies looking to this for the information that you can provide to them in terms of developing [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1127.0s)]
*  drugs or is it more to fill in the gaps in what's already known? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1134.6s)]
*  I think it's a combination. There are certain decisions that pharma companies and biotechnology [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1141.0s)]
*  companies are making that are very expensive. They are kind of junction. You need to go right or left [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  and as a pharma executive you're going to spend a lot of money and time of your team trying to make [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1151.8s)]
*  a decision. Sometimes they would come to us to support the decision or see if we have concerns. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1157.9599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes it's going to be to maybe a new decision should be kind of brought to bear. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1164.6s)]
*  So I think it's a combination. As I mentioned earlier, we care about improving patient outcomes [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1170.12s)]
*  and we really believe that the platform gets better every time we inform a decision because [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1176.52s)]
*  more data is flowing into amica, more data is being ingested into the Immune Dynamics Engine. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1181.08s)]
*  If some decision was wrong, the algorithm is going to get it better next time. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1189.7199999999998s)]
*  I think there is an iteration or iterative process that every iteration we get slightly [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1194.52s)]
*  better and more data is coming and flowing into the machine. We get better and better. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1199.0s)]
*  I think over time, at least I hope over time, with the statistics being published and readily [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1203.9599999999998s)]
*  available, we are going to really inform decisions end to end. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1210.76s)]
*  I think one of the things that has been clear with the use of AI and machine learning when [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1216.28s)]
*  it comes to drug discovery is it can reduce the number of failures that happen, which are [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1221.88s)]
*  extremely expensive. Are there other ways that you think that it's benefiting? Does [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1228.7600000000002s)]
*  amica, for example, change the timing of clinical trials potentially or does it change [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1234.92s)]
*  the entire model of clinical trials? Right. So first, the decisions that are [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1241.8000000000002s)]
*  being made for clinical trial involve, for example, choosing the optimal dose or choosing [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1248.84s)]
*  the optimal combination agent or choosing the optimal indications to go after. Our platform [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1256.1999999999998s)]
*  can really inform these decisions. For example, if you are trying to develop a drug and you don't [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1261.8s)]
*  know which of the top 10 oncology indications you want to go after, and we tell you, you need to go [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  after those three and ignore the rest of the seven others. If you trust us and we are right, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1273.32s)]
*  we saved you a lot of time in the process, not just money and not just better statistics. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1281.0s)]
*  I think time is really of the essence, probably even more than the money, because the pharma [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1285.96s)]
*  companies, they have the money. If you take them seven years versus four and a half, it can really [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1292.6s)]
*  change the game because they compete with other companies for the same approval. Second, I think [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1298.36s)]
*  that there is also a question of what is the ultimate use of a platform like ours? Is it only [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1305.0s)]
*  to improve clinical trials or can we do other things? And I think we can already inform better [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1311.8s)]
*  decisions from preclinical stages. So if we can look at our platform, we have a lot of data [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1317.8799999999999s)]
*  or similar drugs that have been tested. We can inform a decision, including don't go ahead with [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1324.52s)]
*  this drug for the clinical trial and go with a different one. It's also a very important decision [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1330.04s)]
*  to be made and can save a lot of time and money. And the third aspect, which is still a dream, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1334.52s)]
*  and maybe it's only for 15 years from now, but you asked in the beginning, why do we go after [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1342.44s)]
*  the immune system? And the immune system is kind of the core reason for what we are able to do [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1349.8s)]
*  differently before people are getting sick. If you're able to identify someone before they get [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1356.52s)]
*  cancer, let's say a year before, maybe you can give preventive care. It's going to be much, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1362.68s)]
*  much better. And I think preventive medicine with this approach of immune monitoring patients [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1369.08s)]
*  is really where the platform can add value in the long run. So these are the three aspects, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1374.12s)]
*  improving clinical trials, making better decisions in the preclinical stages for what are the right [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1379.72s)]
*  programs to go after and later also preventive care. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1386.12s)]
*  Do you think that there's more that can be done with AI and preventative care? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1389.8s)]
*  I am intimately convinced that with more data monitoring people, still when they are healthy, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1395.08s)]
*  there is so much to be done about preventive care. It's not just about diagnostics for [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1402.36s)]
*  patients that have early signs of cancer and talking about being able to start identifying [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1407.4799999999998s)]
*  small variants in parameters. Even a year or two or three before people are going to get sick. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1413.1599999999999s)]
*  This is something that I believe will take more time, but it's very much a possibility, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1421.08s)]
*  not only in my mind, I think in many others. It would require a combination of forces of people [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1427.08s)]
*  that would want to make an impact in this direction. The healthcare system should also be [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1433.48s)]
*  tuned into improving the results and the value for people that are insured, for example. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1439.24s)]
*  But in terms of can we identify signals in people's health before they get sick, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1445.8s)]
*  I believe it's only a matter of decision. Technologies evolve very quickly. AI is [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1453.48s)]
*  becoming stronger and faster than before. It's only a matter of time and decision. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1458.4399999999998s)]
*  I guess it's not just a case of being able to see the signs, but also being able to [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1464.6799999999998s)]
*  see what it is that you can do that can prevent those changes occurring? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1472.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I think a few years ago I described what we are doing as Google maps for the immune [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1478.68s)]
*  system. But in Google maps it's not just to say where you are, but also if you want to go from [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1486.28s)]
*  point A to point B. If we have the human immune system and you are in point A and you want to get [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1491.32s)]
*  to point B, if we are able to understand this, we should be able to guide you in the right direction. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1496.36s)]
*  And again, it's still preliminary. I think therapeutics is the most straightforward [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1502.04s)]
*  decision because you go either left or right. Maybe if you are starting to feel maybe a bit [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1506.44s)]
*  dizzy, maybe you don't sleep as well at night, maybe you feel that your results as you are [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1513.0s)]
*  running 10 kilometers are not as great as it was a month ago, and you start monitoring something, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1517.72s)]
*  what are the decisions to be made, change the diet, change... So these are the type of questions that [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1523.8s)]
*  have not been addressed properly. But I think you're absolutely right that this is kind of where [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1529.48s)]
*  the future is going to take us if we want to dedicate time and money to go there. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1535.0s)]
*  And the potential savings by preventing disease are probably exponentially greater than [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1539.64s)]
*  curing people. You're right. But let's say that I'm telling you that by using our platform, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1548.44s)]
*  you're going to remain healthy. The pain that people that are healthy are feeling for staying [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1555.08s)]
*  healthy is not the same of someone who is sick that wants to get better. And this is why I think [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1559.64s)]
*  right now it's also a question of a decision, not a decision of the people that are healthy, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1564.28s)]
*  but a decision of the industry that this is possible and we want to incentivize investments [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1568.84s)]
*  of financing to develop platforms and companies that are going to keep people healthy and prevent [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1574.6s)]
*  them from getting sick. I mean, I know it's difficult to kind of predict, but what do you [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1580.84s)]
*  think will happen in the next year, 18 months, two years with AI and the healthcare system? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1586.04s)]
*  So I think in the next two or three years, we are going to start seeing more success stories. I think [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1595.96s)]
*  the past five years, there was a lot of hope. And then this hope was described as hype because we [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1601.72s)]
*  didn't see a lot of success stories, but I feel that the next three years probably we're going [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  to start seeing success stories. And these success stories are going to, I hope at least, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1611.48s)]
*  are going to create a momentum and a way for more companies to invest in novel therapeutics, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1616.52s)]
*  novel diagnostics and preventive care. I think it's going to be a very interesting decade. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1624.04s)]
*  And what about for specifically for your company? What are the next steps in the next year to two [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1630.68s)]
*  years? We are very committed to making the work that we are doing with our partners successful. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1637.64s)]
*  We really want to demonstrate that our GPS or our platform that can improve patient outcome, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1644.0400000000002s)]
*  first in clinical trials, and then also in preclinical development is successful. And that's [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1652.0400000000002s)]
*  going to be the main use of the platform in the next two years. We have a lot of things that we [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1657.72s)]
*  haven't announced yet, multiple directions all around the immune system and allowing us to [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1662.52s)]
*  demonstrate that the platform can really inform the right decisions and the right recommendations [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1669.08s)]
*  for clinical development and preclinical development. Some areas of technology are [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1674.92s)]
*  developing much more quickly than others and AI is definitely at the forefront, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1684.2s)]
*  constantly changing and rarely out of the news. And clearly it's going to stay that way. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1689.8s)]
*  Definitely many applications in drug discovery to come. Don't forget to check out the latest news [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1695.96s)]
*  and articles at lebiotech.eu and I hope wherever in the world you are you have a great week ahead. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1702.36s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I hope you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOuphCfjoA&t=1709.08s)]
