Video Description: This week, our guest on the podcast is Mark Kotter, founder of newly-created company clock.bio.


clock.bio, a sister company to bit.bio, which Kotter also founded and is the CEO of, aims to extend and improve quality of life by reversing the harmful effects of time in our cells, harnessing the regenerative capabilities of human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).


These hiPSCs have the ability not only to stay young but also to rejuvenate when forced to age.


Clock.bio’s approach is to harness this power of ‘resetting the clock’ in hiPSCs to identify new approaches to treating age-related diseases. It has developed an aging model that ‘force ages’ hiPSCs and triggers their self-rejuvenation mechanism. Unbiased CRISPR screens on large samples of these cells allows for the identification of gene candidates that are causally relevant for cell rejuvenation.


This enables a decoding of rejuvenation biology and corresponding IP; the resulting knowledge will be used to create novel treatment approaches.


The company’s mission is to extend health span by 20 years based on biomarkers of aging in a phase 3 trial by the end of this decade. 


Clock.bio recently published a white paper for rejuvenation therapies (https://mark-kotter.medium.com/a-white-paper-for-rejuvenation-therapies-and-blueprint-for-clock-bio-29a52d375059)  and a blueprint for clock.bio.

# Beyond Biotech podcast 68 – rejuvenation with stem cells
**Beyond Biotech:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0)
*  Hello and welcome to the Beyond Biotech podcast number 68. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jim Cornwall and this is the weekly LeBioTech podcast, and we're winding the clock back [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=14.96s)]
*  a little, not for a repeat, but for a returning guest, which is always a pleasure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=20.48s)]
*  And it's also heartening that they're willing to be on again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=27.58s)]
*  That episode was podcast number 43, and here we are around half a year on in another in-depth [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=30.88s)]
*  conversation with Mark Kotter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=37.86s)]
*  He is the founder and CEO of bit.bio, and now he's also the founder of clock.bio, which [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=40.76s)]
*  is looking to improve the quality of life by using stem cells to treat age-related diseases. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=48.82s)]
*  Now we're not talking about the fountain of youth here, or I'd be first in line, but [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=55.74s)]
*  it's definitely a very interesting conversation and has some exciting possibilities. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=60.5s)]
*  You're already known for your work with bit.bio. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=67.54s)]
*  I wonder if you could tell me about the origins of clock.bio and why that was set up separately? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=71.22s)]
*  So this brings me back to why these companies exist and how my research interests actually [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=79.9s)]
*  evolved in order to span these two companies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  I'm a neurosurgeon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  I've got a special interest in spinal cord injuries. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=92.42s)]
*  There are two types broadly of spinal cord injuries that I treat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  One of them is traumatic. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=100.42s)]
*  So these are the spinal cord injuries after accidents, and they, I felt very strongly, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=102.14000000000001s)]
*  won't benefit from traditional drugs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=108.34s)]
*  They need a cell therapy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=111.26s)]
*  So this is the interest of regenerative medicine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=113.24s)]
*  How do we use cells as medicines? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=116.62s)]
*  And how do we solve some of the bottlenecks in the space of cell therapies, which is really [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=120.38s)]
*  about scale, consistency, and function? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=126.02s)]
*  So I felt that there is an answer to that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=130.94s)]
*  The answer to that really is the basic premise of bit.bio. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=135.18s)]
*  I see another patient population that has what I would call a slow motion spinal cord [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=139.5s)]
*  injury. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=144.54s)]
*  So this is a condition that's called degenerative cervical myelopathy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=145.7s)]
*  This is caused by wear and tear changes in the neck that is pressing on the spinal cord. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  And this induces this kind of slow motion injury. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  Now the interesting thing is, while it's about 90% of us are going to have the degenerative [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=161.42s)]
*  changes in the neck when we reach, let's say, 80 years, only 10% of us are going to get [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=167.5s)]
*  the condition. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  And so the real question on that side is what causes this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And the only answer that we have been able to give so far is age. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=179.82s)]
*  So this is why I was interested in sort of cell therapies and the question of what is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=184.26s)]
*  ageing or what is youth, essentially? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=190.78s)]
*  How do we maintain health? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=192.66s)]
*  From a synthetic biology perspective, these are really the two questions about what are [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=195.78s)]
*  the programs of life? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=201.38s)]
*  If you think about a cell being the result of the activation of programs that are stored [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=202.78s)]
*  in the DNA, the question is, what is the operating system of cells and what are the main [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  programs? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  And I would say one program is the cell identity program, and that's really bit bio. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=216.94000000000003s)]
*  And the other question is the ageing program. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  Now it turns out the cell identity program is a transcriptional program, so transcription [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  factors. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  And if you understand how transcription factors translate into the transcriptional network, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  how they control the programs within a cell, you can leverage that knowledge to create [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=239.58s)]
*  new cell types. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=246.46s)]
*  And so bit bio essentially is providing new products in a very regular sort of cadence [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=247.46s)]
*  now on the research side, and it's using some of these to create clinical medicines. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=254.34s)]
*  On the clock bio side, we don't really quite know what ageing is, but we have seen a consensus [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=260.42s)]
*  that describes ageing as damage on the cellular level across different domains. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  The hallmarks of ageing, that's what it's called. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=276.26s)]
*  So if we don't understand what ageing is, potentially I thought we could understand [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=279.26s)]
*  what youth is. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=285.02s)]
*  And youth seems to be a program that is able to cope with the damage that's accumulating [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=287.3s)]
*  at every moment in time in our cells in the best possible way. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=297.46s)]
*  So you think about entropy that has an effect on all compartments and components of a cell. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=301.74s)]
*  In order to remain youthful, our cells have to be able to deal with these problems and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=308.82s)]
*  repair them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=315.14s)]
*  So in some ways you could say youth is a state of nearly perfect repair. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=316.14s)]
*  Of course, if you do this all the time and perfectly, that is sort of you can live forever, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=324.3s)]
*  and you've seen that in some species. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=329.82s)]
*  Hydra, for example, can do that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  It remains young or healthy forever, unless of course there's trauma or something like that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=334.18s)]
*  And then ageing could be interpreted as a way of switching off these youthful programs, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=341.34s)]
*  these repair mechanisms over time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=351.02s)]
*  And here, of course, the question is, why is this actually occurring? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=353.7s)]
*  We've worked together with the London Institute of Mathematical Sciences to really understand [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=356.7s)]
*  why actually ageing exists, if there's an alternative where it doesn't exist. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=361.46s)]
*  And it also turns out that probably the lead hypothesis of the ageing program is an epigenetic [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=367.7s)]
*  program, not a transcriptional program. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=373.58s)]
*  But it all boils down to information that's stored in the nucleus. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=376.3s)]
*  And that's how these two things fit together scientifically. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=379.96s)]
*  What are the biggest challenges to working in that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  I guess we could call anti-ageing space. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=385.98s)]
*  So, I mean, there's a lot of fluff. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=389.74s)]
*  There's a lot of hype. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=391.86s)]
*  So you just have to keep your head down and be focused on scientific hypothesis that you can trust, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=393.78s)]
*  or at least you think are worthy to pursue. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=402.18s)]
*  That's one of the challenges. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=405.74s)]
*  I'm looking at bit bio and clock bio. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=407.7s)]
*  I personally feel that clock bio is much easier than bit bio. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=410.42s)]
*  When you think about the science. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=415.18s)]
*  But, you know, I'm saying something very heretic here because many people will think the opposite. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=417.38s)]
*  Some of the benefits may seem to be obvious, but what do you see as the benefits in working [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=423.3s)]
*  in this space and helping to prolong life? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  Look, here I'm a medic. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=432.42s)]
*  So my primary ambition isn't to sort of create longevity drugs. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=434.1s)]
*  I'm concerned about patients and treating disease, which is essentially bit bio, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=439.74s)]
*  and preventing disease, which is essentially clock bio. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  So if the consequence of maintaining a youthful state in cells is prolonged lifespan, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=450.14s)]
*  which by the way needs to be proven, then that's fine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=458.18s)]
*  But what I'm concerned as a doctor is health span. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=461.82s)]
*  How can we maintain health the longest possible, really? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=466.58s)]
*  Different parts of the body age differently or at different rates and in different ways. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=470.94s)]
*  How does that play into this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=477.85999999999996s)]
*  This is a hypothesis that I think is a reasonable hypothesis to think that these are different mechanisms. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=479.74s)]
*  But it could just be different vulnerabilities. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  And it could just be that what we call as aging, which is this decline in repair functions of a cell, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=488.62s)]
*  that's how I would sort of define it, affects different cell types differently. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=495.7s)]
*  If it's not the core that's different, but if it's the effect of losing those repair [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=500.62s)]
*  mechanisms that has the effect on cell types and the cell types dictates what the consequence [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=507.06s)]
*  of that is, I think we can still go back to a ground level where we say, if I understand [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=512.7s)]
*  repair processes in cells, I should be able to address various different cell types. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=518.02s)]
*  And how do we make sure that we can do this? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=524.66s)]
*  Obviously, you know, block bio has to validate anything that comes out of the screens in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=527.3s)]
*  multiple cell types and lineages. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  And then we might be able to understand cause effect relationships that are shared and others [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=536.98s)]
*  that are sort of more specific to particular cell types. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=543.5s)]
*  So, for example, a neuron doesn't proliferate. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=546.1s)]
*  So if you have a problem with proliferation, then that's really not a problem for a neuron. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=548.86s)]
*  A neuron needs to maintain health without turning over, you know, as long as we live. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  So probably more focused on maybe things like autophagy or so. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  But autophagy might also play a role in rapidly turning over cell types. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=564.38s)]
*  So it's yes and no. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=569.1800000000001s)]
*  I think we need to understand that there are different vulnerabilities and these lead to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=570.1800000000001s)]
*  different symptoms or diseases. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=576.4200000000001s)]
*  But ultimately, the core mechanism for me, my hypothesis is the same. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=579.5799999999999s)]
*  It's a shared mechanism that somehow leads to different kinds of failure across different [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=585.26s)]
*  cell types. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=590.54s)]
*  How do you plan on addressing that in terms of treatment? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=591.54s)]
*  So in terms of the discovery process, I'll start with that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=596.18s)]
*  Block bio is trying to find out all repair mechanisms that exist in human cells that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  can address the hallmarks of aging. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=607.9s)]
*  That's the first part of the screen. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=610.66s)]
*  The validation, of course, then happens in multiple cell types. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=612.66s)]
*  So we'll find out which cell types are more affected and where these repair mechanisms [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=617.34s)]
*  play a more important role. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=623.06s)]
*  The next step would be then to link diseases, age related diseases, with some of these repair [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=625.98s)]
*  mechanisms and genes. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=633.14s)]
*  And I've hinted to that a little bit. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=635.42s)]
*  Dementia, for example, we know that autophagy might play an important role. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=637.66s)]
*  What are the genes that regulate autophagy in a cell? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=643.34s)]
*  That's what we're going to find out in our first screen. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=646.34s)]
*  If you think about skin, for example, is an organ that turns over. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=649.98s)]
*  So it's stem cells in essence that probably plays an important role. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=654.22s)]
*  Diabetes, it's nutrient sensing pathways that might play a role. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=659.78s)]
*  So we can then deconstruct and deconvolute the cause and effect relationship between [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=664.26s)]
*  the repair genes or the set of repair programs that we have in the different cell types in [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=669.26s)]
*  relation to age related conditions. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=674.74s)]
*  And that would allow people then to create drugs that target these repair mechanisms [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=677.62s)]
*  that are disease specific. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=683.98s)]
*  Now, if you think about rejuvenation or maintaining health span longer, you probably have to target [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=686.4200000000001s)]
*  multiple of these aging hallmarks, ideally all of the aging hallmarks. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=694.7s)]
*  But again, the data sets that we're generating should allow you to do this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=699.94s)]
*  And then you have to find a rational way of combining probably a few drugs that are able [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=703.52s)]
*  to switch on the different repair mechanisms that you require to maintain a state of better [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  or perfect homeostasis. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=717.86s)]
*  So this is how I look at it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  Now there will be probably drug combinations that can generally support cell health. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=721.46s)]
*  And then there'll be pathways or drugs or combination that are better suited when you [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=731.1s)]
*  already have a disease that is affected by certain aging hallmark that you then have [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  to boost more than others. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=743.26s)]
*  So conceptionally, I hope that makes sense. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=745.38s)]
*  It's not a one size fits all treatment that cures everything you'll need to, I assume, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=749.5s)]
*  as you were saying, develop different treatments for different conditions. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=756.1s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=761.34s)]
*  Interestingly, if you look at cross tissues, we already know that they age at different [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=762.34s)]
*  pace. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=767.02s)]
*  For example, ovaries age very fast versus, let's say, brain cells that actually age, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=768.02s)]
*  I mean, especially neurons that age relatively slow. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=774.1800000000001s)]
*  And the brain, I think the stem cell compartment ages faster than the neurons. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  So we have to take this into account. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=783.98s)]
*  And there's another sort of thing that I thought about when you mentioned the synchronicity [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=786.46s)]
*  across the organism. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=791.22s)]
*  We now have learned that the extracellular matrix properties have an influence on the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=793.1800000000001s)]
*  cells. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=799.26s)]
*  And that might be a way of synchronizing across different cell types and across different [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  cells. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=806.02s)]
*  And we already also know from interesting data that suggests that there is something [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=807.02s)]
*  like chronokines or agents that sort of spread age across the organism. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=811.46s)]
*  So obviously, only looking at the cell alone, probably not sufficient. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=819.06s)]
*  And we have to take in that broader context. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=827.54s)]
*  And this is why I said, look, I think extending health span is going to be an easier task [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=830.5s)]
*  than extending lifespan. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=836.9s)]
*  And quite frankly, as a medic, I'm really focused on health span. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=839.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=842.54s)]
*  Could you tell me a little bit about, you mentioned stem cells. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=843.54s)]
*  Could you tell me about stem cells and the relevance of that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=846.78s)]
*  I believe these are the key. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=851.06s)]
*  I mean, they're the key for both. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=853.06s)]
*  For BitBio, which is essentially creating cell types. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=854.9s)]
*  And I think everyone agrees with that because that's been the promise of stem cells and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=858.1s)]
*  regenerative medicine. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=863.02s)]
*  But we don't need them to be stem cells. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=865.36s)]
*  We need the stem cells to be the source of the cell types that you require in order to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=867.9399999999999s)]
*  treat the conditions that you want to treat. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=873.5799999999999s)]
*  So it's really just the starting point. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=876.1s)]
*  On the other hand, when you look at the clockpire paradigm, stem cells are thought to be in [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=879.0600000000001s)]
*  a state, what I would call a perfect homeostasis. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=886.34s)]
*  So the dogma was that proprotein stem cells don't age. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  We asked the question, if they're youthful, what's youth? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=895.72s)]
*  And we talked about youth being a dynamic state. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=900.02s)]
*  If it's a dynamic state, like anything in biology, we should be able to push them outside [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=904.14s)]
*  of the boundaries of what they can cope with. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=909.58s)]
*  So we thought we should be able to find an intervention where we can induce some of the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=912.74s)]
*  aging hallmarks in proprotein stem cells. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=920.42s)]
*  And that's exactly what we found. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=924.3s)]
*  We found a paradigm, what we call an aging intervention, where we can push these proprotein [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=925.9s)]
*  stem cells into an aging phenotype. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's extraordinary. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=935.14s)]
*  Every aging hallmark that we were interested in can be reproduced and can appear in a pluripotent [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=937.38s)]
*  stem cell, which is what nobody expected. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=942.82s)]
*  And what we then found was that if you stop this aging intervention, the aging pressure, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=946.1s)]
*  actually the cells repair and they go back to a healthy state. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=952.34s)]
*  And what that taught us is that stem cells have the capability to compensate all these [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=956.9s)]
*  changes, the entire entropy that sort of causes damage at all levels of these aging hallmarks. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=964.34s)]
*  So they hold the key for us to teasing out those rejuvenation biology elements. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=972.18s)]
*  That's one point I wanted to make. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=981.02s)]
*  The other point that I wanted to make is that stem cells have to have that ability, because [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=982.74s)]
*  if they wouldn't have that ability, we wouldn't exist. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=989.38s)]
*  So if you think about it, if stem cells weren't what we could call age ground zero, not my [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=993.02s)]
*  terms that was recently introduced, what would happen is that we'd pass on our age or a fraction [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1001.78s)]
*  of our age to the next generation and so on. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1010.58s)]
*  And that would lead to an extinction event. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1014.62s)]
*  The only way of maintaining a species is if your germ cell derives stem cells, which are [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1017.34s)]
*  the origin of your organism, are young. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1022.9000000000001s)]
*  Now it makes sense that if you induce Yamanaka factors and you reprogram a fibroblast, say, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1028.02s)]
*  cell, the fibroblast turns young again, because that's what's foundationally important for [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1036.26s)]
*  a pluripotent stem cell stage. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1042.1s)]
*  And there's been publications looking at that, taking skin cells from centenarians, doing [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1044.26s)]
*  Yamanaka reprogramming and demonstrating that during that process, youth is restored. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1051.22s)]
*  And if you then take the stem cell and you differentiate that back into a fibroblast [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1057.54s)]
*  so the same cell type, you can see the original one from a 100 year old donor, the one that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1061.34s)]
*  has been produced from the pluripotent stem cell is fetal, is young again. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1067.46s)]
*  So that's the conceptual framework that I think ties everything together. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1072.98s)]
*  How would you then, I guess, apply that to helping the patient? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1077.1s)]
*  What we think we're seeing in ClockBio as we do these screens for rejuvenation programs, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1082.66s)]
*  re-repair programs. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1090.26s)]
*  And the cool thing is the data is extremely crisp. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1092.02s)]
*  There's no cell change, so partial reprogramming paradigms where people try and tease out the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1096.02s)]
*  reprogramming phase from the rejuvenation phase. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1102.02s)]
*  This is very difficult because the main driver is the cell identity change. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1106.06s)]
*  In our paradigm, it's the stem cell, it doesn't change its identity, it gets old and it gets [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1110.7s)]
*  young again. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1116.1s)]
*  So we can really sort of tease out the genes that are involved in these repair processes. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1117.18s)]
*  Once we have a full picture of all genes that are involved in the various different repair [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1123.98s)]
*  processes that address the hallmarks of aging, we can then make rational choices about how [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1129.54s)]
*  we target these genes or these programs using ideally small molecules if it comes to a health [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1136.98s)]
*  and extending treatment because we need to be aware of price and we want to ideally use [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1144.8600000000001s)]
*  a repurposed drug as long as possible and if it's possible. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1149.94s)]
*  But the essence is that we have to translate what we find, these repair modulating genes [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1154.1000000000001s)]
*  and targets to treatments that are relevant for whatever you want to treat. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1164.78s)]
*  We talked about the different age-related conditions and of course also if you sum them [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1169.5s)]
*  up essentially that might be a generic health span extending treatment. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1174.94s)]
*  Small molecules is the short answer ideally. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1180.78s)]
*  Where are you at currently? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1184.46s)]
*  Clearly it's a field that still has a lot of research being done. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1186.9s)]
*  So are you doing sort of research and looking towards doing clinical trials? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1190.9s)]
*  Bit.bio is essentially the idea of repairing the damage. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1198.3799999999999s)]
*  It's going into clinical trials in 2025. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1202.7s)]
*  Clock.bio is hyper-focused at the moment at the discovery stage. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1206.06s)]
*  We hope that we know all rejuvenation programs in the next few months and we then are going [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1211.5s)]
*  to go and validate them very, very structured in a very dispassionate way to then be able [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1218.3799999999999s)]
*  to draw those associations between aging hallmarks, targets and diseases. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1226.06s)]
*  And what we've already done is we've proven the concept of the screen. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1235.02s)]
*  So we've done in our first pilot is only about 1000 genes that we've perturbed. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1240.06s)]
*  We immediately found targets of pathways that we felt were interesting. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1245.98s)]
*  We then were able to find drugs and we were able to show that in an aged neuron, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1251.82s)]
*  if you have drugs that are able to modulate those targets, you can restore health or you can [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1258.86s)]
*  rejuvenate certain aspects of the cell. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1266.3s)]
*  So I'm going to go a little bit more into detail right now. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1268.86s)]
*  So the way that we discover rejuvenation biology is by assessing the age of the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1272.4599999999998s)]
*  peripotent stem cells and their ability to reverse the age once the aging intervention is stopped. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1279.26s)]
*  And we do this using what you could call a transcriptomic clock. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1287.58s)]
*  So a transcriptional profile that allows you to measure the age of that individual cell. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1291.98s)]
*  This is how we identify target genes because if you knock that out and the cell can't reverse [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1297.82s)]
*  its age and you can see that in the transcriptomic profile, then that's a hit, for example. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1302.62s)]
*  And what we then did was we took that hit, that target gene, went into a neuron and tried to [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1309.9799999999998s)]
*  assess an aging hallmark that is remote from the transcriptomic profile. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1319.4199999999998s)]
*  So if you think about most of the things happen in the nucleus, whether it's epigenetic changes [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1324.3799999999999s)]
*  or whether it's DNA double strand breaks, then there is changes that happen in the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1328.94s)]
*  cytoplasm, nutrient sensing pathways, intracellular and intracellular signaling. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1333.98s)]
*  And then there's the mitochondria, which is like a different entity or a distinct entity in the cell. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1339.18s)]
*  So we wanted to see whether our transcriptomic clock would allow us to identify targets [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1344.54s)]
*  that would have a positive effect on the mitochondria. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1351.66s)]
*  We just thought this would be a stretch and as far as we could challenge the system. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1354.3s)]
*  And so the readouts that we focused on was really on mitochondrial health and function. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1359.82s)]
*  And the extraordinary thing is actually even with a small pilot that we've done initially, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1366.1399999999999s)]
*  we already found multiple drugs that are able to restore mitochondrial function in aged cell types. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1370.62s)]
*  And not only that, we were able to find pathways that increase autophagy, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1377.6599999999999s)]
*  mitochondrial presence, et cetera. So I'm quite confident now that this approach works. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1383.1s)]
*  Whether it works in every instance, we don't know yet. I mean, that's why we really want to [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1389.1799999999998s)]
*  be very systematic about evaluating the target genes that we're identifying. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1395.02s)]
*  So obviously early stage yet, but clearly cost is always a huge issue when it comes to [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1400.4599999999998s)]
*  treatments. Is that something that you're factoring in at this stage? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1407.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, very much so. So again, one of the things that has driven me to create BitBio [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1411.9s)]
*  was that I felt cell therapies, they are revolutionary, but the costs and the price [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1419.58s)]
*  point are much too high. In fact, at the moment, the cost of goods over cell therapy is so high [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1425.18s)]
*  that most companies that create cell therapies make losses when they sell it to the providers. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1430.22s)]
*  It's kind of bad business model, isn't it? If you have a treatment that costs [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1435.1s)]
*  more to produce than you actually can charge, but that's the reality for many cell therapies. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1438.7s)]
*  So BitBio, we thought we could lower the cost of goods by two orders of magnitude. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1444.38s)]
*  And this has two consequences. Number one, of course, this is how you build a business, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1449.66s)]
*  but number two, you can drop the price so that more people can benefit from a revolutionary [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1453.74s)]
*  treatment because at the moment we're stuck with end-stage cancer in blood in certain patient [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1460.06s)]
*  populations. But a curative treatment should be available at the onset, not at the end after [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1465.26s)]
*  you've gone through chemotherapy, radiotherapy, et cetera. So it is absolutely necessary to reduce [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1470.86s)]
*  the cost of goods and to democratize access to human cells. On the other hand, if it comes to [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1476.7s)]
*  treatments that affect healthspan, I think it's even more foundationally important that people [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1483.66s)]
*  have access to that. I would hope that everyone agrees with that. There shouldn't be a class [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1490.06s)]
*  just because they're privileged that can access such treatments whereas others aren't able to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1497.4199999999998s)]
*  access this. So this idea of democratizing access to new treatments is really very important to [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1503.8999999999999s)]
*  And this is why our main drive is to identify drugs that are already out there that we can [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1511.8999999999999s)]
*  use to influence these aging hallmarks and ideally to repurpose them. So my hope at this point in time [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1522.06s)]
*  is that we still can find drug combinations that have this effect based on drugs that already [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1529.8999999999999s)]
*  exist that are already in the clinic that are safe because of course it's another question, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1536.94s)]
*  safety is really important if you work on healthspan. If you work on fixing a disease, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1541.5s)]
*  you can take much higher risks than if you work on making sure that we remain healthy along a [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1547.74s)]
*  period of time. So access is critical. Are you currently looking for partners, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1554.22s)]
*  fundraising or is that ongoing? I mean, Biotech is always looking for partners and fundraising. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1561.26s)]
*  You've seen BitBio entering partnerships, you're going to see hopefully ClockBio either entering [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1567.98s)]
*  partnerships and or fundraising. So this is the nature of the game until you get to a stage where [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1573.82s)]
*  you have revenue from products that you've generated. So yes, please come to us if you want to. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1580.22s)]
*  You're still working on all of this and it's a evolves all of the time. Obviously you're [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1587.3400000000001s)]
*  hopeful that this is going to lead to some major breakthroughs. What kind of timescales are you [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1592.94s)]
*  looking at? BitBio, we should be in the clinic in 2025. With some luck, we should have an answer [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1600.8600000000001s)]
*  whether the first treatment is working within 12 months and then hopefully we're not very far away [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1607.3400000000001s)]
*  from a registration. It's still long but in the time scale of drug discovery and development, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1614.3s)]
*  it's actually okay. I can wait for it. I've had this idea years ago. We are closer than ever [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1621.34s)]
*  to making a difference. So I'll stick it out. And then on the clock side, I would say, you don't know [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1629.34s)]
*  because you find a drug that works in a certain context or a combination of drugs, you can go to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1637.34s)]
*  the clinic immediately. I've been involved and I lead a clinical trial of a drug that I thought [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1643.26s)]
*  would be very interesting in the context of DCM. And it's essentially a phase 2b3 trial from the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1649.1s)]
*  onset onwards because it's a repurposed drug. You don't have to go to phase one, phase two if the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1656.3s)]
*  drug's safe. So you don't know. I mean, the crazy thing that we said in ClockBio is we want to make [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1660.78s)]
*  a difference by the end of the decade by showing based on a biomarker that we have a rejuvenating [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1666.62s)]
*  therapy. Now that sounds outrageous, but I just want to submit that there has already been a trial [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1674.3s)]
*  that used a drug combination that showed that you can reduce an epigenetic clock in a handful of [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1682.06s)]
*  men that are over 50, which now I count as well, but I've not been involved, of course. But I think [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1689.5s)]
*  it's a bold aim for ClockBio, but actually I think it's achievable. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1697.1s)]
*  That's very good news for hopefully lots of people because of the nature of what you do [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1702.86s)]
*  and your background. Clearly the end patient is very uppermost in your mind. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1707.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is what I live for. I mean, I have dedicated my life to this and I feel [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1714.3s)]
*  it was very hard at the beginning and I feel very privileged at the same time [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1720.86s)]
*  that I'm in a position where I can actually live my dream. It's still hard and it's a bumpy road, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1725.74s)]
*  but it's a real privilege to be able to do that. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1733.26s)]
*  So definitely another really fascinating and thought provoking conversation there. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1741.42s)]
*  And by my reckoning, it means we should be chatting with Mark again in April [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1746.86s)]
*  if we follow the same frequency of having him on the podcast. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1751.66s)]
*  And a quick reminder to check out the latest news and articles at lebiotech.eu [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1756.22s)]
*  and I hope wherever in the world you are, you have a great week ahead. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1762.0600000000002s)]
*  Thanks for listening and you'll join us again next time for another Beyond Biotech. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXfk3efr8F0&t=1765.74s)]
