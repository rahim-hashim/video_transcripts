# The power of partnership â€“ Prometheus Biosciences
**The RTW Podcast:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8)
*  Welcome to the RTW podcast. I'm Josh Baldwin, Managing Director of Communications at RTW. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=0.0s)]
*  For this episode, I'm joined by my colleague, Josh Kennedy-Smith, Managing Director Research [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Analyst at RTW. And we'll be speaking with Mark McKenna, Chairman and CEO of Prometheus [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=13.96s)]
*  Biosciences. In this conversation, we'll explore Mark's background in the story of Prometheus, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=19.68s)]
*  his recent acquisition by Merck, and the relationship between a CEO and investor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=24.68s)]
*  Hope you enjoy the conversation. Welcome. Thank you, Mark, for being here. Appreciate [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=29.88s)]
*  it. My pleasure. Glad to be here. Josh, thank you for co-hosting with me generously. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=36.64s)]
*  Of course. So we've got a bunch of things that I'd love to talk to you about. I think [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=41.08s)]
*  maybe we start out with your career, get a little bit of your background, and sort of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=46.28s)]
*  understand how you came to be where you are. Yeah, sure. Again, thanks for hosting. Josh, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=50.88s)]
*  great to be with you again. So again, Mark McKenna, Chairman and CEO of Prometheus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=56.68s)]
*  I spent a better part of 20 years in healthcare and started with Johnson & Johnson in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=61.0s)]
*  device world, worked with Bausch & Lomb for over a decade. My last position there was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=69.48s)]
*  running the US franchise. And then I had a unique opportunity to pivot over to Pharma, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=74.76s)]
*  where I ran a company called Salix Pharmaceuticals. And then that wasn't enough transition and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=80.4s)]
*  change from consumer health device to Pharma. I got a phone call from a guy named Tachi [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Yamada who passed away a few years ago, who was a friend and mentor. And he said, hey, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=91.64s)]
*  I want you to take a look at this platform and this early technology out of Cedars-Sinai. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=97.04s)]
*  And my first instinct was, well, I'm not a pre-clinical guy. I'm running a $2 billion [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  business. I had other aspirations, but the more and more work I did on this, the more and more [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=107.96s)]
*  conviction I had. And not only did I want to actually invest in this personally, but invest [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=112.08s)]
*  my time. And yes, we burned the boats and moved to San Diego for what was a pretty remarkable [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=116.08s)]
*  journey, but pretty humble beginnings that I'm sure we'll get into today. Yeah. So what was that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=123.36s)]
*  transition like? Talk a little bit about sort of going from the big Pharma, big company, lots of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=128.88s)]
*  resources to a startup, essentially. I think if you were to ask a lot of people that I work with, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=135.56s)]
*  I think that the homework of my career has been able to, learning agility and just asking questions [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=141.16s)]
*  to better understand, putting yourself out there. That's when you grow and learn the most. And [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=147.56s)]
*  having had the experience going from consumer health to device to Pharma, I had a really good [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=152.76s)]
*  backbone around how the business operates. There's some nuance to Pharma that's different than [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=160.4s)]
*  device, but some of the business principles are the same. Pre-clinical is very technical. And I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  knew that if I was going to be talking to investors, I had to know it as well as my scientist. And so [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=171.24s)]
*  the job one is getting up to speed and understanding all the nuance that goes into the business from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=175.56s)]
*  the assays that are needed to submit for your approval with the FDA to the clinical strategy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=183.08s)]
*  And even if you don't have every element of it covered, you know the right questions to ask to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=189.2s)]
*  get to the most important aspects of it. So look, I think that this was an incredible opportunity [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=194.32s)]
*  that I just kind of felt that a lot of patients could benefit from this technology. IBD is a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=201.84s)]
*  heterogeneous disease, 5 million people globally. And unfortunately, a lot of patients are getting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=208.16s)]
*  suboptimal care today. And we believed at Prometheus that this was the best hope for those patients. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  And so it was partly with that conviction of addressing that unmet need. And then secondly, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=219.72s)]
*  the business opportunity of really creating substantial shareholder value. When I first got [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  there in mid 2019, it was a $50 million company. That was the valuation. And there was a lot of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=229.88s)]
*  other nuance to the business with regard to it had a diagnostic business, a commercial stage, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=236.2s)]
*  LDT commercial business. And then it had this great technology on the therapeutic side with a novel [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=241.44s)]
*  target and data that would allow us to build out a portfolio of programs throughout I&I. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=247.68s)]
*  But the early days were pretty challenging. When I first got there, we thought there was about 18 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=255.12s)]
*  months worth of capital. It turned out there's about seven or eight. And I remember going into [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=259.92s)]
*  my CFO's office at the time and saying to her, what happens if we can't raise the funds? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=266.32s)]
*  It may seem like self-evident now, but in the moment it was like, okay, what are the options? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  And she was very matter of fact, she's like, well, we'll just file this bankruptcy form. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=279.0s)]
*  We'll start laying people off. We'll shut it down. I was like, wow. I was like, that is not a good [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=285.32s)]
*  option. What does Plan B look like? And look, there's a lot of amazing things to the science [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=290.12s)]
*  here. The business model needed some work. And one of the things that was a challenge is that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=296.44s)]
*  we didn't have any professional investors. It was a Cedars-Sinai spin out. And so it took some time [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=300.52s)]
*  for folks to understand the opportunity. What is the right business model? Given that we had the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  diagnostic side and the therapeutic side, we get greater clarity as we advanced. And Cedars-Sinai [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=312.84s)]
*  was a unique bet for them. It obviously paid off in a big way, $1.3 billion. But they had to double [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=320.76s)]
*  down. And I remember driving up to Los Angeles and having dinner with their CFO and saying, look, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=327.32s)]
*  here's what I think we can do. I'm more convinced of it than ever before, but we need more time to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=332.36s)]
*  be able to advance the science, advance the programs, and attract the right investors. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=338.68s)]
*  We had at the time term sheets from other investors. They just weren't attractive. And [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=344.36s)]
*  we were on the cusp of a couple of different milestones that were forthcoming that would [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=349.64s)]
*  provide greater clarity to the business model as well as de-risk the program a bit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=353.48s)]
*  And so that was the journey. And up into that point, it was 24 people on the therapeutic side, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=357.88s)]
*  all punching above their weight, rolling up sleeves, and believing in the greater good that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=366.36s)]
*  we could create here. And then a few investors saw the opportunity of what we were building. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  So can you talk a little bit about that? Because I'm curious about, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=375.88000000000005s)]
*  so you're going from big pharma device in big companies where you were not involved, I imagine, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=380.36s)]
*  in investor communications or raising money in any way. And getting in and that being a big part of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=388.12s)]
*  the job, I would imagine, what was that like? Yeah, I had pretty good visibility and exposure to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  the IR side. I ran the biggest business at Bouch Health and Salix. It was a $2 billion franchise. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=404.36s)]
*  So I spoke at various debt conferences. I interacted with investors there, but it's a [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=410.44s)]
*  different phenotype than the biotech investor. And in terms of raising capital, no, this was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=414.76s)]
*  the first time I had an opportunity to do that. And it was much more challenging than I thought, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=417.96s)]
*  partly because of COVID, partly because of the fact that the business model wasn't ready. And [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=423.32s)]
*  it took the right investor to see the opportunity to really maximize this. And with any novel [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=428.6s)]
*  science, there is inherent risk. It's very easy to make a bet on the fifth MOA. The upside is not [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  as high. But I think that that's where you've got to combine from the other side of the table, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=444.28000000000003s)]
*  the investor has got to have the right science and they have to have the right understanding of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  what's going to take to make this commercially viable. And I think that that's where I see a big [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=453.72s)]
*  difference in the market with a lot of investors is that some of them really are methodical and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=457.64s)]
*  really deep on the science, but they miss out on what could be. And then what limitations are [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=463.0s)]
*  you going to face as you go to try and get reimbursement? So putting the pieces of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=469.24s)]
*  puzzle together, I think is really important. You can't just do one. And the other thing I would [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=472.76s)]
*  say is that over and over again, what I've heard from investors is that the value that we place on [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=477.24s)]
*  the team has exponentially gone up based upon your story and other stories based upon the fact that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=481.72s)]
*  great science only comes to light with the right people executing against it. And so I think that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=488.6s)]
*  you've got to have confidence in the people that you're investing in. And so it's the science, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=494.76000000000005s)]
*  it's the business model and it's the team. Yeah. So maybe this is a good opportunity to get [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=498.6s)]
*  Josh in here. Josh, can you talk a little bit about the early days of how did this come across [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=503.16s)]
*  your plate, the opportunity with Prometheus and what was that sort of exploration like? What were [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=510.92s)]
*  you looking for? What did you see? Yeah, it's funny. I went back in my notes today and I looked up the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=518.76s)]
*  date of our first meeting and it was May 12th, 2020. So I was in the dead of that first kind of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=524.2s)]
*  wave of COVID where everyone was still pretty probably in shock. And so I just want to tell [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  one anecdote which is one that always sticks with me is at that point in time we had a six month [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=538.36s)]
*  old essentially and we were fighting our way through this by ourselves as two parents. I was [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=547.08s)]
*  pretty disheveled and like, you know, I'd wake up, I just basically like put on some pajamas and sit [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=551.88s)]
*  down and I would work at a laptop that was basically set up on a card table. And so I get [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=559.24s)]
*  this introduction. I'm like, okay, I'm going to meet with Prometheus and you get a little [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=565.0s)]
*  bit of background on the story, but you don't really know what you're getting into. And along [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=570.12s)]
*  comes Mark onto the screen. I was like, wow, this dude is really put together. He looks great. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=573.48s)]
*  I'm sitting there, I'm like embarrassed. I have like a, you know, like a castaway beard and like [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=580.68s)]
*  I haven't had a haircut in months. But no, in all seriousness, I think, you know, the first [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=586.2s)]
*  impressions of the company really were they were able to tell a very kind of or even not even tell [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=593.16s)]
*  but like ask a provocative question, which is in IBD, like, how are we going to make a step change, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=598.28s)]
*  some kind of quantum leap and Mark like in looking at my notes, that the story that they were telling [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  is ultimately what was delivered, right? Three years later. And so there's obviously a lot that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=611.56s)]
*  happened in between there. But I think where we started was was just basically saying, here's, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=617.72s)]
*  you know, some science that is interesting, the thesis that they have, which kind of became our [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=622.8399999999999s)]
*  thesis as well, was one again, it was this question they're asking, like, how do we, you know, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=629.16s)]
*  how do we improve things way beyond where standard of care is? And so when you're interacting with [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=634.52s)]
*  teams, and they're telling you that, and they're just saying that, that's one thing. But there was [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=640.68s)]
*  like a roadmap that was kind of painted for us that says, here's a target where there's some [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=645.16s)]
*  clinical validation. And then behind that, there's all this genetic evidence. And so as Mark was [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=650.44s)]
*  kind of alluding to, there was multiple parts of the business. And so it became super interesting [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=655.72s)]
*  in that respect, because it was it was something that looked and felt different at the time. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  It was something that you weren't used to seeing when you were approached by an immunology company, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=666.12s)]
*  or you were pitched in an immunology company, it just it felt different. And that that's the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=670.7600000000001s)]
*  one thing that going from from that time point in May until we we close the crossover later in the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=675.8s)]
*  fall, where you were able to kind of hold on to that and work down that path of saying like, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=681.88s)]
*  like, I know that there's something special here, and I just have to go and do the work now to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=688.5999999999999s)]
*  unpack all of it so that we can get more confident and we can believe that again, in the story that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=692.76s)]
*  they're telling, and that they're going to be able to execute on it. Yeah. So so you mentioned we [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=698.28s)]
*  came in at the crossover round, and we invested again at the IPO. And then there was a big phase [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=704.12s)]
*  two data readout late last year, all opportunities where we could have gotten out, we could have made [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=710.44s)]
*  a good deal of money and been out. Looking back, it's obvious why we did that is a great move. But [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=718.92s)]
*  at the time, there's there's probably that question that comes up. And I'm sure a lot of other [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=727.4s)]
*  investors would have maybe taken that guaranteed check and say goodbye. Some did. And I think Mark [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=733.56s)]
*  can probably speak to this better than I can. Like this story is not a perfect one, right? So it [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=741.56s)]
*  wasn't even though if you like reflect on it, you look at like the stock chart, it almost looks like [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=746.28s)]
*  it's a straight line up. But there were points, even last year where things got choppy. And that's [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=751.56s)]
*  not that wasn't their fault. That was the market. And then it was Pfizer. There were so many people [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  that were kind of paying attention to the Prometheus story. But to do that, you had to pay attention [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=762.68s)]
*  to the landscape. And we had this competitor that was out there talking about the program. And that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=768.68s)]
*  benefited them immensely. But it also probably the greatest pain that we all saw as investors [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=774.12s)]
*  was a moment in time kind of in the early part of 2022, where people were just unsure if if all the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=780.28s)]
*  commentary that was being made by the senior management at Pfizer was aligning with what [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=787.64s)]
*  some of the less senior people were saying. And there were points of time where it was a little [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=792.2s)]
*  scarier. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I think that every firm has their own risk tolerance. And I think that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=796.6s)]
*  one of the biggest challenges to this story is that, you know, the stock was moving in the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=804.12s)]
*  right direction to your point. Yeah, there was gains to be had. And depending on macro factors [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=808.76s)]
*  of the funds in the market, certain investors had to make certain decisions. I think that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=815.08s)]
*  Josh didn't stay with us blindly. It was a thoughtful decision with him and Rod and others [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=821.8s)]
*  and the team that said, look, they've outlined a playbook, they've executed against that playbook, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=828.92s)]
*  and the science continues to deliver. And I think one of the hardest things in this space is finding [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=833.56s)]
*  companies like this that are novel, that have, you know, opportunity to be 10 billion or more. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=841.24s)]
*  There's just not a ton of them out there. And so, yes, you can go take, you know, a 5X return on [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=847.0s)]
*  your investment pretty quickly following the IPO. But the other aspect is RTW was really helpful [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=853.48s)]
*  in help with the strategy to the extent that you can do that as a public company. You know, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=861.0s)]
*  have you thought about this or that? You know, have you seen what this other company is doing here? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=865.8s)]
*  You know, how are you thinking about setting expectations with investors? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=870.52s)]
*  All these types of things, I mean, that's what you're looking for. There's plenty of capital out [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=874.52s)]
*  there. What was different though that I saw with our relationship is one, the early bet, both RTW [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=878.0400000000001s)]
*  and Joy Gosh saw the opportunity together. You know, we were able to build a really incredible [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=884.52s)]
*  syndicate that by and large all stood by us. We had incredible investors in that crossover. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=890.2s)]
*  Cormorant, you know, 0.72, Cowan, Perceptive, but it took the courage of, you know, RTW and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=896.36s)]
*  one other investor to really say, hey, we're going to put pen and paper, we're going to put an X out [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  there and make a bet. And, you know, that was a long process to get to that point. A lot of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=910.44s)]
*  tire kicking, a lot of pressure testing, the assumptions. So I think just to wrap up this [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=915.48s)]
*  section, I would just say that there were many opportunities, but, you know, you got to, you [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=922.44s)]
*  know, this is about making the right bets, but they got to be informed. And, you know, I think [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  that having clear communication between management and investors in an appropriate way is what it [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=933.6400000000001s)]
*  takes to have people stick with the story throughout the journey. Yeah. So you touched on it a little [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=941.8800000000001s)]
*  bit, but I'd love to dig a little bit deeper on the relationship between sort of this, the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=946.92s)]
*  relationship between investor and CEO. You know, once you got the deal signed and we've invested, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=952.28s)]
*  what does that look like on a day-to-day basis? How does that? Kick your feet up. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=959.64s)]
*  Just hang out a bit. Nice. Now we did 85 red eyes in four years. Wow. And we, you know, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=968.8399999999999s)]
*  because there was education that needed to happen in order to broaden our investor syndicate, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=976.36s)]
*  we were kind of like, felt like Avis and we had to try harder. And so we were, you know, out in front, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=981.72s)]
*  you know, we probably did 300 different investor meetings last year. And that education, you know, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=986.28s)]
*  those investors also looked at who was the early supporters, who put their neck on the line, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=992.36s)]
*  what work did they do? But also it was a process where, you know, setting expectations and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=996.44s)]
*  delivering on them and being reasonable. And one of the biggest things that we kind of put our neck [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1002.68s)]
*  on the line was around our phase two timelines. Yes, most investors, most were kind of banking on [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  some type of delay because we put some aggressive timelines out there. But, you know, internally, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1012.28s)]
*  we had confidence that we could deliver them and it was important for our credibility with investors [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1016.8399999999999s)]
*  that we did. And I think that we surprised a lot of people, not only with the data, but also with [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1022.12s)]
*  the level of execution. What's that like, Josh, from your side, you know, working with a CEO and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1028.12s)]
*  management team, you know, between rounds and... Yeah, I mean, you, you know, to Mark's point, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1034.76s)]
*  you don't, you don't kick your feet up, you continue to work and you can continue to, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1039.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, pull on those loose threads, you know, so to speak, to figure out what can continue to [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1043.8s)]
*  go right and what can continue to not continue to go wrong, but what can go wrong. Right. And I think [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1049.2399999999998s)]
*  to Mark's point, I think one of the things that we were really impressed by was that as we continued [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1054.52s)]
*  to kind of dig in, that everything that we, you know, encountered or would talk about, we could [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1059.32s)]
*  go back and we could find data that was supportive of everything. And so it helped over time. Again, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1064.36s)]
*  you don't just build this confidence and then just say, okay, well, we invested, you know, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1070.12s)]
*  whatever it is, $50 million. So I hope one day that turns into this. You're actively [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1074.28s)]
*  digesting it constantly and thinking it through and reworking those things, checking the math. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1079.72s)]
*  And so, you know, I remember a lot of these early conversations, right? This is even before we, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1085.08s)]
*  you know, close the crossover, just like, oh, I have to check this box now from the standpoint of [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1091.0s)]
*  like, they just said that they have all these backup plans for enrollment that are going to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1095.64s)]
*  keep them on time. Like, is that real or is it BS? And we were able to, again, whether it's just [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1099.48s)]
*  talking to them, talking to KOLs, you put pen to paper and you start to work this stuff out. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1105.48s)]
*  You do the math and you're like, oh no, this all like makes sense. Like this is not, this is real. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1109.88s)]
*  And I believe them. And so it's being able to step through those things, again, incrementally, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1115.56s)]
*  you know, to build up the story, build up your confidence that as you're heading into these [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1122.04s)]
*  events that again, like, you know, we looked at it at first and it was like, well, Pfizer started [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1126.04s)]
*  this study like way before you guys like that's, is it even possible to catch up? And it's like, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1131.0s)]
*  well, this is how we're going to catch up. We're going to do it this way. We're going to do it [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1135.24s)]
*  this way. We're going to do this way. And then you go and you check all of that and he was like, oh, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1137.56s)]
*  well, sounds like they actually are. And they did. One other thing I would add to this discussion [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1140.44s)]
*  is that there's over a thousand public biotech companies, you know, just thinking about it from [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1146.92s)]
*  a company's perspective and back to your question around what is the role of, you know, the dialogue [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1151.4s)]
*  between, you know, management and investors as a public company. And obviously you're going to be [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1156.6s)]
*  presenting at, you know, the conferences, but also, you know, you got to, you got to be out there and [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1162.1999999999998s)]
*  be visible and be sharing the story because you're competing for, for Mindshare. And there's plenty [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  of places where people put money. Why are they going to put it with you and your team? And so I [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1173.56s)]
*  think that was part of our strategy is one is like, we had the plumbing internally to execute. We had [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1177.8s)]
*  a great team that was punching well above their weight. And we're all coming largely from big [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1182.84s)]
*  pharma people that had an entrepreneurial spirit that, you know, wanted to, you know, build their [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1187.6399999999999s)]
*  own company. So the plumbing was there to do that. And then we had a great team and IRR and, you know, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1193.0s)]
*  that was an area that I absolutely love is the interaction, the relationships that were built [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1198.28s)]
*  being out there. And, you know, it wasn't always pretty. There was, you know, we got, there were a [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1202.84s)]
*  lot of white knuckle moments. What is Pfizer going to say this morning? It can have nothing to do [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1208.4399999999998s)]
*  with what we do. It has everything to do with, you know, what's happening in the broader market [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1212.76s)]
*  and with specific companies that are competitors that impact our stock. And we would game theory [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1217.48s)]
*  those things. But at the end of the day, we, we are, our internal plan was we knew we had the better [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1222.84s)]
*  mousetrap. We knew we could move faster and we did. Yeah. So one thing I wanted to ask you about, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1229.08s)]
*  you just sort of touched on is with any successful company, especially startups, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1235.48s)]
*  there comes at least one sort of near death, you know, experience. When you think about that [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1242.44s)]
*  and Prometheus, what, what comes to mind? Was there like one big thing or is it more a series of? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1249.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that it was, this is a tale of two stories, the first two years and the second two [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1258.6000000000001s)]
*  right. The first two years was all about, you know, early science fundraising. The second part of the [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1264.8400000000001s)]
*  story was around, you know, execution and M&A strategy. You know, the second half of the story [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1270.76s)]
*  being much more fun. Look, there was a lot of white knuckle moments as we were thinking about, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1277.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, this whole question around solvency and like how much money do we have to actually [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  execute against it? You got to prioritize and making various decisions. I'll tell you one story. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1288.2s)]
*  Before we did the crossover, we did a deal with a European company on our second program. It was a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1293.72s)]
*  collaboration. We gave up European rights on that second program. What most people don't know is [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1301.88s)]
*  that that was life or death. That capital that we raised, not only did it sustain us for a number [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1306.76s)]
*  of quarters, but it actually was the validation that helped us get the crossover done. Even if [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1313.88s)]
*  it wasn't a major multinational, it was still a third party and there was an expert in the GI area [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1320.68s)]
*  that said, hey, this is really interesting what they're doing. But that was life or death. And [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1326.92s)]
*  that $20 million that we raised funded the entire second program. Initially funded the entire company, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1330.76s)]
*  but if you just take a step back, it funded the entire second program, which was part of the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1337.16s)]
*  rationale why Merck was so excited about our company is that it wasn't just a one trick pony. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1341.24s)]
*  It was a full portfolio of assets. That was one of the near death experiences that played out well [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1345.4s)]
*  by being creative with how we outlicense certain rights while preserving all the value on our lead [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1352.44s)]
*  program. Amazing. Speaking of the second half of the story, more exciting. It sounds like with the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1359.0800000000002s)]
*  Merck deal, there were a few other players involved. Going through that process, what would you say are [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1366.92s)]
*  some of the things that you did and your team did to really maximize the size of the deal, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1373.4s)]
*  the success of the deal? There were a number of factors that led to the outcome that we got. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1378.44s)]
*  Obviously, great science is the key to everything. But behind that is creating the right backdrop [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1385.0s)]
*  to maximize shareholder value. I think this was a pretty good case study. When you think about [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1394.2s)]
*  where we started $50 million to $11 billion, that second half of the story was all about [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1399.4s)]
*  one, execution, two, about the right strategy where we were painting a vision that was much [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1405.3200000000002s)]
*  grander than it wasn't about a single asset. It was about actually completely disrupting [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1412.2800000000002s)]
*  and transforming an entire category. Now, did everyone get their day one? Did we have some [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1417.8000000000002s)]
*  skeptics? Absolutely. But how do you get to an outsized return for investors on an M&A [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1423.96s)]
*  transaction? Well, it's having the capital to proceed on your own where you don't need them. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1432.44s)]
*  Following our data, we raised $500 million. That was our sign to the market that we don't need the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1439.8s)]
*  strategics. We're ready to go if we need to. I think some investors were questioning that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1448.44s)]
*  because of why are you deleting that much? You don't need that much capital. But it was a position [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1453.3200000000002s)]
*  of strength for us as we were having those negotiations. We also started a... This is all [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1459.16s)]
*  in the public domain, so there's nothing that's not public here. But I would just say that we [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1466.04s)]
*  started a partnership process in October of 22 with the idea of educating. And depending on the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  outcome of the data, we would know, hey, that's an appropriate pathway. So as disclosed in our 14-D9, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1479.32s)]
*  we had 17 parties that were under CDA getting educated. And when we got our data, I think we [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1484.9199999999998s)]
*  got the data on Thursday or Friday. On Saturday morning, I'm calling the CEOs of these companies [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1494.6799999999998s)]
*  and heads of BD and saying, hey, based upon the data, a partnership does not make sense. There's [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1498.68s)]
*  not an offer you can put on the table today that our investors would think would be a good idea [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1503.64s)]
*  and our board. And so that was yet another... And by the way, we're going to raise $500 million. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1508.1200000000001s)]
*  And so a lot of them appreciate the fact that we weren't going to force them to do diligence [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1515.0s)]
*  calls over the holidays. But also there's some that were pretty upset about it because they [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1520.28s)]
*  really wanted in earnest to do a partnership, as did we, depending on the circumstance [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1524.92s)]
*  and structure and economics. So following that, at J.B. Morgan, there was obviously a lot of [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1531.3200000000002s)]
*  discussions going on at that point that were not public at the time where a lot of interest people [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1538.1200000000001s)]
*  they knew was a competitive process. They knew that there was a lot of interest here. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1545.24s)]
*  There's... This was the largest unencumbered asset in biotech. And it was a process of playing a [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1548.76s)]
*  little hard to get, being open to a conversation, but also being confident in our path forward. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1556.28s)]
*  The last thing I'd say is having good advisors along the table. We were thinking through every [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1561.32s)]
*  detail along this, what was communicated and when. We had both Centerview and Goldman Sachs. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1565.16s)]
*  Goldman Sachs led our equity financing. Centerview was kind of running with the M&A strategy. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1572.68s)]
*  And I think that with those two banks at work and the relationships that, quite honestly, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1580.2800000000002s)]
*  that we built over the last couple of years with these pharma partners, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1586.0400000000002s)]
*  I think that those were very helpful in getting a deal done and having multiple bidders at the table [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1591.24s)]
*  because of the fact that one, they were educated, two, they had a direct line to me. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1597.72s)]
*  And in closing here on this topic, a big part of our calculation obviously is value. That's our job [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1601.48s)]
*  to maximize shareholder value, but maybe this gets me in trouble. But getting this drug in the [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1608.92s)]
*  right hands is really important. Going back to the whole reason why we actually came to Prometheus [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1613.96s)]
*  in the beginning, which is trying to transform lives of patients. And I'm confident that [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1618.3600000000001s)]
*  Dean Lee and Rob Davis, Mike Lobeshar, that team over there is fully committed to maximizing the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1624.68s)]
*  value for patients here. And it's actually bittersweet being here because as I look at [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1631.96s)]
*  other companies, there's just not many Prometheuses out there. And this was truly really special. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1639.48s)]
*  And I think that part of it was the science, part of it is the amazing team that we had. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1645.0s)]
*  And it's tough hand of the baton off to Merck, but I think it's absolutely the right thing to do [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1649.8s)]
*  as we think about several hundred million dollars of investment required to get through phase three [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1654.6s)]
*  and all the other indications that can be explored here. And in light of IRA, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1659.96s)]
*  you need to start these programs in parallel much earlier than you did before. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1665.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, an amazing deal. Congrats again on getting it done. With that in mind, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1669.3999999999999s)]
*  how do you think about what's next for you? You know, what's next for me is I'm taking two [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1677.0s)]
*  weeks in the Caribbean, so I leave tomorrow for that. And I started off, I think I told [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1684.04s)]
*  Joshua I was going to take the balance of the year off. And then my tune changed a bit and it [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1689.56s)]
*  was like, okay, I'm going to take the summer off. And so now it's going to be July. I'm holding July. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1695.32s)]
*  Look, this is one chapter is closed. There's other chapters of the book. And I think that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1700.52s)]
*  there's still a heck of a lot of unmet need out there. And, you know, in the fall, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1706.28s)]
*  there'll be more to come with what's next. But, you know, where my passion is, is, you know, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1711.32s)]
*  company building. There's still a lot of unmet need out there. And I think that going forward, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1716.12s)]
*  chapter two of the book would be a lot easier than chapter one. Some of the challenges that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1723.24s)]
*  we faced with the, you know, really early science not being capitalized. I think that on the next [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1728.52s)]
*  project, obviously, you know, we have the team, we have capital to deploy through our investors who [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1734.84s)]
*  are, you know, committed to helping to support us. And I think there is also a lot of opportunity [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1740.76s)]
*  on the consolidation side. Thinking about, you know, different biotechs where there's synergy, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1746.76s)]
*  as well as, you know, mid-stage commercial companies. So I'm excited to share what's next [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1751.72s)]
*  in the fall. Yeah, well, we'll be anticipating an announcement. One of the things that we like to ask [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1756.4399999999998s)]
*  is for an example of sort of a paradigm shifting innovation in life sciences. Is there anything [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1763.64s)]
*  that comes to mind for you, Mark? And then I'll ask Josh as well, like that you've seen [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1770.44s)]
*  that's a favorite of yours. That's 2.0. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1776.68s)]
*  All right. So maybe just talking more generally, I think the biggest thematic change over the last [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1783.4s)]
*  decade has been the fact that today, as I mentioned earlier, there's over a thousand public [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1790.84s)]
*  biotech companies. If you look back 20 years, there's probably a handful of companies working on [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1795.24s)]
*  earlier stage science. And probably, what, 70% of those are working in oncology. And that's going to [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1800.6799999999998s)]
*  change over time as, you know, immunology and cardiovascular disease become bigger. But let's [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1805.72s)]
*  just say half of them are working in oncology. Like, you know, I think that we're going to see [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1810.28s)]
*  in our lifetime a major shift in cures and, you know, finding therapies for these chronic diseases [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1815.64s)]
*  in a way that we haven't seen before. Like, this is going to be the healthcare revolution [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1824.1200000000001s)]
*  in the same way that we saw the industrial revolution of the 1900s. And I think that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1828.68s)]
*  this level of innovation that's happening in biotech companies today, you know, is going to [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1833.72s)]
*  do what big pharma can't do. The risks they're not willing to take. You know, that is the role of the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1839.64s)]
*  biotech ecosystem is to be able to take these ideas and move them faster, take different levels [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1843.8s)]
*  of risk than what a big pharma company would do and remove the bureaucracy. So I think the biggest [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1848.68s)]
*  paradigm shift is going to be just the market backdrop and how many companies are working on, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1853.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, new therapies and new targets that are going to change the lives of a lot of patients. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1858.76s)]
*  That wasn't happening 20 years ago to the same extent as it is happening today. So, you know, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1864.12s)]
*  I think for me, there's just so much opportunity here. There's plenty of Me Too and Me Better [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1869.8s)]
*  programs out there. The role of biotech is to advance new science. And I think that it's [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1876.44s)]
*  important that, you know, the system, the U.S. reimbursement system remain open to that. And [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1881.8799999999999s)]
*  they're not, you know, squashing innovation, but rather, you know, encouraging it. If you want to [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1889.3999999999999s)]
*  solve the cancer moonshot, what I'd be doing is finding as many of these, you know, early stage [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1893.1599999999999s)]
*  ideas as you possibly can, knowing that one of these ideas could, you know, be the key to unlocking, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1897.24s)]
*  you know, cures in melanoma and, you know, gastric cancer and other areas. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1902.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Before I go to Josh, I want to double click on that just a little bit. And you mentioned [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1908.52s)]
*  the IRA as sort of changing the way you look at drug development. What other things from a policy [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1914.6s)]
*  perspective do you think about that, you know, would be priorities or things to change to really [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1921.24s)]
*  power innovation, push innovation forward and encourage it? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1929.32s)]
*  So I think that there's a couple of things that I point out. And I don't want to go too far down [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1933.4s)]
*  the path there. That's going to get myself in trouble. But look, the health care system is, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1938.52s)]
*  in the U.S., is broken. How's it broken? Well, you have an insurance system that you have a lot of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1944.04s)]
*  middlemen in the process that are extracting value, but not necessarily adding to it from my [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1950.92s)]
*  perspective. And, you know, you've got to remove the incentives where, you know, they're encouraging [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1956.04s)]
*  higher prices because they benefit from that. What a lot of people outside of our industry don't [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1961.24s)]
*  understand is that most of these drugs, you know, they set a whack price and they pay a 50 to 60% [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1965.24s)]
*  rebate below that. The net price back to the pharma company after R&D cost and manufacturing cost is [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1970.44s)]
*  kind of value based. And of course, there are the bad actors and outliers out there. But in general, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1978.68s)]
*  we need to reward innovation, not penalize it. And so I think that fundamentally that that needs to, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1984.76s)]
*  you know, be reflected in our policies. And, you know, we need to think about how we fund [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1992.6000000000001s)]
*  earlier innovation. And I think that you're seeing a lot of these ideas coming out of academia. And [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=1998.28s)]
*  we're starting to see a better bridge between the investment world and academia. So that science is [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2004.44s)]
*  actually, you know, moving into companies. And to the extent that it wasn't happening before. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2011.0800000000002s)]
*  But I think that on the, you know, dysregulatory side, IRA is a challenge. And it is forcing [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2016.3600000000001s)]
*  companies to make different decisions about their portfolio. And it goes beyond just the surface [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2023.16s)]
*  level stuff of like small molecule versus biologic. There are significant downstream impacts [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2028.44s)]
*  that people haven't fully processed yet, because some of that are still unknown. But the fact of [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2034.1999999999998s)]
*  the matter is, is that you're going to see people working on treatment for younger patients, you're [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2040.12s)]
*  going to see them working on biologics, you're going to see them stacking indications earlier, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2043.32s)]
*  and you're going to see pharma make some different decisions with regards to M&A because of it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2046.6s)]
*  Like, I don't believe this is going to change. I think that we need to learn to operate within [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2051.0s)]
*  the system. And, you know, I think we need pharma and other advocacy groups to help make sure that, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2055.56s)]
*  you know, our government officials understand, you know, there's no cancer moonshot if there's [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2061.4s)]
*  no biotech. The other, the last thing I would say is that, you know, the FTC has taken a very hard [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2066.12s)]
*  line on consolidation in this space. And here is another area where it's, in my opinion, very [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2070.84s)]
*  different than tech. Our ecosystem, you know, requires there to be substantial M&A. In the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2077.8s)]
*  absence of M&A, no one's funding these higher risk projects. And so I think that, you know, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2085.48s)]
*  you got to bifurcate the different sectors and understand the dynamic that's going on here that [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2092.28s)]
*  we need consolidation here. And it should be encouraged because, you know, a lot of these [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2099.56s)]
*  Phase III programs cost a billion dollars. It's just, it's almost impossible for a lot of these [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2106.6s)]
*  companies to raise enough money to do that. So what happens? Well, those drugs take much longer [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2111.72s)]
*  to get to market and don't never realize their potential for patients. And so I think that, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2116.12s)]
*  you know, addressing those issues would go a long way in terms of making a better experience for [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2121.3999999999996s)]
*  patients and for, you know, the biotech ecosystem. Yeah, that's great. All right, Josh, your favorite [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2124.8399999999997s)]
*  paradigm shifting innovation in life sciences. I mean, I think the thing that we like to talk [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2133.48s)]
*  about here at RTW the most, right, is really just this explosion of new, you know, therapeutic [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2138.6s)]
*  modalities. So I wouldn't necessarily talk about anything specific as much as I can point my finger [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2144.6s)]
*  to like in the time that I've been here, right? So like seven plus almost eight years, I guess, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2149.64s)]
*  we've seen, you know, approvals for cell therapies, for gene therapies, we have protein degraders in [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2154.04s)]
*  the clinic now, we have gene editing in the clinic now, right? And so the way that I like to think [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2160.2s)]
*  about this and talk about it really is you have to pay attention to all of this stuff, but it's in [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2165.0s)]
*  those increments, right? Of like, being here and now, just seeing it and being ready to kind of [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2169.32s)]
*  pounce. That's actually what I'm most excited about. So I don't know if I'm actually calling [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2176.76s)]
*  out anything that's like a paradigm shift as much as like, if you do the work to understand cell [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2181.0s)]
*  therapy, then maybe you're there and you're ready when it becomes, you know, prime time to use it [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2185.24s)]
*  in immunology, for instance, right? So that's something that is coming, right? And so then [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2191.96s)]
*  similarly, you can look at a story like Prometheus and you can say, oh, it was really easy for us to [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2196.84s)]
*  get involved because having a companion diagnostic wasn't this like foreign crazy thing. It was like, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2203.08s)]
*  what are these crazy people doing talking about how they're going to increase the, you know, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2209.32s)]
*  the remission rate in this super hard disease with a genetic, you know, biomarker and a tool, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2212.68s)]
*  like that's crazy. That's not crazy at all because we'd seen that in oncology and we knew, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2219.48s)]
*  right, the potential, right, of being able to use it. And so in many respects, it's really just [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2224.76s)]
*  being able to kind of key in on those things that actually are tangible from the standpoint of them. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2230.68s)]
*  Again, having the potential for that paradigm shift, that's the thing that gets me most excited [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2240.04s)]
*  is that you're actually closest to it and you can actually almost reach out and touch it. You just [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2244.52s)]
*  have to know when to then kind of transact. And so it's, you know, it actually serves as a [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2248.84s)]
*  perfect example, right, to talk about Prometheus and use it, right, as the thing that actually is [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2253.6400000000003s)]
*  super exciting, right? We didn't even get to talk about it. And we weren't, you know, that's the one [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2259.08s)]
*  thing I'm sad about is Mark kind of alluded to is we're not going to get to see, you know, the third [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2262.52s)]
*  and the fourth and the fifth inning of Prometheus because it's going to be kind of almost behind [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2267.96s)]
*  this curtain of Merck now. That's all fine and good from our standpoint as investors, I guess. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2272.6800000000003s)]
*  In some respects, but as a scientist, it's actually disappointing because we actually, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2278.2799999999997s)]
*  like one of the key catalysts that was going to be coming up for them was actually the diagnostic, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2282.68s)]
*  you know, cohort readout. We were expecting that this quarter, right? And so as to whether or not [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2287.64s)]
*  that we ever get to actually see that, we don't know. But then it was going to be the second [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2293.24s)]
*  program and then they were going to, you know, they were going to unveil the, you know, the third [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2300.04s)]
*  program right at the end of the year. And so these are all these things that we kind of then, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2303.96s)]
*  again, as I was saying, like a scientist, we lose out on that. So there's a tough balance there. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2308.76s)]
*  I think we're pretty happy with the result. All in all, that's a very interesting take though. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2315.08s)]
*  And it shows that at heart you are a scientist and it's, you know, this is what gets people here [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2323.88s)]
*  excited about these things is not necessarily just, you know, how much did we make on this deal, but [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2331.24s)]
*  watching the science progress and getting to be a part of each of those sort of steps or innings [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2338.04s)]
*  for a company. Yeah, it'd be amazing to be here for another decade and see companion diagnostics [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2344.2s)]
*  come of age, right? In immunology. And that, again, I think about some of the early slide decks that I [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2351.3999999999996s)]
*  saw, right? That Mark and the team presented. And it was like this big group of like people that were [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2356.44s)]
*  all different colors. And it was like, you know, here's subset of IBD-1 and subset two and three [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2361.7200000000003s)]
*  and four and five and eight and 10. And we're going to be able to interrogate all of this and go after [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2367.4s)]
*  it and get it from this disease where you're only, again, putting 10, 15% of patients into remission [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2372.52s)]
*  and getting that up to something that we're used to seeing in a lot of these diseases where you can [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2378.84s)]
*  actually treat like in psoriasis, you can treat all these people super well, right? And so again, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2383.0s)]
*  like it's going to be in increments and in steps, but we'll get there. And it's just like, again, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2388.92s)]
*  I'm in a very fortunate position to be in the seat and get to see this stuff and interact with people [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2394.6s)]
*  like Mark, right? On a daily basis. And then, yeah, in these instances where we're fortunate enough to [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2399.88s)]
*  be able to finance these companies and work with them, right? Like over these periods of time, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2407.8s)]
*  it's fantastic. And it's like, again, reflecting on the last three years, in some respects, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2413.4s)]
*  it feels like ages. And then in other ways, it just feels like literally like this blink in time. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2417.96s)]
*  The only other theme I would talk through is about, which was really consequential in the [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2425.1600000000003s)]
*  Prometheus story, which is the role of data and AI and helping to unlock new opportunities for [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2430.6s)]
*  science. And we were Cedars-Sinai, Cedars-Sinai spin out. And Cedars-Sinai over the last two [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2437.24s)]
*  decades had built this amazing data set, 20,000 patients, 200,000 samples. And only through that [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2443.24s)]
*  data set can you start to really find new and unique targets like TL1A and then be able to [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2449.48s)]
*  develop diagnostics to identify the subset of patients. But this is happening all over medicine. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2455.08s)]
*  And data, along with the ability to interrogate using AI in new ways, is going to also play a big [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2460.2s)]
*  role in reshaping care for patients. And so I know that there's a lot of investors that are raising [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2468.2s)]
*  funds around AI. And I'm sure it's a decent portion of your portfolio here at RTW. But I think that [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2473.08s)]
*  that is going to be critical in terms of solving the moonshots on cancer and other areas. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2480.7599999999998s)]
*  How do you think about that, Josh, and sort of the impact of AI on [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2487.32s)]
*  development and discovery? Yeah. I mean, given my background and experience and obviously [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2493.96s)]
*  having spent time at Schrodinger, which can be classified as an AI company, there's a spectrum [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2498.76s)]
*  with which you can do it. And I think on one hand, this goes back to kind of one of the points that [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2508.6000000000004s)]
*  Mark was making, that at the end of the day, you can wield a sword or a tool or whatever it is, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2511.96s)]
*  but it really is the people that kind of sit behind that instrument that ultimately are going [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2518.52s)]
*  to be the ones that can make sense of, make the inference, if you will, to wield that technology [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2524.44s)]
*  appropriately. And so Schrodinger is an example. It's very much they've purposely built a platform [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2531.08s)]
*  that enables medicinal chemists to work more efficiently. And so that was one of the reasons [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2538.6s)]
*  why I was like, oh yeah, it's a no brainer. I want to go work there. They're doing cool stuff [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2545.96s)]
*  that helps me do my job better and more efficiently. That's smart. You can then stretch that further [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2549.3199999999997s)]
*  and you can say, oh, well, we're going to interrogate and solve biology just by clicking buttons. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2554.52s)]
*  That's like the tech attitude towards biotech, which I think is, I don't want to say it's purely [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2559.72s)]
*  and ultimate, like 100% fundamentally flawed. But if you think about, again, data and having to truly [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2565.08s)]
*  make these connections sometimes, it's not always easy and it's not always true that a computer is [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2574.36s)]
*  just going to be able to see that. So there is a balance in there. But I am a true believer in, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2579.96s)]
*  again, experienced management teams that know how to execute and write. A computer is not going to [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2586.52s)]
*  be able to tell you what the metrics are for IBD trials and how many patients are going to be able [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2591.08s)]
*  to enroll at the site if XYZ goes wrong or COVID happens. Maybe they can. I don't know. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2597.24s)]
*  But it serves to represent the experience we had here. So again, maybe going back to the earlier [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2602.84s)]
*  points I made, it's always nice to be sitting next to that and know that it's out there and [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  following it. I think for certain things, it's completely relevant and applicable. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2619.08s)]
*  Schrodinger has been around for almost three decades, three decades plus. They know what [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2624.2799999999997s)]
*  they're doing. These other companies are younger and they're maybe over-promising and under-delivering. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2628.44s)]
*  And so you never want to say no to a piece of technology. So I think you just have to pay [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2633.16s)]
*  attention to it and see what the true application of it is in that moment. And then over time, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2637.08s)]
*  it grows. All right. Well, we're running up on the end of our time here, Mark. I really appreciate [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2641.72s)]
*  you being here. This was great. Good to hear more from you and learn a bit more about your career [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2648.28s)]
*  and Prometheus. And we'll look forward to seeing what comes next for you. Yeah. No, I appreciate [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2653.88s)]
*  the opportunity and all the support, Josh and the team here at RTW. I can honestly say that [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2659.6400000000003s)]
*  without great investors, this outcome for patients would not have happened. Awesome. Awesome. Thank [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2665.8s)]
*  you. Cool. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUiAlA_RI8&t=2671.96s)]
