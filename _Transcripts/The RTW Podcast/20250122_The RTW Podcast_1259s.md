# Inside the clinic: GLP-1s with Dr. Rekha B. Kumar
**The RTW Podcast:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8)
*  Welcome to the RTW Podcast. I'm your guest host Stephanie Sirota, Partner and Chief Business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=0.0s)]
*  Officer leading the Strategic Partnerships team at RTW Investments. Today I'm speaking [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=7.36s)]
*  with Dr. Rekha B. Kumar, Endocrinologist, Obesity Medicine Specialist and Chief Medical [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=11.94s)]
*  Officer at FOUND. FOUND's platform integrates the latest medical research and clinical practices [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=17.34s)]
*  ensuring that users receive evidence-based, effective treatments. The first medical director [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  of the American Board of Obesity Medicine, Rekha currently practices endocrinology in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=28.619999999999997s)]
*  New York City. Rekha, thank you so much for joining us in the studio today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=33.14s)]
*  Thanks for having me here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=36.339999999999996s)]
*  Well, why don't we start actually with your fascinating background. Tell us why you went [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=37.78s)]
*  into medicine. You're an internist, endocrinologist, focused primarily on female patients. I'd love to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=42.82s)]
*  hear a little bit about your practice and what shaped your journey through school and then into [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  clinical medicine. I would say my interest in medicine actually stemmed from my interest [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  in endocrinology even as a teenager. I loved learning about exercise, muscle metabolism [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  and nutrition. I was a gymnast growing up. I was always intrigued by muscle mechanics [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=62.94s)]
*  and that led me down a path of science, biology, medical school. And once in medical school, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=68.34s)]
*  I really knew I wanted to focus on a specialty that included every organ and understanding [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=74.38s)]
*  how the entire body functioned together. And I also wanted a field of medicine where lifestyle [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=79.62s)]
*  and behavior affected the disease states. And that landed me in endocrinology. And I was finishing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  my training literally around the years that obesity was declared a disease, where the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  hormones that are involved in body weight regulation were just starting to be discovered. And it was [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=97.61999999999999s)]
*  a very exciting time to understand body weight regulation and metabolism. So it was sort of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=103.02s)]
*  right timing where all my interests seemed to match this new emerging field of medicine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=108.5s)]
*  People always say that obesity is so challenging because it's multifactorial. Did you think of it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=113.06s)]
*  as a disease when you were really interrogating it and when you were studying it from so many [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=119.06s)]
*  different ways before it was officially marked a disease? To call it a disease always felt bold. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=123.94s)]
*  And I think some people still don't feel great about that because should we be saying that 40% [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=130.58s)]
*  of the US population has a disease, I know that's still controversial despite the official [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=136.1s)]
*  terminology. I was aware of the dysfunction in the body, but I did not know that it was called a disease. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=142.1s)]
*  So being a clinician, what made you take this bold leap into entrepreneurship and how did that happen? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=147.94s)]
*  So like many doctors, COVID created some creativity in my career path. I think for many physicians [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=155.7s)]
*  who experienced burnout or saw people get very sick during COVID, many of us reassessed our careers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=164.38s)]
*  I was traditional academic doctor, seeing patients, doing research, writing papers, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  writing textbook chapters, and then got pulled to work in the hospital during COVID as a COVID doctor. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  During that period, I realized that what I loved was taking full care of patients, meaning doing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  their primary care, preventative health, metabolic health. A couple years ago, I said, I'm just going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=187.54s)]
*  to have a small women's health practice. And then the question was, well, what am I going to do with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  the 12 years of academic obesity that I learned and that I had become a leader in the field in? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=195.82s)]
*  And a great opportunity popped up when I met the former CEO of Found Health, which is a telehealth [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=202.9s)]
*  company that focuses on comprehensive weight care. And they were looking for a chief medical officer. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  I was thinking, well, this seems really too sophisticated for me as a clinician, but it's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=214.1s)]
*  a dream for an academic to know something so specific that it could be helpful to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=220.66s)]
*  people outside of clinical medicine. How did that impact your practice? And how did you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=224.98s)]
*  make a decision as to what you would prioritize? I was making a transition from an academic [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=230.74s)]
*  practice to a smaller practice and was starting almost with an empty schedule. 20% of my patients [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  followed me from the old practice to the smaller women's health practice, which gave me extra time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=242.42s)]
*  My plan was to be a regular Upper East Side mom, and not 10 days went by before I joined Found. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=247.78s)]
*  Now the practice has picked up and it's more of a challenge, but I love doing both. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=254.66s)]
*  Let's go back to Found and can you share the origins of the company and its mission? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=258.5s)]
*  How has that evolved as new information hits the tape? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=263.46s)]
*  Found started from a venture studio called Atomic Ventures that started hims and hers, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=267.22s)]
*  started out as a consumer company and has grown. Many people didn't have great access to obesity [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=272.18s)]
*  care despite the fact that the science was becoming more clear. So Found was started to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=278.18s)]
*  scale treatment to obesity care and expand access. And now we work with employers and health plans [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=283.86s)]
*  and continue on the consumer side. Are the patients coming to you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  asking for the drug? Have they tried other methods before asking to get on drug? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=294.1s)]
*  Ten years ago when people came to me, they really felt like they had tried everything. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=300.42s)]
*  They were often embarrassed to be there, felt like I was their last resort, and were very reluctant [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=306.5s)]
*  to take medicine because they felt like they had failed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=313.86s)]
*  They had tried everything meaning diet and exercise. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=316.66s)]
*  Correct. I'd say what's different today is that people are asking for medicine. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=319.38s)]
*  There aren't many medical conditions or disease states where people come to you asking for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  medicine. And people are seeing their friends and family have success on it. So we're definitely [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=329.14s)]
*  seeing patient demand and then on the Found side, consumer demand. There's the people that have true [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  diabetes and severe obesity, but we're seeing increased interest amongst people that have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=342.18s)]
*  less degrees of weight concerns and health concerns that want to be on the medicine for prevention. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=347.3s)]
*  Are you tracking any of the other comorbidities that come with obesity? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  Both in my practice and at Found, we track the comorbidities that come along with excess body [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=357.78s)]
*  fat. So diabetes, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, sleep apnea, heart disease. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=362.82s)]
*  And then we're starting to gather anecdotal evidence about some of the other things that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=368.58s)]
*  have been in the media, such as a reduction in desire for alcohol, some reduction in neuro [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  degenerative disease and Alzheimer's. There's a lot of anecdotal data that's now leading to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  larger studies. These are all things that we follow. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=385.06s)]
*  I think anecdotally I've heard also it reduces anxiety. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=388.18s)]
*  Yes. And it seems that because these drugs are more anti-inflammatory than we ever thought, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=391.62s)]
*  that the body and the brain are helped in many ways. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=396.74s)]
*  It may be also just a huge amount of a person's time is spent focusing on weight loss. And [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=400.26s)]
*  this kind of relieves that pressure. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=406.74s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of people have been calling that reduction in food noise. That effect [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=408.98s)]
*  of the GLP-1s on the brain is reducing food noise and people feeling less anxious or burdened by [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=413.22s)]
*  the constant decision-making around food and exercise. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=419.3s)]
*  So what about people that suffer from pretty debilitating side effects? And what has your [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  experience been with your patients? How quickly do these side effects resolve? Do some patients [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=429.22s)]
*  get off the drug entirely because they can't handle the side effects? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=435.14000000000004s)]
*  It's gotten better over the past 10 years. The first FDA approved GLP-1 for weight management [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=438.42s)]
*  came out in 2014, and that was Saxenda. We probably saw a 60% response rate, meaning that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=443.7s)]
*  60% of people lost 5% of their body weight or more. On the newest product, which is ZetBound, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=451.38s)]
*  Eli Lilly's Dual Agonist, we see 90% of patients losing 5% of their body weight or more. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=457.62s)]
*  In terms of efficacy across the population, the newer drugs are treating more people. That's still [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=464.66s)]
*  33 million Americans, potentially 10% that don't respond. In terms of side effects, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=470.26000000000005s)]
*  a significant percentage of people will initially have gastrointestinal side effects, mild nausea, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=475.22s)]
*  maybe vomiting, maybe some acid reflux. Typically resolves over a few weeks, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=480.5s)]
*  but there are some people that can't tolerate the medicine and we have to stop. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=485.62s)]
*  What about ozempic phase and other concerns around losing body mass but not really targeted [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=488.98s)]
*  fat loss? Ozempic phase can actually be seen with any kind of rapid weight loss. It seems to have [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  taken on the name because we're seeing people lose weight faster than they typically would with just [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=501.06s)]
*  diet and exercise, and we're seeing people lose more weight than they typically would. But people [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=505.70000000000005s)]
*  are concerned about that. Plastic surgeons are busy. Are you following some of the newer medications [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  that might be more targeted for fat loss? Definitely following those compounds that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=513.94s)]
*  are in clinical trials. The magrimab, which increases muscle and reduces fat, will probably [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=517.94s)]
*  first become a diabetes drug and then hopefully obesity. There are some studies that show that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  terzepotide leads to less muscle loss than semaglutide. Each generation of these drugs [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=528.34s)]
*  will likely get better in terms of preferential fat loss. I'd love to sort of understand telehealth [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=533.22s)]
*  companies and where they fit in to the digital delivery care and what you think is evolving in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=538.1s)]
*  that space. During COVID, patients didn't want to come in. Most doctors' offices had a reduction [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=543.7s)]
*  in patient volume. And when doctors' offices went on to telemedicine because of lockdowns, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=549.38s)]
*  many doctors' offices had very low volume, partially because some doctors couldn't do [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=554.74s)]
*  their work. Surgeons couldn't operate because they couldn't do it over telehealth. Endocrinology, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=559.7s)]
*  obesity medicine, and psychiatry saw an increase in their number of visits. There are some areas [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  of medicine that just really lend themselves well to telehealth. Access to obesity care was [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=569.14s)]
*  very limited. You could get really great care in a handful of academic centers, but their waitlist [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=575.38s)]
*  can be a year or longer. Telehealth has democratized obesity care. People that live in all parts of the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=579.86s)]

*  engage with the patient because there's so much of the art in addition to the science of medicine. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=639.3s)]

*  these medicines have helped them feel better about themselves, their joints feel better, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=728.1s)]

*  healthier bodies. But I've also seen the opposite, where there are people that want to rely on these [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=738.02s)]
*  drugs and don't want to do the other stuff. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=742.26s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK And in your practice, do you say, look, this is what we recommend to support your [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=744.34s)]
*  experience on the drug. We also recommend that you make some modifications to your diet or you [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=749.06s)]
*  incorporate certain exercise into your life and your daily regimen. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=755.22s)]
*  KATE BOWEN We focus on the medical diagnostic side to see if there's any complications of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=759.86s)]
*  excess body fat and we treat those, but also we are very focused on the lifestyle side, on nutrition, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=766.02s)]
*  exercise, sleep, stress, alcohol intake, and that's why my visits take a long time because I like to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=773.06s)]
*  ask all those questions. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=778.74s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK We talked a little bit about some of the different drugs. Can you talk a little bit [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=779.6999999999999s)]
*  about the mechanism of action of each? How do they do what they do? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=784.34s)]
*  KATE BOWEN The mechanism of action of GLP-1s or glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=788.18s)]
*  are that they actually mimic a hormone that we naturally make in our intestines. When we eat a [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=793.94s)]
*  meal, we make GLP-1 in our intestines. It's released into our bloodstream. It signals fullness to the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=798.9000000000001s)]
*  brain. It lowers blood sugar and delays stomach emptying. The medications are longer-acting analogs [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  that enhance all of those effects, which is why people feel full faster, longer, and they have [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=813.86s)]
*  better blood sugar control. The difference between the version in your body versus the drugs were [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=820.26s)]
*  that they were longer-acting. The second generation were even longer-acting, so you could only take [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=825.46s)]
*  them weekly. And then the molecule was tweaked slightly and it penetrated the blood-brain barrier [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=831.38s)]
*  better. We started hearing more about the brain effects. The future looks like there's going to be [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=837.62s)]
*  many different combinations of gut hormones that work in different ways, agonists, antagonists, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=842.9s)]
*  antibodies. Hopefully, we reach a point where there's so many options that we can help [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=850.02s)]
*  even those 33 million right now that I say have been non-responders. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=856.26s)]
*  What should one do to optimize the benefits of the medication? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=860.5s)]
*  So what I always remind people when we start a GLP-1 is I say, if you are not hungry or your [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=864.74s)]
*  appetite is suppressed, use that newfound control to make good choices. The point isn't to not eat. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=870.34s)]
*  Some people love that they don't have to think about anything they're eating or doing because [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=876.66s)]
*  they naturally lose weight so quickly on the medicine because it works so well at the beginning. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=880.3399999999999s)]
*  But then eventually the body starts to compensate a bit. You could even totally go back to having [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  cravings and food preference. So I ask people to use the appetite control to make good choices. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=889.4599999999999s)]
*  And because the medicines work so well, to really focus on protein intake and weight training to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=895.4599999999999s)]
*  maintain the muscle mass. What happens when a patient does plateau? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=902.5s)]
*  I always remind people that they're not going to keep losing weight. And why does that happen? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=906.34s)]
*  The body is so good at protecting its fat mass. And that's how we are adapted for survival. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=910.82s)]
*  That plateau will happen in different places for different people at different times. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=917.38s)]
*  If it's at a healthy weight, meaning that somebody's joints feel good, they feel good in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=921.86s)]
*  their body, there's no blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure issues, that can be a healthy [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=926.6600000000001s)]
*  weight for them. According to BMI, that might still look like a high number, but I try to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=930.74s)]
*  reassure people that the goal isn't to be as skinny as possible, it's to be as healthy as [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=934.66s)]
*  possible. If somebody hits a plateau where they still have health-related complications, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=938.3399999999999s)]
*  we might have to increase the dose, change medicines, add medicine. If people continue [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=943.4599999999999s)]
*  to plateau or to have rebound weight gain, bariatric surgery is still an option. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=947.9399999999999s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Is the expectation that this is going to be a short or medium term [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=952.18s)]
*  fix? Are some patients thinking about it as a lifestyle change and they will be on these [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=957.86s)]
*  drugs forever? DR. KELSEY HAUSER So nobody wants to be on a medicine forever. And unfortunately, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=963.38s)]
*  what the science shows us on these medicines is that when they're prescribed appropriately, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=968.66s)]
*  meaning for people with a body mass index that's quite high, with weight-related comorbidities, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=973.78s)]
*  and they stop the medicine, two-thirds of the weight is regained in the first year. But what [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=978.42s)]
*  we're seeing is a little out of the box prescribing people of lower body weights and healthier people [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=983.22s)]
*  taking the medicine. And I do believe that some percentage of those people will come off the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=990.1s)]
*  medicine, at least for stretches of time. And then if they notice weight regain, they can go back on [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=995.22s)]
*  it. LESLIE KENDRICK Does the medical community see this as a new statin or a new blood pressure [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1000.1s)]
*  medication that someone could, in theory, just take it for the rest of their life and be great? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1004.5s)]
*  DR. KELSEY HAUSER The science would support thinking about it like a statin or a high blood [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1009.14s)]
*  pressure medicine. When somebody takes a statin and reaches their goal cholesterol, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1013.0600000000001s)]
*  people don't typically say, well, can I stop my Lipitor now? Yet because of weight stigma and how [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1018.1s)]
*  we think about weight, not just patients but even doctors want to stop these medicines on people. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1024.42s)]
*  If we see a cohort of patients that can come off the medicine and maintain their weight loss, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1030.42s)]
*  I suspect it's a group of people that didn't have a lot of metabolic disease to begin with. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1034.26s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Do you see obesity attracting a lot of med school students? And is it an area [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1038.58s)]
*  that's pulling people in? DR. KELSEY HAUSER Historically, it pulled people in kind of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1044.34s)]
*  mid-career. So people that already had been practicing for 10 to 15 years that started [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1048.26s)]
*  to realize that the real issue in their patient population was how obesity and chronic disease [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1054.34s)]
*  was affecting their health. We're seeing an earlier interest in people right outside of [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1060.58s)]
*  med school and residency wanting to have this knowledge. What is still tricky is that the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1064.74s)]
*  business model of somebody practicing in this field is a challenge. If you look at the billing [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1071.86s)]
*  codes and the reimbursement of treating obesity, it's a lot of time and a lot of effort without [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1076.5s)]
*  great reimbursement. So for people that have loans, the average medical student has like $200,000 of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1082.34s)]
*  debt when they come out of med school. Some people may be discouraged to do so. I would encourage [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1087.78s)]
*  them to pursue it and hopefully a lot of this will be rectified if in fact Medicare and Medicaid [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1093.2199999999998s)]
*  start covering these medicines and we go in that direction. LESLIE KENDRICK What's your biggest worry? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1099.7s)]
*  DR. KELSEY HAUSER My biggest worry is the possible health equity concern that is coming up with the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  cost of these meds. If we're talking about a 20% reduction in heart disease, reduction in [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1110.1000000000001s)]
*  neurodegenerative disease, fatty liver, all of these health benefits and only wealthy people [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1115.06s)]
*  have access and poor people don't, I fear that the country would be going in two different directions. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1120.02s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK At least until they go off patent. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1124.82s)]
*  Correct. Looking into your crystal ball, tell us about your hopes for the future of obesity medicine. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1127.3s)]
*  DR. KELSEY HAUSER I think the future is very bright in terms of drug development and research, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1132.1799999999998s)]
*  understanding the neurohormonal regulation of body weight and the drugs that are coming. What I still [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1138.58s)]
*  have questions about is how we are going to improve the food supply, get people to continuously be [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1145.3799999999999s)]
*  active, the way we design our cities and encourage people to be mobile and walk. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1151.62s)]
*  My hope is that we can actually prevent what has happened in the United States in developing [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1156.4199999999998s)]
*  countries. So the whole metabolic disease epidemic in the United States occurred when our food supply [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1163.78s)]
*  changed rapidly, we became sedentary. But what we see in the developing world is actually malnutrition [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1170.26s)]
*  and obesity existing together. And that really happens when there's rapid urbanization. My hope [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1176.58s)]
*  for the future is that we can recognize these patterns and in certain areas of the world, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1182.98s)]
*  maybe as urbanization happens, also encourage those populations to focus on preventative health. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1187.3799999999999s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK We can look back to history to learn and hopefully [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfPyY4xnO8&t=1193.3s)]
