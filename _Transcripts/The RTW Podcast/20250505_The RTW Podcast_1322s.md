*  Welcome to the RTW Podcast. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=14.24s)]
*  I'm today's host, Conor Williams, Senior Research Analyst at RTW, responsible for research [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  in neurological disease. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=21.76s)]
*  Today I'm speaking with esteemed industry colleague, Dr. Vili Valcheva, CEO of GH Research, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=23.8s)]
*  a cutting-edge biotech company advancing therapies for psychiatric and neurological [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=29.96s)]
*  disorders. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=34.28s)]
*  You wouldn't normally find me in RTW's podcast studio, but there's quite a bit going on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=35.4s)]
*  in neuropsych that's worth talking about. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=39.96s)]
*  I recently had a conversation with our Chief Business Officer, Stephanie Sirota, about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=41.96s)]
*  the emergence of psychedelics as a transformative therapy for treatment-resistant depression. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  And now I have the privilege of speaking to Dr. Valcheva, an industry leader with more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  than 20 years of leadership experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=56.16s)]
*  including companies such as Albareo, Ipsin and Sanofi. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=61.48s)]
*  Vili, thank you for joining us today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Great to be here, Conor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=67.62s)]
*  I'm really excited about this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=68.62s)]
*  Let's begin with GH Research. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=70.36s)]
*  What is GH Research and what's the main problem you're trying to solve? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=72.4s)]
*  GH Research is a biotech company. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=76.36s)]
*  We are headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=78.44s)]
*  We are developing a treatment for mental diseases and our value proposition is that it would [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=80.64s)]
*  be a practice-changing treatment that would lead to ultra-rapid remission, which can be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=86.32s)]
*  sustained with infrequent administrations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=91.26s)]
*  Patients with depression nowadays suffer insurmountably. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=94.92s)]
*  They have years of depressive symptoms without any treatments that could lead to remission. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Usually it takes oral antidepressants four to six weeks to work and there's very low [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=105.56s)]
*  percentage of patients that get any remission. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=109.96s)]
*  We're developing a new treatment, GH001, that could lead to improvement in the depressive [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  symptoms even on the same day of the treatment and then is sustained months and months with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  infrequent administrations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=123.56s)]
*  I know you said you're treating depression, but it's specifically treatment-resistant [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=125.56s)]
*  depression. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=129.48s)]
*  What's the difference between that and maybe run-of-the-mill depression that you might [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=130.48s)]
*  first treat with an SSRI? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=133.84s)]
*  So patients with treatment-resistant depression would have multiple major depressive episodes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=135.8s)]
*  They would be treated with at least two prior treatments that would have been taken in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=141.18s)]
*  appropriate dose and would be ineffective for weeks. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=145.74s)]
*  These patients with time become resistant to any antidepressive treatments and it's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=149.3s)]
*  hard to find a new treatment, so they could suffer for years before anything works. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=155.12s)]
*  So that's the treatment-resistant depression. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  There is a high unmet need and believe it or not, there's millions of patients out [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=162.28s)]
*  there in need of new treatment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=166.44s)]
*  Right, three million patients in the US with treatment-resistant depression. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=168.2s)]
*  Yeah, correct. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=171.88s)]
*  I know Standard of Care's SPROVATO. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=172.88s)]
*  How do you think about SPROVATO, particularly as it compares to your therapy that you're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  developing? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=180.48s)]
*  Yeah, SPROVATO is currently the benchmark. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=181.48s)]
*  It gained approval a few years ago. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  The difference between SPROVATO and us is that SPROVATO has a very complex induction [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=186.6s)]
*  system where you need to give it twice a week for four weeks and then once a week for four [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=192.6s)]
*  more weeks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=197.76s)]
*  It takes time for patients to feel the benefit and go in remission. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=198.76s)]
*  With GH001, which is our treatment, patients are treated once. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  On the same day, they already see benefit, which are faced to be data showed, and that's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=207.4s)]
*  sustained with a lot less treatments. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=212.72s)]
*  On average, four treatments for six months. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=215.1s)]
*  How long would a treatment visit last? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=217.73999999999998s)]
*  With GH001, one day in the interventional psychiatric clinic should be around one to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  three hours. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  There is one hour observation period after which patients are ready to go home. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  How long do you think patients can go between doses of GH001? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=230.72s)]
*  We foresee that there will be infrequent treatment visits, so maybe on average four treatments [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=234.94s)]
*  in six months. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  We are still in face-to-be. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  We're planning for a pivotal program. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  The pivotal program will show us a lot more for the future of the treatment. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=245.62s)]
*  I guess as well something else that happens is when a treatment is in the market and it's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=249.86s)]
*  available to physicians with time, they learn how to use it and it all optimizes the treatment [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=254.5s)]
*  regimen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=260.02000000000004s)]
*  What was compelling about GH that attracted you to work at GH and what do you think is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=261.3s)]
*  the biggest potential risk? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  I was the chief medical officer in the company when the board offered me to become the CEO [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=267.64s)]
*  I'll never forget that day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=273.58s)]
*  We were on holidays and I told my husband, you know, I might become the CEO of my company [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=275.58s)]
*  and he said, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  I am extremely lucky to have a very supportive husband. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=284.9s)]
*  We've been married 30 years now and he knows that I'm an ambitious woman. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  So he's been very supportive with me becoming a CEO. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  Why did I take the job? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=296.46s)]
*  Being the chief medical officer, I was deeply involved into the phase to be conduct. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=298.38000000000005s)]
*  And I already knew that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to change the treatment [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=303.66s)]
*  paradigm of such a big disease. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=308.54s)]
*  As much as it sounds a cliche, I thought, you know, becoming the CEO of the company [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=310.26000000000005s)]
*  gives me the ability to hold the destiny of this drug in our own hands rather than entrust [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  it in somebody that would come from outside. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=322.3s)]
*  So I've got a great team at GH. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=325.1s)]
*  I've got a fantastic drug that we all know that it works based on the phase to be data. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=328.3s)]
*  I guess the biggest challenge is not to mess it up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=334.22s)]
*  And it's all about execution. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=336.86s)]
*  I am a very much execution type of person. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=338.86s)]
*  So it also made me think perhaps I'm the right person for this particular treatment, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=342.06s)]
*  for this particular company. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=347.5s)]
*  And that's how I took the job. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=348.86s)]
*  Maybe even before that, there was a time point where you were researching what 5-methoxy-DMT was. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=350.7s)]
*  I guess, what were your first thoughts? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=356.62s)]
*  Because 5-methoxy-DMT, it's not exactly a regular molecule you come across every day. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=358.62s)]
*  When I read about 5-meo-DMT and GH research, I thought, you know, that's a challenge worth [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=363.98s)]
*  taking because come on, everyone has a relative or a friend that have been depressed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  And there is complexity around psychedelics. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=376.46s)]
*  But it's not something I'm not able to face. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=379.02s)]
*  So these were my thoughts. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=381.5s)]
*  Maybe complex, but more exciting and definitely worth taking on as a challenge. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=383.18s)]
*  What do you think makes GH-01 different from other treatments in development for [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=388.38s)]
*  treatment-resistant depression? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=392.85999999999996s)]
*  If you're a depressed patient, struggled through many years, can't enjoy life, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=394.78s)]
*  can't enjoy time with your family, you can't go to work, you want something to work quickly, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=399.82s)]
*  You don't want to wait for weeks and be exposed to multiple side effects before you get some benefit, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=407.18s)]
*  if any. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=412.7s)]
*  And the difference with GH-001 is that you go to the clinic, it's a visit of one to three hours, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  you do the inhalation, which could be one to three inhalations, depending on what dose you need. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=420.54s)]
*  And after that, there is improvement in your depressive symptoms two hours later. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=426.06s)]
*  That's, I think, is number one difference. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=430.94s)]
*  The second difference is that oral antidepressants you take every day and you suffer from the multiple [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  side effects they have. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=439.97999999999996s)]
*  Spravato has this complex regimen. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  Patients could be drowsy even on the next day, they can't drive, they need to be driven home. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=444.14s)]
*  With GH-001, usually the side effects are mild to moderate, they're around the psychoactive phase, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=449.34s)]
*  and 97.4% of the patients in our phase to BITRA were discharge ready one hour within [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=455.58s)]
*  the last dose and there was no sedation and no dissociation at discharge. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=462.86s)]
*  You also have the convenience of infrequent treat treatments and four times on average in six months [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=467.98s)]
*  is really doable compared to everything else that you need to either take every day or twice a week [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=474.46000000000004s)]
*  or once a week. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  A lot of the psychedelics are developed with mandated psychotherapy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=480.94s)]
*  Our program is without mandated psychotherapy, which brings simplicity. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  When you go to the clinic, you're administered and you can go home. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=490.86s)]
*  There is no necessity to have psychotherapy sessions, which improves the cost, the scalability [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=494.7s)]
*  in the commercial model and gives the patient choice. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=500.06s)]
*  I've said it before that I find it to be a really compelling data set and I think it is the best [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=503.18s)]
*  treatment-resistant depression data at least I've ever seen in my life. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=509.42s)]
*  I can't think of another study that's any better. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=512.3000000000001s)]
*  The delta is 15 points on the Madras scale, placebo-adjusted. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=515.82s)]
*  Could you help us understand what the treatment effect was to patients and how it compares to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=519.9s)]
*  standard of care? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=524.78s)]
*  For us just to say it's 15.5 points. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=525.9s)]
*  Just making sure we sweat a lot for this data. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=531.1s)]
*  For other companies, half a point would mean a lot and it would be most of their effect size. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=533.98s)]
*  I remember when we were in our office on the Friday before the data came out, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=539.02s)]
*  me, Rod and Gotham were betting what the placebo-adjusted delta would be. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=543.1s)]
*  I was saying I would be happy with anything north of seven and Gotham was saying he thinks [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=548.06s)]
*  it would be closer to nine or ten. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=553.7399999999999s)]
*  When you first showed us the data and it was a 15-point delta, I remember being more shocked [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=555.66s)]
*  than I've ever been in my life because it's incredible, but to anyone that doesn't know [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  what a 15.5 Madras delta is, what does that mean? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=566.4599999999999s)]
*  Even on the day of administration already when patients come out of the treatment room, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=570.06s)]
*  they say that they can put tasks into problems. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=574.94s)]
*  They can cope with the complexity of life, which was a massive burden because of the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=579.0200000000001s)]
*  depression, better. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  They can do things one by one and start enjoying life. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=585.82s)]
*  So patients might want a nice meal or a nice cappuccino, go to a cafe or go to the movies [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=589.98s)]
*  with their family. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=596.3800000000001s)]
*  And to you and me, that might sound trivial, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=597.5s)]
*  Okay, we can just go to the movies. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=600.94s)]
*  But depressed patients, they lose the ability to enjoy life and to participate in life. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=602.86s)]
*  They don't have friends, their family is usually staying away from them, they lose their jobs [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=609.9s)]
*  or they're not efficient. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=615.98s)]
*  So a reduction of Madras of 15 is a tremendous improvement in somebody's way of how they [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=617.1800000000001s)]
*  feel and how they enjoy life. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=624.62s)]
*  If I'm remembering, Spravado remission rates are 20% and you guys had north of 50? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=626.46s)]
*  So Spravado remission rate with the monotherapy that is their most recent data at day 28, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=631.5s)]
*  which is their primary endpoint, is 21%. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=637.26s)]
*  And our emission rate is 57.5% on day eight. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=640.62s)]
*  First, you see it on the same day or in the first week, the change in the patient, even [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=644.86s)]
*  the neighbor notices it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=649.42s)]
*  And with Spravado, it's gradual and you never reach these high levels of remission like [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=651.18s)]
*  with GA001. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=656.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=657.98s)]
*  I still think about people I know telling me that the data had to be fake because the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=658.48s)]
*  placebo was too low. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=664.96s)]
*  I'm like, what do you want? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=666.32s)]
*  The placebo can't be 10 or you'll be upset. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=667.36s)]
*  But if the placebo is less than five, you're still upset. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=670.08s)]
*  Insanity. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=673.04s)]
*  Human nature. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  Human nature, right. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=674.72s)]
*  But a lot of the top QLs think this is our biggest achievement. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=675.84s)]
*  It provoked this wave of QLs that now are writing up papers and guidance on how to manage [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=679.6s)]
*  functional and blinding in order to support us with the FDA. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=686.16s)]
*  So they're actually talking on our behalf to the FDA for the measures to address functional [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  and blinding so it doesn't become a hurdle. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=695.28s)]
*  Obviously, 5-Methoxy DMT is a scheduled substance in the United States. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=697.52s)]
*  Could you maybe talk about the difficulties of developing and running trials with a scheduled [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=702.0s)]
*  substance? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=706.88s)]
*  A very important point and learning from the phase two is planning because you need to get [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  these control drug licenses for the sites and every new trial, every new drug, you need [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=713.2s)]
*  to get a separate license. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  That takes time. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=720.24s)]
*  So it's important to plan and to take into consideration the US regulations, but also [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=721.76s)]
*  each state because it could differ by state. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  Then there's also rules how to manufacture, how to distribute and how to store the drug [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=730.48s)]
*  on site. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=736.0s)]
*  There's multiple rules and regulations that we need to observe. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  Now that we've completed a large trial with 80 patients and more than 20 sites, we've [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=740.72s)]
*  got the know-how how to do it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=745.76s)]
*  Exciting. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=748.16s)]
*  5-Methoxy DMT is a psychedelic and there's obviously a lot of stigma. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=748.88s)]
*  How do you deal with that while developing it as a serious medicine to help patients [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=752.64s)]
*  with an unmet need? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=757.28s)]
*  It's changing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=758.4s)]
*  There's countries where it's a lot easier now to develop psychedelics such as Australia, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=759.6s)]
*  Netherlands, some of the states here. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=764.8s)]
*  How do we do it? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=767.12s)]
*  Media needs to stay away from these stories that could lead to stigma, but rather focus [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=768.24s)]
*  on the positive results such as our data and the fact that psychedelics can change the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=774.0s)]
*  treatment paradigm of mental diseases, not just depression, but PTSD, anxiety and many [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=779.84s)]
*  others. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=785.6s)]
*  So it's a combined effort between us biotechs and we need to always present the positive [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=786.0s)]
*  data that we generate, but also the media should divert their focus from sensations [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  and focus on the positive data which would destigmatize psychedelics. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=798.24s)]
*  I know there's often a lot of media arguing that they're not safe. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=803.12s)]
*  I guess with your compound, 5-Methoxy DMT, what gives you confidence that this compound [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=807.36s)]
*  is safe to give to the masses of people who have TRD and need another option? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=812.24s)]
*  Well, our compound is synthetically manufactured in GMP facilities. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=817.36s)]
*  We derive pure 5-Methoxy DMT. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  We know exactly what dose we are delivering to the patient. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  We are delivering GA001 in a safe clinical setting and it will be one day in the interventional [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=829.5200000000001s)]
*  psychiatric clinics. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  The phase 2b data shows that we've had no serious adverse events in our double-blind [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=837.5200000000001s)]
*  data that we presented and that most of the adverse events that patients see are mild [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=842.1600000000001s)]
*  to moderate such as headache, nausea and others that subside around the psychoactive phase. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=847.12s)]
*  It's important to differentiate, retreat and being a severely depressed patient going [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=853.44s)]
*  to the clinic for treatment. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=859.6s)]
*  There's a big difference. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=860.96s)]
*  Can you explain the drawbacks of paradigms that use psychotherapy in combination with [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=862.32s)]
*  a psychedelic? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=867.6s)]
*  Therapies developed with psychotherapy have few hurdles to overcome. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=868.8s)]
*  The FDA and other regulators don't regulate psychotherapy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=872.96s)]
*  Number two would be cost because psychotherapy adds to the cost of the overall treatment. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=877.12s)]
*  And added to that is the convenience because when you go to an interventional psychiatric [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=883.28s)]
*  clinic, you need to factor in the cost of psychotherapies, the time, which would bring [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=888.72s)]
*  a different commercial model compared to what we have. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=893.2s)]
*  Obviously, you guys have presented really impressive data recently. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  But what are you most proud of during your time at GH? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=900.64s)]
*  What really fulfills you about the job? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=903.6s)]
*  What fulfills me is success. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=905.52s)]
*  That is what drives me the most. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=907.6s)]
*  And it's not success driven by my own ego. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  Every little success makes me extremely proud. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  It's success with the data. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=916.4s)]
*  But it's the success in the BD and the PPD trials as well, which were very positive. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=918.4s)]
*  Developing our own device, every single step we take towards making this drug available [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=923.12s)]
*  makes me proud and happy. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=930.16s)]
*  Yeah, the bipolar data as well as the postpartum, that maybe touches on something interesting [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=931.92s)]
*  in psychiatry. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=936.64s)]
*  What other indications aside from treatment resistant depression do you think that a molecule [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  like 5-Methoxy DMT could be purposed for? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=943.04s)]
*  So we've got a long list of different indications that we've been approached by the scientific [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=946.4799999999999s)]
*  community, academic centers, QLs that definitely see GH001 would work. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=952.56s)]
*  We have the proof of concept in postpartum depression and bipolar disorder too. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=959.36s)]
*  These are two conditions with very high unmet need. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=963.68s)]
*  We also see from our phase 2b data that GH001 works really well in anxiety. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=967.28s)]
*  PTSD, for example, is another condition. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=973.12s)]
*  Patients with terminal end stage cancer as well could be another area. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=976.0s)]
*  Uncurable pain, chronic pain. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=981.12s)]
*  That's the good about GH001 that once we develop it for TRD, then we can expand on other indications. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=983.84s)]
*  I actually do have a question now and I'm genuinely curious because I don't know the answer. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=991.6s)]
*  5-Methoxy DMT, it got its international non-proprietary name. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=997.12s)]
*  Mebufotinin. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1001.12s)]
*  Okay, how do you pronounce that? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1002.08s)]
*  I've been trying to figure it out. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  Mebufotinin. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1004.08s)]
*  Mebufotinin? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1005.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1006.32s)]
*  Internally at GH, obviously you refer to your program as GH001, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  but when you have to refer to the compound, has mebufotinin taken over yet? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1011.68s)]
*  Or is it still 5-Methoxy DMT? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1018.4s)]
*  We've developed our formulation, it's proprietary. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1021.04s)]
*  We have the device so we refer to it as GH01 or mebufotinin. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1024.72s)]
*  Okay, I like it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1029.52s)]
*  I'm going to practice that a whole bunch more and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1030.56s)]
*  maybe I'll come back and be able to pronounce it next time I... [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1032.96s)]
*  It's the bufo. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1035.84s)]
*  Oh, oh that makes sense, the frog. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1037.12s)]
*  Mebufotinin. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1040.72s)]
*  I don't know if it's related to the frog, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1041.92s)]
*  but it definitely makes it easier for you to say it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1043.68s)]
*  In terms of GH's trajectory, where do you see the company going in the future? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1046.56s)]
*  Our focus is to overcome the hurdles in the US and have a global pivotal program [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1050.64s)]
*  and then develop the treatment for TRD, look at other indications [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1055.44s)]
*  and expand into other mental diseases. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1061.12s)]
*  That's my goal. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1064.24s)]
*  I think GH has the opportunity to become a big player. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1064.96s)]
*  We absolutely agree. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1068.72s)]
*  Your product GH01, which is 5-Methoxy DMT, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1070.3200000000002s)]
*  it's derived from a frog that you can find particularly in the Sonoran desert. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1074.24s)]
*  Have you ever seen one of the frogs in real life? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1078.88s)]
*  So I was at ACMP last year in Arizona and you're going to find it very funny, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  but I did go to look for a toad. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  One of the QLs told me that in order to see a toad it needs to rain [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1090.0s)]
*  and it didn't rain for a long time in Arizona. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1094.3200000000002s)]
*  So no, I haven't seen a real toad, but I can tell you that we manufacture GH001 [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1097.76s)]
*  synthetically in GMP facilities and there are no toads involved into the manufacturing. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1104.56s)]
*  No toad farms in the future of GH. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1109.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1112.4s)]
*  Apparently you have to startle the toads to get the secretion of bufotoxin. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1114.96s)]
*  Do you know exactly how they scare the toads? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1120.24s)]
*  To be honest, I don't know how exactly it's done. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  If you want to join me, you and I can go look for a toad and gently startle it [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1126.24s)]
*  and then we can leave the audience on a cliffhanger [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1132.08s)]
*  because next time you and I meet we can tell them what happened. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1134.48s)]
*  Okay, I love this. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1137.52s)]
*  Maybe shifting gears to talk about you, what do you attribute your success to? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1139.04s)]
*  What type of leader are you? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1144.0s)]
*  And do you have any advice for young people who see you as a role model, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1145.28s)]
*  particularly young women in the industry? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1149.6s)]
*  Since I was a kid, I've always been very ambitious and I always strived for success. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1151.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm also a very positive person and an extrovert. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1157.28s)]
*  I love to engage with people externally and the CRO actually allowed me to expand [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  on my areas of engagement, not just QLs, but I now engage with Wall Street and investors, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1168.1599999999999s)]
*  engage with media and it's something that I really, really enjoy because it allows me to [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1175.28s)]
*  spread the positive side of the development and the accomplishments we have with GH001. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1180.08s)]
*  As a leader, I like to deconstruct complexity and make it simple and then [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1186.48s)]
*  have a crystal clear vision that I communicate to people. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1191.52s)]
*  See your job is not for the faint-hearted, it's really busy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1196.8s)]
*  There's a lot of commitment required. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1200.72s)]
*  You need to be very careful to keep your balance because you can easily just only [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1203.04s)]
*  work and do nothing else and you need to enjoy it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1208.56s)]
*  What I say to my team is I will do everything to inspire you and to bring you forward on our [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1212.32s)]
*  mission, but you need to be happy with what you do. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1219.84s)]
*  You need to enjoy the ride as long as it goes and be happy with our mission. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1222.8s)]
*  I guess that's who I am as a leader, very open, very transparent. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1227.76s)]
*  One of my favorite thing is to have young people on the team and see them evolve. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1231.52s)]
*  I just wanted to say, believe in yourself, but then live in the today. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1236.3200000000002s)]
*  Also super, super important, be ambitious and never be mediocre. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the road to success. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1245.6000000000001s)]
*  Philly, thanks so much for speaking with us today and giving me more airtime on one of [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZmCXWYJ6IE&t=1247.2s)]
