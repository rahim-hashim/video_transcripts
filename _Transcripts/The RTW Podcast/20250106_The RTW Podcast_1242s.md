# The $1 trillion GLP-1 revolution with Rod Wong
**The RTW Podcast:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc)
*  This is the first innovation in healthcare, not just drugs, all of healthcare, to create [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=0.0s)]
*  somewhere a little bit north of $1 trillion in value. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  That sounds like a big number, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=9.16s)]
*  So let's contextualize that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=10.56s)]
*  Welcome to the RTW podcast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=13.44s)]
*  I'm your guest host, Stephanie Sirota. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=15.36s)]
*  I'm a partner and chief business officer leading the strategic partnerships team at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=17.48s)]
*  RTW Investments. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=22.2s)]
*  Today I'm speaking with Rod Wong, our founder, managing partner and chief investment officer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=23.96s)]
*  Here we are today talking about one of our favorite topics, GLPs and obesity. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=28.88s)]
*  Let me just start with a very, very basic question, but why are GLP ones so important? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=34.44s)]
*  GLPs have been around for a while. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=39.92s)]
*  GLPs started in diabetes with Bayetta and then there has basically been iterative innovation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=41.64s)]
*  over the last 20 years that finally moved it from diabetes now into obesity. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=46.76s)]
*  It's the most common disease in Western society. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=52.84s)]
*  I think it's over 100 million Americans. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=56.16s)]
*  It is highly linked to three of the top 10 causes of death, cardiovascular disease number [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=58.32s)]
*  one, stroke and diabetes are on the list. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=63.68s)]
*  It's also strongly associated with other diseases in the top 10, cancer, dementia, kidney disease. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=66.08s)]
*  And I think the very good news is that we've started getting outcome studies from some [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=73.8s)]
*  of the GLPs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=79.64s)]
*  You're basically seeing improvements north of 20% as high as 30% depending on the disease, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=80.64s)]
*  improvements in heart failure, in kidney disease. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=87.08s)]
*  We've had positive outcome studies in osteoarthritis, in fatty liver and in sleep apnea. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=89.32s)]
*  People's quality of life improves. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=95.72s)]
*  It is probably the most significant medical advance in terms of the sheer numbers of impact [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=97.6s)]
*  that we've seen in a couple of decades. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=103.8s)]
*  Now, do you think we're seeing some of these better vitals, better stats on these patients [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=105.8s)]
*  who've been taking them because of the actual small molecule that they're taking or is it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=111.68s)]
*  because of the weight loss? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  The actual weight loss must be a huge component of that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=118.84s)]
*  But there are other things that are emerging that clearly are major contributors as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  For example, the impact of GLPs on inflammation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=126.12s)]
*  Are you seeing differences that some might be better to target inflammation, some might [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=129.44s)]
*  be better to target other specific conditions? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  We're still pretty early days, but when you are moving to the next generation of GLP, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=137.32s)]
*  what a lot of people are focused on are adding additional mechanisms, hitting multiple things [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=142.28s)]
*  at one time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=146.48s)]
*  Let's talk about where we are in the current cycle of obesity drug development. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=147.76s)]
*  You're super, super early. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=151.32s)]
*  Right now, the best GLPs are of course from Eli Lilly and Novo. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=152.76s)]
*  Each one has a key active ingredient that they've built products around. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  So with Lilly, it's terzapetide. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=161.32s)]
*  They have the brand names Monjaro for type 2 diabetes and ZetBound for obesity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=164.04s)]
*  With Novo, it's semaglutide and there it's Ozempac and Wegovi. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=169.64s)]
*  They're doing about $40 billion in sales right now as a run rate, but two thirds of that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=173.6s)]
*  is from diabetes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=178.12s)]
*  You have this duopoly between Lilly and Novo. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  That's going to last through at least the end of 2025. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  And they are, as you know, just weekly injectables. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=187.2s)]
*  Then in 26, 27, you're probably going to get your first oral. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  You're going to get a couple of new mechanisms in there, hopefully amlin, glucagon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=194.02s)]
*  Then in 28, through the end of the decade, you're going to get drugs that give you more [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=198.78s)]
*  weight loss but are still injectables and a smattering of additional mechanisms. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=202.8s)]
*  So obesity is just getting started. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=208.22s)]
*  How are patients going to know which one they should be taking? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  Or do you see patients rotating from one generation drug to the next generation? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  Is it going to be determined based on who their doctor is? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=220.3s)]
*  If you think about the products that we have, as great as they are, the stats say that half [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=223.56s)]
*  of patients come off of them within six months, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=227.88s)]
*  Because they've achieved the weight loss desired or because... [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=232.04s)]
*  So the rate of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea is just too high right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=235.36s)]
*  There are a lot of ways in which you can improve these products. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Of course, there'll be people that prefer pills. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=244.88s)]
*  Some of the novel mechanisms like amlin, for example, we're hearing it described as your [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=247.44s)]
*  urge to eat doesn't decrease, but you're satisfied after eating less. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=252.8s)]
*  There'll be room for lots of different medications. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=257.88s)]
*  People will naturally prefer different things. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=261.12s)]
*  Now, it makes sense that when you need to lose weight, you're on drug. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=263.16s)]
*  What happens when you've reached your ideal weight? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=268.16s)]
*  Are these intended to be lifelong drugs or is it intended for a shorter period of time? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=271.68s)]
*  Everyone will have different goals. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=278.16s)]
*  And I think people are managing it in ways that you would expect. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=280.48s)]
*  Maybe you want to maintain as opposed to lose more. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=284.04s)]
*  And so you work with your doctor to find a new dose that works for that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=287.68s)]
*  Big picture, a very large proportion of people want to permanently be at a lower number when [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  all these access barriers have declined a lot. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=298.72s)]
*  I think it'll be like other medications that have these meaningful health benefits, that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  you should have significant proportions of people on these things for relatively long [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=307.08s)]
*  periods of time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  It sounds like there's a lot more happening in the private space, but maybe talk about [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  what you're seeing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=318.28s)]
*  How many public companies are there that are interesting and what are the private companies [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=319.28s)]
*  looking like? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=322.96s)]
*  If you look at where we are today, there's only about 10 publicly traded biotech companies [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=323.96s)]
*  that are focused on obesity. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=329.68s)]
*  Given that this is the largest opportunity and unmet need in the history of the drug [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=333.04s)]
*  industry, that is a very small number. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=337.88s)]
*  What you should definitely see is that go from 10 to maybe 30 biotech companies. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=340.24s)]
*  That's obviously an opportunity in the public space, but that is a major opportunity in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=346.44s)]
*  the private space. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=351.16s)]
*  So we're focused on both of those areas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  Do you think that we'll end up with that duopoly with everyone else being integrated into one [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=354.72s)]
*  of those two companies? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=360.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you see others emerging that can be standalone, substantially large, successful companies that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=361.73999999999995s)]
*  are anchored in obesity? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=368.26s)]
*  It will definitely be more than two companies. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=369.26s)]
*  If you look at the 20 largest global drug companies, over a third of them are now chasing [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=372.14s)]
*  obesity. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  Will you have small companies grow up and self commercialize and be able to get some [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=378.78s)]
*  reasonable market share in the disease? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=382.7s)]
*  For sure, that will be the case. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=384.82s)]
*  The bar is high to say, try to compete head to head with a Eli Lilly, but there are many [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=386.44s)]
*  other paths a smaller company can take. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=393.56s)]
*  You could develop it in a niche indication that's been so far ignored where weight loss [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=396.28s)]
*  would have a significant benefit. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=401.4s)]
*  You could develop specifically for people with sleep apnea or arthritis, or you can [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=403.22s)]
*  simply just be the first with a product that is meaningfully differentiated. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=407.52s)]
*  So if you're the biotech with the first Amlin, you're going to be successful even if you're [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=412.92s)]
*  not Eli Lilly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk about sort of the cost benefits of GLP-1s and how can they reduce the pressure [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=419.12s)]
*  on the overall system? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=425.54s)]
*  The US has this very complicated system where you have list prices, but the actual price [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  is often a significant discount from that list price. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Obesity is one of these areas where there are very big discounts. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=435.88s)]
*  The US net price now is probably somewhere in the $4,000 to $5,000 per year range. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=439.32s)]
*  And that's assuming though you have some insurance coverage. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=446.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=449.8s)]
*  There's a bunch of different ways to look at cost effectiveness. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=450.8s)]
*  There is a cost effectiveness framework called ICER. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=453.8s)]
*  ICER is one of the most biased against placing high value on innovation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=456.48s)]
*  By ICER's analysis, GLP-s are cost effective at $7,500 to $10,000 per year. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=461.76s)]
*  So even on an ICER framework where everything is biased against you, it is cost effective. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=469.2s)]
*  The hugest weakness of ICER is that it doesn't take into account that there's forced genericization [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=475.0s)]
*  for drugs at the end of the life cycle. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=481.8s)]
*  So it kind of assumes that something's going to be at a branded price forever. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  There have been analyses that estimate that when GLP-s are broadly adopted that you'd [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  see a decrease in about $50 billion in food, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=492.88s)]
*  We've started to see some of that on the top line revenues from certain stores. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=497.48s)]
*  People estimate at peak that maybe GLP-s will do $100 to $150 billion in annual sales when [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=502.08s)]
*  they're branded. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=508.04s)]
*  Then you would get a third to half of that back through just a decrease in food, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=509.14s)]
*  There's been studies on consumer willingness to pay. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=514.98s)]
*  And the range depending on income is anywhere from $500 a year to up to where the net price [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=518.2s)]
*  is now about $4,000 a year for people with higher incomes. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=525.76s)]
*  This is the only industry in the world where you have forced substitution by generics after [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=529.88s)]
*  patent expiries. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=537.04s)]
*  OZEMPEC is going to go generic in the not too distant future. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  That's not factored into any of these analyses. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=542.5s)]
*  So the higher income people who are willing to pay are often some of the ones who are [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=544.92s)]
*  not in that obese category. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=548.96s)]
*  Any thoughts on kind of the expansiveness and the appeal that the GLP wants to have? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=551.62s)]
*  And should those people be taking it? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=556.54s)]
*  Are they taking away some of the capacity that should be shared with broader population? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=558.22s)]
*  There are benefits that are not health outcome related, right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=563.54s)]
*  People like how it feels, how it looks. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=569.22s)]
*  If you compare it to other drug classes, when those drugs are broadly available, you see [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=571.94s)]
*  two thirds of people roughly on those drugs who have the underlying condition. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=577.02s)]
*  10, 15 years from now, you could see an even higher proportion of people with obesity and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=581.58s)]
*  type two diabetes on Glypse. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=587.74s)]
*  Because of the increased awareness, the tension around weight, can the GLPs actually inspire [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=590.42s)]
*  us to be a healthier population in the years to come? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=596.62s)]
*  Obesity has been extraordinarily challenging disease. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=600.76s)]
*  We're just at the very beginning of an educational process. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=604.06s)]
*  Now that we have innovations that are super effective and that can make a big dent, we [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=607.92s)]
*  need to say, hey, just like high cholesterol, this is something that you want to treat and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=613.42s)]
*  that will take time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=618.66s)]
*  That's so great to shift the blame and the shame for having the wrong habits. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=619.6999999999999s)]
*  And we got to take the stigma away from it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=623.02s)]
*  And the acceptance of, oh, that's just my lot in life. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=626.14s)]
*  Well, it shouldn't be. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=629.8199999999999s)]
*  You can treat it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=630.8199999999999s)]
*  We're going to talk about how the value of the GOP one market falls into the investor [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=631.82s)]
*  space. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=635.38s)]
*  How big is this going to be? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=636.38s)]
*  This is the first innovation in all of healthcare to create somewhere a little bit north of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=637.5s)]
*  one trillion dollars in value. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=641.58s)]
*  That sounds like a big number, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=643.1400000000001s)]
*  So let's contextualize that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=644.58s)]
*  Walk us through how we get to that number. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=646.46s)]
*  Just over 40 billion people are projecting significant growth consensus is somewhere around [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  a tripling to 125 billion. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=653.22s)]
*  Let's call it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=655.7800000000001s)]
*  Is this innovation worth a trillion dollars? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=656.7800000000001s)]
*  So let's put that in context. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=658.5200000000001s)]
*  Apple is roughly a trillion dollars today. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=660.5799999999999s)]
*  They are a very small proportion of car sales. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  You have Apple, you have Nvidia, you have Microsoft. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=667.26s)]
*  Those are all north of three trillion dollars in value. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  You have Amazon, Google around two trillion and you have Facebook at one and a half trillion. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=673.86s)]
*  Notice some of these huge tech companies are based on very old products, which continue [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=679.9799999999999s)]
*  to drive a major chunk of their value today. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=685.98s)]
*  But they are still charging more today than when they introduced the product. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=689.26s)]
*  The drug industry is super unique. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=693.8199999999999s)]
*  It is the only industry in America that is forced to give up all their revenues on average [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=696.26s)]
*  after 14 years, just like blood pressure drugs and cholesterol drugs. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=702.78s)]
*  So will Glypse be in the future. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=708.64s)]
*  We are on an innovation treadmill where you have to reinvent yourself every 10 to 15 years. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=710.92s)]
*  That's not required of any other innovative industry where you can stack innovations. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=717.9s)]
*  Ten years from now, Eli Lilly and Novo, if they want to stay at one trillion dollars [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=724.22s)]
*  in value, they have to replace their entire business. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=728.76s)]
*  So this is a huge topic. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=732.3s)]
*  We often talk about what it costs to make a drug and why we do pay what we pay and then [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=734.3s)]
*  it's free for future subsequent generations. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=739.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=742.66s)]
*  80% of all prescriptions in America are generics. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=743.66s)]
*  Which is the highest uptake country for generics. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=746.74s)]
*  Anecdotally, I was in London and heard from a friend over there who is getting her GLP-1 [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=749.78s)]
*  prescription from New York. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=756.14s)]
*  Let's talk about what are other countries spending on GLP-1s. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=757.22s)]
*  Other countries are paying less for Glypse and many other medications. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=761.42s)]
*  People most often like to bring up different European countries as the benchmark for America. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=766.38s)]
*  It is absolutely true. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=771.94s)]
*  They are spending less on innovative medicines in general and this has been a trend over [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=773.5s)]
*  the last decade. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=778.46s)]
*  Earlier in my career, pricing in Europe was pretty comparable to the US. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=779.94s)]
*  That's not true anymore. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=783.58s)]
*  So today, drug companies will typically prioritize America first. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=784.66s)]
*  Germany is then close behind that because they are still willing to pay. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=788.82s)]
*  What used to be many of the other European countries has now shifted to Japan. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=793.06s)]
*  China is paying much more for innovation than they used to. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=798.7s)]
*  And even certain Latin American and Middle Eastern countries. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=802.1400000000001s)]
*  When you don't pay top dollar for innovation, there are consequences to access and timing [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=806.4200000000001s)]
*  of that access. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=811.98s)]
*  Especially for something like Glypse, when you do have these manufacturing constraints [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=813.62s)]
*  where people have to make choices for who's going to get the drug first. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think your anecdote just kind of brings it home. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=822.08s)]
*  The UK is a perfect example. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=824.7s)]
*  They've had extra challenges compared to other European countries because of Brexit. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=826.5s)]
*  Economic growth hasn't been great. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=831.82s)]
*  When you're in that situation, you're going to invest less in healthcare for your people. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=833.14s)]
*  Which is such a shame. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=837.4s)]
*  And this is something that we work on. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=838.4s)]
*  As you know, we have a presence in the UK and we have people on the ground there and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=839.98s)]
*  we have deep ties to a lot of extraordinary scientific minds, but have also gotten involved [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=844.06s)]
*  in some of the more governmental and regulatory bodies that are thinking about how do we improve [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=849.82s)]
*  the conditions to bring more capital here? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=854.86s)]
*  Yeah, if you have prosperity, then these very challenging questions of how do you allocate [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=857.38s)]
*  your resources, how do you split that prosperity pie is much less challenging. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=863.02s)]
*  Let's talk about all of the wonderful value that we think the GLP ones are going to create. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=868.52s)]
*  How does that get redeployed? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=873.18s)]
*  Where does that money go? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=875.42s)]
*  We have a trillion now for obesity. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=876.42s)]
*  That's roughly now a third of the large multinational pharmas. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=879.22s)]
*  We're guesstimating a roughly 30% increase in industry cash flow because of GLIPS. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=884.06s)]
*  That's the biggest absolute dollar increase that we've ever seen. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=889.5s)]
*  $50 billion plus per year in new cash flow. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=892.8199999999999s)]
*  And the question is, where is that going to go? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=896.4599999999999s)]
*  A decent chunk will go into iterative innovation. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=898.42s)]
*  There is still significant unmet need to be filled. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=902.54s)]
*  That's at least three waves of incremental innovation until you have a menu of obesity [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=905.92s)]
*  products that can fulfill everyone's ideal. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=912.16s)]
*  That alone should bode very well for the sector more broadly because certainly acquisitions [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=915.88s)]
*  and the money that comes out of those cash flows are used for much needed stabilization [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=921.6s)]
*  of the sector. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=926.6s)]
*  And that's $100 to $150 billion of money that comes into the space. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=927.6s)]
*  If that could grow by another $50 billion, that would be. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=934.38s)]
*  With a third of the pharmas now going after obesity, half of them are doing it by acquisition [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=935.38s)]
*  or licensing. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=941.04s)]
*  So that's how some of that cash flow is going to be deployed. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=942.12s)]
*  Small companies, private companies will benefit. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=946.02s)]
*  Another chunk of that capital will go into diversification. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=948.36s)]
*  There's a never ending list of diseases that have significant unmet needs. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=951.88s)]
*  And some of that capital will go towards that, which will be a great boost for the space. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=957.04s)]
*  We're in this golden age of innovation in drug development. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=961.6s)]
*  The number two killer after cardiovascular disease is still cancer. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=965.44s)]
*  Obesity has been a major area where we've seen tremendous progress. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=969.84s)]
*  Several big companies are actually expanding into the GLP-1, the obesity and the metabolic [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=973.84s)]
*  space. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=978.44s)]
*  Do you expect to see those guys emerge as legitimate players? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=979.44s)]
*  I definitely do. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=983.6s)]
*  Amgen is a good example. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=985.2800000000001s)]
*  They're trying to enter the market with something that decreases the frequency of injection. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  To a month, Roche and Pfizer have been chasing a pill. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=991.52s)]
*  That will be great for patients' choice and preference. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=995.36s)]
*  What does that do for the compounding pharmacies? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=999.72s)]
*  Is this their moment in the sun and they should take advantage of it? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  The trend in general has been higher quality standards in the US from the regulators. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1005.28s)]
*  The idea that you would allow a non-approved, non-inspected manufacturer sell directly to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1012.16s)]
*  consumers for a disease that people are not dying tomorrow. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1019.96s)]
*  It is a dangerous thing. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1024.04s)]
*  There is such a strong unmet need and demand from patients. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1025.76s)]
*  But once those supply issues are resolved, compounders are going to go away. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1031.4s)]
*  What happens in eight years when Ozempic goes off patent? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1036.04s)]
*  Whatever product goes generic, that product would normally rapidly lose market share. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1039.64s)]
*  That's where you have substitution when you pick up your drugs at the pharmacy. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1044.08s)]
*  80, 90% of volume disappears basically within one to two months. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1047.36s)]
*  Other products that haven't gone generic, let's say your Monjaro or ZetBound, those [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  would typically keep the market share that they have at that time. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1056.9599999999998s)]
*  The growth might slow a little bit. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1060.32s)]
*  It depends on how differentiated that branded product is. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1062.48s)]
*  When Ozempic does go generic, you would expect you would have pills on the market, then you [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1066.52s)]
*  would have other injectable options. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1071.8s)]
*  Some that are more potent, some that are more convenient. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1074.26s)]
*  Manufacturing is really difficult because these are peptides and peptides are expensive [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1077.24s)]
*  to make and the investment to build out the manufacturing plants are really, really large [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1081.68s)]
*  dollar numbers. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1087.76s)]
*  Maybe the price doesn't drop as much because you have to invest tens of billions of dollars [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1089.0s)]
*  to make these manufacturing facilities. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1093.48s)]
*  Some products get to the point where you have really, really safe, really convenient drugs [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1096.24s)]
*  like allergy medications. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1101.52s)]
*  If you had a pill that was like that, you could also actually shift to an over-the-counter [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1104.12s)]
*  market. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1109.7199999999998s)]
*  Then oftentimes, brands can protect more of the business at a lower price point. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1110.7199999999998s)]
*  How much time are you spending personally looking at all the data? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1116.32s)]
*  How much time is your team committing to following all the companies out there? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1119.6399999999999s)]
*  It's going to remain the number one opportunity until that unmet need is filled, which is [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1123.7199999999998s)]
*  going to take over a decade and multiple waves of innovation. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1128.32s)]
*  If you start from that, then we need to be on top of this. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1133.34s)]
*  You're dedicating resources, a lot of manpower and hours spent. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1138.0s)]
*  Why don't you talk about some of the investments that you made and what are you most excited [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1141.22s)]
*  about? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1144.58s)]
*  There needs to be more promising private companies that can become those next promising public [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1145.58s)]
*  companies. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1150.34s)]
*  It makes sense that a significant amount of the opportunity would be to invest in private [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1151.34s)]
*  companies or create private companies. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1154.9399999999998s)]
*  Kylara is really an example of that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1156.9399999999998s)]
*  This is a company where we have in-licensed products in development and the initial clinical [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1160.3s)]
*  data looks very, very promising. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1165.5s)]
*  They look like they could have a shot to be a best-in-class injectable clip, and they [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1168.1s)]
*  also have a small molecule in the portfolio. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1172.86s)]
*  You don't have to wait five years for it to be ready to be a public company. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1176.06s)]
*  It could be ready very, very soon because the data suggests that it has competitive [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1180.3799999999999s)]
*  products. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1184.94s)]
*  That's just the first of these company creations for us in the space. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1186.18s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGRmMy9cHSc&t=1190.14s)]
