# Revolutionizing RNA therapeutics - Avidity Biosciences
**The RTW Podcast:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc)
*  We could not just change the lives of people living with myotony dystrophy, but we could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=0.0s)]
*  actually change the whole RNA field. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=7.48s)]
*  That's pretty ambitious. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=10.64s)]
*  Welcome to the RTW podcast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=13.56s)]
*  I'm your guest host, Peter Tipertum Suwan, managing director and research analyst on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=15.64s)]
*  the RTW asset selection team. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=20.72s)]
*  Today I have the privilege of speaking to Sarah Boyce, president and CEO of Avidity [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=23.36s)]
*  Biosciences, a company that is revolutionizing the delivery of RNA therapeutics for patients [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=28.4s)]
*  living with debilitating, rare genetic conditions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Over five years, Sarah transformed Avidity into a publicly traded leading genetic medicines [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=38.12s)]
*  company with three neuromuscular programs in late-stage clinical development. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=43.72s)]
*  Before that, Sarah was the president of Axia Therapeutics, where she led the commercialization [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  of oligonucleotide therapies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Sarah, it's great to have you here in New York at RTW's headquarters. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=57.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for crossing the country to join us today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=62.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  And it's a pleasure to be here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  Our audience know a lot about what you do and what Avidity does, but can you tell us [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  a little bit more about Avidity's value proposition? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=74.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=77.6s)]
*  Avidity, we're trying to do two things. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=78.6s)]
*  One is to revolutionize the RNA space and two is to make a profound impact in people's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=80.96s)]
*  lives. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=87.44s)]
*  We have cracked and solved the challenge of delivery of cells and tissue types outside [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=88.72s)]
*  of the liver. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=96.08s)]
*  Our first franchise is skeletal muscle, where we now have three programs in the clinic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=97.08s)]
*  Two of those programs are for large rare diseases, population sizes of 30 to 40,000 people living [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=102.56s)]
*  with those diseases in the U.S. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=109.76s)]
*  We did it for myotonic dystrophy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=111.56s)]
*  We've done the same thing for FSHD. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  You really show when you understand biology, you can engage a target with an siRNA and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=116.92s)]
*  all the dots connect together from delivery to being able to engage your genetic target [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=123.64s)]
*  to then being able to see functional changes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=130.24s)]
*  We have a franchise in precision cardiology and essentially we are leading the field. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=133.24s)]
*  We think that you are an optimistic person and you're incredibly savvy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=139.2s)]
*  What convinced you to join the team and lead Avidity? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  There was part of me going, what? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=147.28s)]
*  They can deliver RNA to muscle cells. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  No one can do that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=151.8s)]
*  So I was intrigued. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=153.04s)]
*  At that point, Avidity was private. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=154.04s)]
*  We were 20 something people, preclinical. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=156.48s)]
*  I met with Troy Wilson and he was like, we'll spend time with Art and see the data. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=159.44s)]
*  Art and I had this very clandestine meeting because San Diego is a very small community. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=165.32s)]
*  We were inside this golf club to make sure no one saw us and he took me through the data. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=169.96s)]
*  I was like, so you're using an antibody. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=175.08s)]
*  Why has no one thought of that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=178.48s)]
*  We all know antibodies are great at targeting certain cells. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=180.12s)]
*  I've worked at platform technology companies previously and know that one of the great [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=183.8s)]
*  things is when you understand your safety really well, you know how to translate that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=189.16s)]
*  from one program to another. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=192.72s)]
*  What were some of the biggest concerns at the time? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=195.16s)]
*  Most of my experience is in late stage development, commercialization, building global companies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=198.24s)]
*  Art tells the story. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=206.4s)]
*  I hope he sat in his office and he showed me the phase one design. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=207.4s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but that's great. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=209.92s)]
*  But what indication are we going for and what's our target label and what's going to be our [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=211.0s)]
*  phase three design and what does that look like? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=216.44s)]
*  I actually went home to my husband that afternoon and went, I don't know how it's happened, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=219.28s)]
*  but the perfect CEO role for me just presented itself in front of my feet. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=225.84s)]
*  I'm incredibly grateful for Troy and Art for the faith and trust in me. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=233.72s)]
*  One of the things that stood out to me and others working to finance the company at the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=239.0s)]
*  time was the overhang of the Ionis data with their first generation DM1 oligo. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  That didn't quite pan out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  Was that ever a consideration when taking this role? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=257.24s)]
*  Certainly the early data helped connect the dots, but the fundamental challenge was not [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=262.0s)]
*  being able to get enough RNA into the cell. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  I remember feeling that what we had at Abidity was the answer. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=271.96s)]
*  I also knew from that experience as to how incredible the myotonic dystrophy community [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=276.64s)]
*  is and how engaged they are and the key opinion leaders around it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  I know how big the medical need is and also understanding what was the fundamental problem. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Challenge was getting siRNAs into muscle cells, which on the non-human primate data, I mean, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=295.56s)]
*  it was so clear. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=300.8s)]
*  It's perfect for an siRNA approach. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=301.8s)]
*  It didn't matter what muscle was looked at. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=306.24s)]
*  It was just obvious the potential here that we could open up the whole space. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=308.64s)]
*  That said, drug development is never a straight line. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=313.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  You know that super, super well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  Following the first DM1 readout, you had the second readout. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=320.76s)]
*  The FDA also surprised you with a partial clinical hold. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=324.96s)]
*  And a lot of people said, look, the second data cut was less than convincing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=330.76s)]
*  It must have been an incredibly tough time for you and the team. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=336.5s)]
*  Help us understand what was going through your mind at the time and how did you navigate [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=341.24s)]
*  these challenges? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=346.28s)]
*  There was no question in our mind at any point. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=347.28s)]
*  We have a drug that can really help people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  I've seen all sorts of things happen over my career. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=353.56s)]
*  I've seen drugs get withdrawn. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=355.56s)]
*  I've had CRLs. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  We know how to work through this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=359.12s)]
*  That as a CEO is probably where you get really tested and you show what you're made of. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  You've got to lead a group of people. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=366.24s)]
*  We also knew this is going to take time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=367.6s)]
*  The data is going to mature. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=369.68s)]
*  Everyone's continuing to receive drug. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  We know what we're hearing from the sites. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  And then it's engaging with the FDA to communicate, to advocate for patients and work that through. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=375.6s)]
*  We saw the open label extension data. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=381.84s)]
*  We've negotiated a really efficient phase three design. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  That study's now open and enrolling. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=388.84s)]
*  But in biotech, if you expect it to all be sunshine and roses, you're in the wrong business. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=391.52s)]
*  Up until that point, the wind was in our sails and it was almost a year we needed to have. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=396.32s)]
*  It actually made us a stronger organization. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  A lot of people, perhaps investors included, were giving you unfulicited advice. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=404.92s)]
*  Maybe give us a behind the scenes look of which ones you found the most useful. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=412.08s)]
*  I'm a great believer in the importance of listening. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=416.0s)]
*  When someone gives you advice and they're generous enough to do that, some of it you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=419.08s)]
*  choose to take, some of it you choose not to. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=423.68s)]
*  There was some advice around, oh, you need to focus on other programs. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=426.44s)]
*  And that we very much kept to our plan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  One person who was pretty important was one of our board members, Tamar Thompson, who [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=434.48s)]
*  is the head of market access and global policy at Alexion. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=439.8s)]
*  She brought a different perspective around you need to start networking with some of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=444.04s)]
*  the rare disease advocates within the FDA, within the biotech community. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=449.24s)]
*  And that was great advice. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=454.44s)]
*  Something like a partial clinical hold and where a data readout isn't as seen as the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=456.36s)]
*  world as you think it is. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  You have to also maintain your reputation. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=461.68s)]
*  You can't be seen as not being clear or trying to hide things. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=463.6s)]
*  I remember when the news broke, we went to work. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=468.92s)]
*  We did all the research we could and we felt pretty comfortable talking to you as well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  We went so deep. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=478.72s)]
*  I mean, I think we went pretty deep together. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  We did. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  We dove in. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  We had every advisor you could possibly think of from different areas of expertise to make [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  sure that we did. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=491.6s)]
*  When you see it in the way we do our science, we always go really, really deep. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=492.96s)]
*  You mentioned the advice from your board member about working with the advocacy group, understanding [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  the disease in a deep way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  And that led you to getting VHOD as a primary endpoint for your phase three trial. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=505.76s)]
*  That was a huge and valiant inflection point for Aveda as well. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  So congratulations. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  How would you describe the direction of the FDA on the efficient registration of path [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=518.12s)]
*  now for not just your disease, but many? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=524.0s)]
*  Some really positive progress that we've seen recently. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=526.84s)]
*  The proposal around platform technologies and then also just looking at rare diseases. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=530.0s)]
*  And one of the challenges at the moment is that there's different approaches between [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=536.32s)]
*  two centers. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=542.12s)]
*  We submit our VLA to CEDA. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=543.38s)]
*  So we're reviewed under CEDA. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=545.2s)]
*  But there are multiple examples of where you see CBA leaning into accelerated approaches [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=547.16s)]
*  and CEDA being more traditional. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  There's an example at the moment in a space that we're not in where there's two drugs, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  one's in CBA, one's in CEDA. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=559.8s)]
*  The time to market it is going to be a year different and it shouldn't be. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=561.76s)]
*  And for a patient living with a rare disease, that's simply not right. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=566.68s)]
*  We've seen the FDA recognize this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=570.76s)]
*  We've also seen this get attention on the Hill. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=573.64s)]
*  There's appropriations language that's through Congress and Senate around the importance [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=577.24s)]
*  of having a consistent approach. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=581.76s)]
*  We still have a long way to go, but I think the recognition of some of the challenges [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=584.32s)]
*  is there. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  The desire to get drugs to people living with rare diseases quicker is there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  Us and others partnering with the FDA as the Rare Disease Center becomes established to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  help make that successful. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=600.2s)]
*  The other area that I think is also really interesting and exciting for us as a platform [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=603.04s)]
*  company is the potential for platform technologies where you can leverage one program to another. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=607.52s)]
*  I feel a lot more optimistic for the rare disease community in general than I did a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  year ago. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=620.4s)]
*  For Avidity, we have the drugs that we're working on, but I want to see the whole community [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=621.4s)]
*  do better. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=626.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  You paved the way for other companies developing DM1 products too. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  Being a genetic medicines investor, I'm really grateful for the work that you did, especially [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=634.36s)]
*  on VHON, because now other rare diseases are benefiting from it too. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=641.52s)]
*  And I say this all the time, that this is the year of genetic medicines. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=646.12s)]
*  Like, I'm serious. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=651.04s)]
*  So let's knock on wood for that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=651.76s)]
*  I would say we're just getting started. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=654.72s)]
*  Maybe it's the decade. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=656.68s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=657.68s)]
*  When we were building our clinical trial design and negotiating that design, we were actually [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=658.68s)]
*  very conscious around this is opening up a space. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=663.88s)]
*  And if you look at the work that Surrepta pioneered in DMD, they opened up that space. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  It was really important for delgiserone, but also for myotonic dystrophy to be able to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  negotiate a clinical trial design that is pretty straightforward. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=680.2399999999999s)]
*  VHON is the primary, the key secondary is our hand grip, quantitative muscles, strength [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=685.08s)]
*  testing, and DM1 active, which is your quality of life endpoint, which together gives a really [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=690.76s)]
*  good package. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=696.76s)]
*  The other key was being able to achieve that we can submit at 30 weeks. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=698.16s)]
*  It's a full approval strategy with this real acceleration opportunity. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=702.36s)]
*  And it's a pretty simple, straightforward phase three. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  This is about the myotonic dystrophy community and the foundation couldn't be more excited [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  with the design that we were able to negotiate. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe let's touch on FSHD. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  Last June, you delivered a highly anticipated data set from FORTITUDE, which is a phase [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=721.96s)]
*  one to trial for FSHD. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  Can you summarize for our audience what you saw? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=731.36s)]
*  Yeah, we were doing something that no one had ever done before. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=733.96s)]
*  We were the first drug to go into the clinic that directly targeted the underlying cause [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=737.84s)]
*  of the disease, which is the aberrant expression of Dux4. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=744.0s)]
*  Perfect for an siRNA approach. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=748.08s)]
*  What we saw in that data was this beautiful connecting of the dots from delivery to muscle [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=751.36s)]
*  cells to then we looked at the downstream genes of the Dux4 regulated genes where we [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=758.6s)]
*  do bulk RNA-seq and the types of genes that are involved in inflammation or cellular apoptosis. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=765.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's where you can start to see the whole cascade. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  We identified a circulating biomarker that was two years of work to be able to do that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=775.44s)]
*  And that is really important when it comes to our dose selection and dose interval. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=780.72s)]
*  We saw changes in circulating CK that we know is a marker of muscle damage. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  And then we saw signs of functional improvement even at a four-month point as we thought it [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=791.48s)]
*  was going to take 12 months to see signs of functional change. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  It was just a great example of when science does what you think it's going to do. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=799.2s)]
*  It was just a really beautiful data set when you see everything line up. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=803.6s)]
*  When you look at the Reachable Workspace data, what does that mean for patients? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=810.2s)]
*  I think on Reachable Workspace, we've got education work to do as a company and then as the community [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=818.2s)]
*  around that and around why it's important and what it means. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=824.2800000000001s)]
*  And Reachable Workspace is actually a very well-developed mechanism of measuring how [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=828.0400000000001s)]
*  someone can move their arm. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=834.12s)]
*  One of the patient advocates, Amy Becquia, she is the head of the local chapter in San Diego. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=835.72s)]
*  When I first met Amy, she was painting. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=841.6400000000001s)]
*  She had to give up painting because she was unable to position the brush anymore. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=844.52s)]
*  If you can't lift your arm past your shoulder, there's a lot of things that you cannot do. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=849.56s)]
*  Cleaning your teeth becomes something where you have to take a very specific position [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=856.6s)]
*  or wash your hair to be able to lift something up or get something out of a cupboard. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you were very intentional with naming the FSHT trial Fortunitude. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=867.3199999999999s)]
*  When I thought about the FSHT readout and the way it was named, I felt like you picked [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=873.24s)]
*  an incredibly meaningful word to describe the plight of people living with FSHT. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=879.5600000000001s)]
*  So tell us, what was the genesis of doing that? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  What hope does it bring to the patients? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=889.16s)]
*  The aspect around it was if you could use a word to describe the FSHT community. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=891.88s)]
*  Fortitude was almost like a signature of the community. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=899.4s)]
*  FSHT typically affects people in their 20s and 30s. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  So in the time of your life when you believe you're invincible and you know what you should be, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=909.4s)]
*  and then you sort of get impacted by something like FSHT, but there's incredible strength and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=914.68s)]
*  courage and people could not be more excited. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=920.76s)]
*  The FSHT society themselves are very intentional in working on how do we get more people [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=925.48s)]
*  genetically diagnosed. As a community, they're now preparing for drugs to be available. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  Hope is a powerful thing and I think we've brought tremendous hope to the community. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=937.16s)]
*  And you also recently talked about the trial design moving forward. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=943.72s)]
*  It is accelerated, incredibly savvy for the team to come up with something like that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=950.76s)]
*  Maybe talk through the strategy to move the program forward. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=957.0s)]
*  The data is so clear. And for us, it's like, how can we do this as fast as possible? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=962.0400000000001s)]
*  We have the circulating biomarkers, we have the Plasmid CK. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=967.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like we can build a very compelling biomarker strategy here. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=971.08s)]
*  The Fortitude study was always designed to be the umbrella and to add cohorts to that study. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=975.16s)]
*  That actually allows us to be incredibly efficient enrolling patients in the study. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=981.88s)]
*  There's cohort C and cohort D. Cohort C, as you say, is a biomarker cohort [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=986.04s)]
*  that is being designed as an accelerated approval strategy. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=991.56s)]
*  It's also where you see us really leaning in as a company. We have a really strong balance sheet. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=996.52s)]
*  That study, in all likelihood, will be started before we've actually got the regulatory agreement. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1001.56s)]
*  We expect it will enroll pretty quickly. And then there's a job of negotiating that along the way. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1007.4s)]
*  But also at the same time, we've added a fourth cohort, which is cohort D. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1013.88s)]
*  That is a functional study. There will be no muscle biopsies in that study. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1018.92s)]
*  They will use the circulating biomarker and that will be designed for full approval. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1022.52s)]
*  And we're looking to initiate that in the first half of next year. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1028.36s)]
*  If we're in a situation where the FDA says no, or they say maybe, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1032.2s)]
*  we're going to go back again when we have data, of course. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1037.8799999999999s)]
*  And if there's a situation where the FDA still says no, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1041.08s)]
*  we didn't waste any time starting the functional study. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1045.48s)]
*  And we can also be able to use the patients from cohort C to add to the functional study. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1048.36s)]
*  It's an overall acceleration strategy, but it has this turbo charge, which is the biomarker cohort. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1054.36s)]
*  Now with both DM1 and FSHD in very promising positions, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1061.3999999999999s)]
*  you've also raised a strong balance sheet. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1068.04s)]
*  Why do you think having the amount of cash you do now is important to you? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1071.56s)]
*  Bottom line, we have a lot of work to do. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1076.36s)]
*  And that balance sheet enabled us to do what we did for FSHD. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1078.28s)]
*  We have data coming up this quarter for DMD as well. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1082.44s)]
*  But it's also part of building our global organization, building our commercial team. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1087.8s)]
*  We're pretty deep into that now. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1094.04s)]
*  That gives us a lot of strength in our overall position as a company. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1096.28s)]
*  So what's next for Vidity? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1101.16s)]
*  As a team, we're most excited about the potential of how many people's lives we can change. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1103.48s)]
*  In terms of five years from now, we're looking at a global commercial organization [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1109.8000000000002s)]
*  that has launched and is continuing to launch drugs that are opening up new spaces. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1116.0400000000002s)]
*  And we're in some large rare disease indications. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1122.76s)]
*  As a company, we're looking to open up more and more new spaces. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1125.0800000000002s)]
*  If you look at precision cardiology, that is what we found. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  Underlined genetic diseases that are ideal for an RNA approach. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1133.5600000000002s)]
*  No one's been able to deliver to the heart. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1138.04s)]
*  Simple gain-of-function mutations. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1140.2s)]
*  I'm really excited about what we can do there and working with our partner, BMS, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1142.92s)]
*  on the genetic targets that we have with them. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1147.72s)]
*  To actually be starting that work of fundamentally changing what happens in a cardiologist's office. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1150.68s)]
*  That's like changing the practice of medicine. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1156.76s)]
*  And in terms of our research organization, it's incredibly efficient. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1159.48s)]
*  We also, as you know, are very purposeful and intentional about the words we use. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1164.28s)]
*  When we did our vision, it's simply we're revolutionizing the RNA space. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1168.76s)]
*  We never said we were a muscle company. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1174.84s)]
*  We never said we were a heart company. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1176.52s)]
*  We never limited ourselves like that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1178.6000000000001s)]
*  Nor did we ever say we were an AOC company. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1180.52s)]
*  We've said we are an RNA company. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1183.08s)]
*  Sometimes you find that companies fall in love with what they have and they kind of stand still [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1185.64s)]
*  and others come around them. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1191.32s)]
*  And for several years now, we've been working to make sure that does not happen. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1193.24s)]
*  At its core, if you can make a profound impact on people's lives the way we can, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1198.04s)]
*  you know that's building an incredibly important company in our industry. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1204.6s)]
*  A little bit more about you as a CEO. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1209.48s)]
*  You represent other women in this position. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1213.16s)]
*  What does it mean to you when other people look up to you and want to do what you do? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1218.04s)]
*  I'm one of not many women who are CEOs of companies with market caps of $5 billion plus. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1223.88s)]
*  I think it's less than 10. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1230.04s)]
*  And I know that part of what is my responsibility is to be a cheerleader and a champion, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1232.44s)]
*  both internally with in a biddy, but also within the industry. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1242.44s)]
*  I'm involved in a group called the Biotech Sisterhood. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1247.16s)]
*  It was started by Sheila Gujarati, Angie Yu and Julie Owens. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1250.76s)]
*  It's one of the most powerful networks I've ever been involved in. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1255.1599999999999s)]
*  There are 278 female biotech CEOs in that network. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1259.24s)]
*  The only entry criteria is you're a female CEO [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1264.04s)]
*  and you're motivated to lift up and support other women. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1267.96s)]
*  It's one of my greatest joys in being part of that community [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1271.72s)]
*  and really supporting cheering people on when good things happen. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1275.64s)]
*  And when this is biotech, it's not a straight line. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1280.3600000000001s)]
*  Also being the when that doesn't happen for someone as well. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1284.0400000000002s)]
*  If I can offer some advice that may be helpful for someone, then I make sure I do that. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1287.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, Sarah, thank you so much for speaking with us today. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1294.92s)]
*  You're welcome. It's been a pleasure. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1298.2800000000002s)]
*  And thank you for inviting me. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1299.88s)]
*  The RTW podcast was produced by me, Devon Lever, at the RTW headquarters in New York, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1301.4s)]
*  with technical director Joseph Sebring and edited by Dominique Guerra. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1307.72s)]
*  This interview and testimonial was given by Sarah Boyce, CEO of Avidity Biosciences, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1312.3600000000001s)]
*  a company in which RTW has made an equity investment on behalf of its managed funds. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1318.28s)]
*  No compensation was provided to Ms. Boyce. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvM-qzCblwc&t=1323.96s)]
