# Changing Minds: Psychedelics as Legitimate Medicine
**The RTW Podcast:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ)
*  Welcome to the RTW podcast. I'm your guest host, Stephanie Sirota, partner and chief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=0.0s)]
*  business officer, leading the strategic partnerships team at RTW Investments. Today, I'm speaking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=6.48s)]
*  with Connor Williams, senior research analyst at RTW responsible for research in neurological [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=12.22s)]
*  disease. Connor, thanks for being with us today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=17.92s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=20.36s)]
*  The earliest written accounts of depression date back to Mesopotamia when it was thought [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=21.84s)]
*  that depression was caused by demons. Then the ancient Greeks and Romans thought it was [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=26.0s)]
*  both biological and psychological. They prescribed exercise, diet, baths, massage, music, and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=30.52s)]
*  medication. Now they might have been on to something, but as we know, holistic therapies [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=37.6s)]
*  are especially tough to ensure compliance from the patient. So it's down really to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=42.0s)]
*  the efficacy of the drugs. Most people today think about depression emerging on the scene [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=47.32s)]
*  as a disease with the advent of breakthrough pharmaceuticals in the mid 20th century with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=53.3s)]
*  the Maui monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Let me just test your history here. Tell us about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=58.54s)]
*  that class of drugs. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=64.94s)]
*  Yeah, what's actually really cool about any drug that affects the brain is a lot of them [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=66.58s)]
*  are discovered by serendipity. So the first antidepressant was actually being developed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=71.28s)]
*  as a drug to treat tuberculosis. And they found in the patients they gave it to that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=77.1s)]
*  had this surprising effect on mood. And that was the first monoamine oxidase inhibitor. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=81.89999999999999s)]
*  And that started this kind of snowball where the monoamine oxidase inhibitors led to tricyclics [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=87.86s)]
*  and then led to this class of drugs SSRIs, which have been the mainstay of antidepressant [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=95.74s)]
*  therapy for decades. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=101.1s)]
*  Prozac was developed by Eli Lilly and it was the most prescribed antidepressant because [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=103.02s)]
*  it worked and it had this relatively clean side effect profile. But then it feels like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=107.3s)]
*  there has been a desert of innovation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=113.42s)]
*  Psychopharmacology is this constant series of booms and then busts. So you had the 1950s [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=117.62s)]
*  and 60s where you first start getting psychopharmacological medicines. You had this explosion in all these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=122.78s)]
*  different drugs over the ensuing decades where we went from monoamine oxidase inhibitors [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=129.18s)]
*  to again tricyclics and then SSRIs. There's Prozac, which is fluoxetine, and Celexa, which [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=134.26000000000002s)]
*  is citalopram. Then it's successor drug Lexapro. SSRIs, they ultimately all work the same way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=140.22s)]
*  They're selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. If you're a patient that either doesn't respond [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=146.34s)]
*  to an SSRI, which happens all the time, we have millions of people that are treatment [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=151.5s)]
*  resistant in the US, or you're a patient that gets unacceptable adverse events on an [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=156.18s)]
*  SSRI, you're kind of out of luck. It became a situation where patients weren't getting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=161.78s)]
*  any better as we made more and more drugs. Payers and physicians kind of caught on and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=166.46s)]
*  they said, you know, why am I going to prescribe this branded drug that works just the same [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=170.9s)]
*  way as this generic drug? Am I really going to jump through all these insurance hoops [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  to get a drug that's the same? And the answer was no. And so what was a blockbuster market, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=179.78s)]
*  every drug was a multi-billion dollar drug. You now have kind of these last straggler [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=186.06s)]
*  drugs that exist and they haven't even crossed a billion dollars. As farmers were more risk [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=190.58s)]
*  averse in psychiatry because they couldn't figure out anything else that worked, they [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=195.38000000000002s)]
*  exited the space. And so you had this period of time where nothing was really being made [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=198.9s)]
*  until biotech started stepping in to kind of pick up where pharma left off. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=203.94s)]
*  When you say treatment resistant patients, does your research extend to patient populations [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=208.9s)]
*  globally? If you fail two adequate lines of antidepressants, you're said to be treatment [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=213.62s)]
*  resistant. Your odds of getting better once you're treatment resistant go down markedly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=219.46s)]
*  In the U.S. treatment resistant depression is a defined term and there are now different [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=224.9s)]
*  med tech approaches and new pharmacotherapies to treat that. Outside the U.S. it's often hard for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=229.62s)]
*  new psychiatric drugs to get to market. Because of the strict payment regimes? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=235.38s)]
*  Right. In Europe, the governments would prefer to give patients cheaper generic drugs. You see [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  all the time in psychiatry that drugs just don't get to market in Europe. There's a drug called [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=245.14s)]
*  Nuprazid which treats Parkinson's disease psychosis and it's available in the U.S. but it was never [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=251.94s)]
*  brought to Europe and it sets up this strange scenario where the only other drugs we can use [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  for Parkinson's disease psychosis are atypical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=263.06s)]
*  increase mortality by a significant margin. So in Europe, these patients with no other option [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=268.74s)]
*  are being given antipsychotics because they're cheap but it's not actually the best outcome for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=274.5s)]
*  these patients. Some of the med tech solutions like TMS and ECT, can you talk a little bit about those? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=279.7s)]
*  You might think that, oh it's infrequent that people don't respond to antidepressants but it's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=286.9s)]
*  actually quite common. There are probably two million people in the U.S. with treatment resistant [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=291.7s)]
*  depression. You can go to a psychiatrist and oftentimes they'll give you certain medical [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=296.02s)]
*  devices that treat your depression. TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation lets out a magnetic [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=302.1s)]
*  field which then causes electrical stimulation in your brain. It's very analogous to an older [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  technology called electroconvulsive therapy or ECT. That sounds scary. It's what you think of in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=312.82000000000005s)]
*  horror movies. You think of someone in a psychiatric ward electrocuting a patient and making them [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=320.18s)]
*  functionally a zombie. Even though there's massive stigma around it, it's probably the most effective [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=326.66s)]
*  antidepressant therapy we have. And there are so many stories out there of patients with treatment [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  resistant depression who will take a course of ECT and their lives will be changed. Even if it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=337.22s)]
*  wasn't underutilized, we have two million treatment resistant patients in the U.S. We couldn't possibly [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=342.82000000000005s)]
*  be giving ECT to all of them. Clearly there is a need for new drugs. J&J's Spravato ascetamine drug [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=348.5s)]
*  came on the scene. It's a nasally administered drug. I think people are just interested in that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=355.7s)]
*  it's ketamine or a form of it. So Spravato, it's actually S-ketamine. In the same way, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=360.82s)]
*  Johnson & Johnson didn't develop ketamine because that's a very old compound. It would have been [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=366.82s)]
*  very hard to get any exclusivity around it. And instead they developed an enantiomer that they [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=371.86s)]
*  say has better properties. It was one of the first drugs for treatment resistant depression. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=377.7s)]
*  Patients take this nasal spray in a clinic. It is a way for giving relief to these patients that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=382.34s)]
*  really had no other option. That drug's just passed doing a billion dollars a year in sales and it's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=387.53999999999996s)]
*  probably on track to be a multi-billion dollar blockbuster in interventional psychiatry. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=393.46s)]
*  Is Spravato a psychedelic drug? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=399.05999999999995s)]
*  Ketamine mostly works as an NMDA antagonist. So it's more of a dissociative anesthetic, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=401.29999999999995s)]
*  even though people think of it as a psychedelic because of its psychotomimetic properties. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=407.14s)]
*  How SSRIs and the psychedelics historically been manufactured? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=412.02s)]
*  They're found in nature all the time. You have, you know, peyote cactus that contains mescaline. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=417.14s)]
*  Obviously psilocybin is produced by magic mushrooms. And you even have toads in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=422.82s)]
*  Sonoran Desert that make 5-methoxy DMT and all sorts of naturally occurring psychedelic compounds [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  that are out there. In the 1960s you had people like Timothy Leary advocating for them, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=436.26s)]
*  studying them. Eventually he got pushed out of Harvard as a consequence of his research, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=442.02s)]
*  but then he became part of the counterculture. Now of course that had downstream consequences [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=446.82s)]
*  where these drugs became outlawed and that became really hard to study the effects of psychedelics. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=451.7s)]
*  So you had this dark age in psychedelic research. There were very few studies between the 1970s [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=457.3s)]
*  and kind of the early 90s because it was so hard to get around restrictive scheduling laws. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=463.62s)]
*  And you had a dark age in innovation after the end of the incrementally beneficial SSRI drugs. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=468.74s)]
*  You have this perfect storm for no new psychiatric drugs and the compounds that maybe have promise [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=476.5s)]
*  you're not allowed to study. When did this sort of whole sector go from something that was part of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=484.74s)]
*  a counterculture, a removal to actually a legitimate class of drugs that was worthy of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=491.06s)]
*  your attention? In psychiatry, people will show us open label data and it can be hard to tell [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=497.22s)]
*  that it's real, but with psychedelics the effect size was so enormous it was very hard for people [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=503.3s)]
*  to ignore. As the war on drugs started to die down, you had certain academic groups at NYU and in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=511.54s)]
*  other places that started studying magic mushrooms also out of Imperial College London. And they'd [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=518.5s)]
*  find in these very early often open label studies that the effects on depression of particularly [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=525.14s)]
*  psilocybin, which was most studied at the time, were profound and they were very much outside the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=532.02s)]
*  range of what you'd expect for a placebo. What really started the snowball began with drugs like [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=538.58s)]
*  as well as another drug called epidilex and these are both scheduled substance. In the case of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=545.38s)]
*  epidilex, it's cannabidiol and of course for subravado it's ketamine. What Johnson & Johnson [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=550.5799999999999s)]
*  and GW Pharma proved is if you do find a legitimate medical use for these drugs, they can be rescheduled [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=556.18s)]
*  and they can be sold. And so between a legitimate way to make scheduled drugs medicine, between [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=562.9s)]
*  increasing academic research, you started having these biotech companies founded. Often the initial [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=569.94s)]
*  ones were in Europe or listed in Canada and they started trying to find ways to bring these [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=576.58s)]
*  potentially paradigm shifting medicines to market. How were some of these early companies and how [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=583.0600000000001s)]
*  were some of these early entrepreneurs funded? They often weren't even founded by biotech founders, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=589.7s)]
*  so you ended up with this company in investor phenotype that's maybe very alien to us here. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=595.94s)]
*  You had these companies that they were developing psychedelics but maybe they were arguing that it [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  had to be administered with concomitant psychotherapy. I remember a banker calling me and he was almost [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=607.46s)]
*  laughing when he called me and he said, you know this very strange European company, they're telling [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=613.46s)]
*  me that they're talking to you about this illegal compound and I just couldn't imagine that you [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=618.74s)]
*  would ever take this thing seriously. And you said yeah. Right and I said yeah no I'm actually [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=625.06s)]
*  taking a serious look because the therapeutic effects were real. It's hard to deny when you see [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=629.54s)]
*  the early particularly double blind data that these aren't transformative for the practice of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=634.9s)]
*  psychiatry in the future. How has this affected the regulatory space? Initially one of the roadblocks [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=639.8599999999999s)]
*  to investment was can we even reschedule these drugs once they have legitimate data and can they [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=645.38s)]
*  be sold and distributed in the U.S.? The second question particularly for psychedelics became [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=651.78s)]
*  because of their cultural baggage, their profound mind-altering effects, how is someone going to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=656.66s)]
*  get one of these drugs across the line? The FDA is really leaning in and they've even produced [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=662.9s)]
*  guidance documents for these biotechs to really help them design a development program that the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=668.1s)]
*  FDA is going to be able to approve and get across the line. The FDA actually took the same view that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=674.9s)]
*  we had which is the FDA is there to regulate drugs and not there to regulate therapists. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=680.02s)]
*  What impact has if any has the IRA's pill penalty had on psychedelics? Even before the IRA in the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  U.S. we had this preferential treatment of biologics. So if you get any biologic approved in [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=693.62s)]
*  the U.S. you get what's called biologic exclusivity and that lasts for 12 years. In the world of small [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=699.3s)]
*  molecules you only really get seven and a half years of a much weaker form of exclusivity. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=705.86s)]
*  In psychiatry we're stuck with small molecules. That's the only way we can get into the brain [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=712.1s)]
*  but there are all sorts of laws that are drafted that favor modalities that can't help us and in [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=717.78s)]
*  the same way the IRA has what's called the pill penalty, an idea that small molecules are given [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=724.58s)]
*  a shorter period before negotiation compared to biologics and this basically is telling [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=730.66s)]
*  farmers and biotechs that the government will reward you more for developing an advanced modality [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=736.5s)]
*  which is fine but what that also says in a way is we're going to protect you less if you develop [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=742.9s)]
*  drugs for brain diseases where biologics can't really go as easy. In intellectual property law [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=748.66s)]
*  you can patent a molecule you invent but you can't patent one you find in nature. So oftentimes [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=754.26s)]
*  a way to get around that is to patent the method of use of the molecules. You know if we were [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=760.34s)]
*  developing a naturally found psychedelic that we found today we might patent the method of using [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=765.62s)]
*  that molecule in treatment resistant depression but what made it even harder for psychedelics is [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=771.22s)]
*  a lot of these effects they have in psychiatric disease were already described in literature so [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=777.3000000000001s)]
*  you couldn't file a patent. This made actually this first generation of psychedelic companies [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=782.9s)]
*  have an even harder time raising money from institutional biotech investors because it was [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=787.78s)]
*  much harder for any investor to gain confidence that they'd be able to defend their innovation [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=793.3s)]
*  and if you're bringing a psychedelic to market not only are you bringing a drug that comes with [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=799.14s)]
*  cultural baggage and that will change patients lives you're also bringing something to market [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=804.9s)]
*  that's going to change psychiatrists lives they're going to have to transform their whole practices [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=809.38s)]
*  to be able to work around this molecule that requires in some cases a psychotherapist that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=815.22s)]
*  requires you to logistically schedule the psychotherapist to come in with the doctor [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=820.74s)]
*  with the patient at the same time. If you have to change the face of psychiatry you better have a [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=826.9s)]
*  long exclusivity because it could take a very long time for that drug to really make its return on [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=831.94s)]
*  investment. Well if there are other indications that psychedelics can treat then maybe that can [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  extend some of this longevity. What other areas and what other studies are taking place? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=842.58s)]
*  So in psychiatry there's this great tradition of broadening drug labels. There are anti-psychotics [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=848.1s)]
*  like Abilify that are approved not only to treat schizophrenia but also bipolar disorder and Tourette [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=853.38s)]
*  disorder and they can be used as adjunct treatments for depression so you start looking at psychedelics. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=859.94s)]
*  There's promising data in addiction so alcohol use disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=866.66s)]
*  PTSD and anorexia nervosa. You could end up with a class of drugs that really changes the face of [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=873.06s)]
*  many diseases not just treatment resistant depression. So for all the investors who are [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=879.78s)]
*  listening walk me through the valuation of psychedelics. It had a big run-up that coincided [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  with you know the COVID biotech trade that really attracted a lot of money into the sector [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=890.8199999999999s)]
*  and then the bubble burst for psychedelics in October of 2021. Psychedelics had a particularly [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=896.1s)]
*  bad year in 2021. You had Compass which before Dada was a multi-billion dollar company and after [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=902.1s)]
*  Dada it just slowly slid over the ensuing years. Compass is founded on a very simple idea that you [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=908.82s)]
*  can take the active moiety in a magic mushroom psilocybin and use it to treat depression and they [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=915.46s)]
*  ended up picking up enough excitement that they ran a very large phase 2b study. Compass presented [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=921.94s)]
*  their phase 2b data and you saw the stock drop down very precipitously on that day. When we looked at [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=928.1s)]
*  the data we saw a drug which had a 6.6 point madras delta. It's much better than spravato but to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=935.3000000000001s)]
*  generalists this way missed their expectations and similarly in psychiatry all the time you see [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=942.74s)]
*  increased rates of suicidality in clinical trials. In fact almost all antidepressants right now [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=950.0999999999999s)]
*  have a label for increased suicidality, a big black box warning at the top, and for comp 360 in [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=957.62s)]
*  that trial they saw increased suicidality that was actually dose dependent. Almost all psychiatric [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=965.06s)]
*  drugs already cause some degree of suicidality. When we look at all historical natural history [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=971.2199999999999s)]
*  data of use of psilocybin there is no other mention of suicidal ideation. As far as we're [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=977.3s)]
*  concerned comp 360 their version of psilocybin can still profoundly transform patients lives and [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  probably outdose spravato. What's happening in the private space? You know we can talk about a company [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=990.0999999999999s)]
*  developing MDMA for PTSD. Right yeah. Might be a good Silicon Valley backed company called [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=996.42s)]
*  Lycos that you can maybe walk through. When the bubble burst people saw this as a valuation [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1002.66s)]
*  reset and people started to get involved in the space again. Around the same time a company called [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1007.9399999999999s)]
*  Lycos was basically a spin out of an older charity called MAPS and they were taking all of MAPS's [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1012.9s)]
*  research for MDMA used to treat PTSD and trying to put it in this commercial vehicle to get the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1019.54s)]
*  drug approved. Last year people were getting pretty excited about the potential for the first [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1026.82s)]
*  psychedelic adjacent compound to get approved. Eventually due to deficiencies in the package [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1031.54s)]
*  certain experiments they didn't conduct certain clinical trial practice that maybe went awry. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1037.3s)]
*  They were ultimately rejected by the FDA. These psychedelic biotechs have really viable products [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1043.06s)]
*  that can really change patients lives but negative news flow just led to people fleeing the space. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1048.42s)]
*  Is that one of the major negative catalysts that we saw last year for the broader psychedelic space? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1054.6599999999999s)]
*  As soon as that event happened you saw almost every psychedelic biotech down day after day [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1061.8600000000001s)]
*  after day and that just increased cost of capital and it makes harder for these companies to get [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1066.9s)]
*  across the line. Well all is not so glum because maybe this is a good segue into a company that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1072.0200000000002s)]
*  we have long backed GH Research. Maybe tell us a little bit about that. It's an $850 million [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1081.0600000000002s)]
*  market cap company. It's up 100% year-to-date on the positive news on their phase 2b [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1089.54s)]
*  results that just came out. GH Research is a company we actually invested in. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1097.62s)]
*  Right as the psychedelic bubble came to an end they were a private company when we found them [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1101.86s)]
*  at the time. I stumbled across one of their patent filings which was a method of using their compound [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1106.8999999999999s)]
*  5-methoxy DMT in treatment resistant depression. We ended up supporting their crossover round. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1112.02s)]
*  What really makes GH Research different is they were probably the leader in seeing that it's going [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1117.86s)]
*  to be real hard for psychiatrists and even harder for the FDA to get comfortable with having [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1123.2199999999998s)]
*  psychotherapy administered concomitantly with a drug. So they took this compound 5-methoxy DMT [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1130.58s)]
*  that can get to brain really quick. You inhale this drug out of a bag that a little machine fills [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1137.6999999999998s)]
*  and you have your psychedelic trip and then you come back down and hopefully you can go on with [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1144.1799999999998s)]
*  your day. How long is that experience? Between 10 and 15 minutes long. So when you compare that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1149.86s)]
*  to psilocybin which is a six to eight hour trip or LSD which is closer to 10 hours that is a much [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1155.3799999999999s)]
*  fastest throughput. And when they came out with their phase 2b data it was you know at least to [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1162.02s)]
*  my memory the biggest drug effect I think I've ever seen in psychiatry in my life. It was I think a [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1168.1s)]
*  15.5 point difference versus placebo on the Madras scale which is a scale we use to measure [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1173.78s)]
*  depression. Over 50% of patients were in remission which is basically unheard of today in psychiatry. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1179.7s)]
*  They were in remission after how many treatments? Just one? Right after the first dose at seven [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1187.22s)]
*  days. Psychedelics which hold the promise of once a month dosing or longer you can also help the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1192.58s)]
*  psychiatrist because then they have more room to treat more patients. GH we thought was an [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1198.02s)]
*  innovation on many fronts. They had a method of use patent. They had the opportunity to have really [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1203.06s)]
*  short duration of treatment. They had the opportunity to help out the psychiatrist's office. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1207.7s)]
*  And on top of all of that this was founded by real biotech guys that have developed drugs before. So [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1213.94s)]
*  we knew they'd really go out of their way to tick all of the boxes that maybe some of the initial [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1219.3s)]
*  companies didn't. So of the patients that have gone into remission what are some of the long-term [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1224.74s)]
*  studies showing? The question of are psychedelics more durable than spravato? That's pretty settled. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1230.74s)]
*  Almost every study that's measured it has shown a response of at least a month. In almost any [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1237.54s)]
*  scenario it's an improvement over standard of care. Coming up soon you're going to be sitting [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1243.3s)]
*  with Dr. Valcheva the CEO of GH research who's very kindly visiting us from company headquarters [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1247.7s)]
*  in Ireland. Maybe tell us a little bit about that. GH has really had their work cut out for them for [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1253.94s)]
*  the last couple years. You know unlike most drug companies where they're just developing their drug [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1258.9s)]
*  which is often in pill form these guys are developing a drug device combo. One of the funniest [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1263.94s)]
*  experience I've ever had in this office is I was going through their original patent. They describe [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1269.38s)]
*  their inhalation device called the Volcano Medic. It's actually this device that people use to inhale [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1274.26s)]
*  cannabis and I was seated at my desk and I asked one of the analysts you know have you ever heard [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1279.8600000000001s)]
*  of this and he told me yeah no Connor you can go down to the store on the corner right now right [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1284.98s)]
*  here and see a version of it. I almost actually went out to buy one and deconstructed it on my [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1290.9s)]
*  desk in the office to figure out how to make it. That was one of the more interesting ways I've [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1296.82s)]
*  done diligence in my life. I'm gonna have to ask you this have you tried have you tried any of the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  psychedelics? I've met so many people that have done them particularly people that have started [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1308.82s)]
*  these companies and you know they're so evangelical about these compounds and maybe for good reason [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1312.98s)]
*  because they can change people's lives. If you ask me today have I done them? No. In the future you [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1318.42s)]
*  know who knows maybe I'll go on holiday to Jamaica at some point but I think until we're done investing [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1323.7s)]
*  I'm purely data driven here. Thank you so much Connor. This has been a fascinating look into [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1328.82s)]
*  a very important and very exciting new class of drugs and hopefully will bring a great [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p_mNZboENQ&t=1336.34s)]
