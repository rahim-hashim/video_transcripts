# GOP senator defends Medicaid cuts: ‘We’re all going to die’
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=0.0s)]
*  You know the more people find out about what Trump's been calling the big beautiful bill the less they like it [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=1.72s)]
*  And it seems every time a Republican member of Congress meets with their own voters. They get more than an earful [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=6.96s)]
*  That's because all across the country both in blue states and in red states [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=13.68s)]
*  There are millions of voters fed up with Trump's attempts to subvert American democracy and the rule of law as well as his [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=17.02s)]
*  Wildly unpopular legislative agenda now the core of the what you might call big bad bill [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=23.76s)]
*  Is a scheme to gut Medicaid the actual bill plus Republicans [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=29.68s)]
*  Refusing to renew expiring tax credits could kick nearly 14 million people off their health insurance according to the nonpartisan [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=34.72s)]
*  Congressional budget office currently run by a Republican appointee that the Republicans have been slagging of course now all of that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=42.08s)]
*  Would pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy and big corporations and don't forget people inheriting estates of 20 million dollars [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Important they get one too along the way it is possible this also might trigger [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=55.76s)]
*  500 billion dollars in additional cuts to Medicare [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Okay, all of that is very very unpopular people don't like it Republicans know this and don't want to defend the bill [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=64.12s)]
*  so most of them are either hiding from their constituents or lying to them about what the bill does or both and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=69.52s)]
*  The small group of Republicans who are actually facing the people they are elected to represent like I said getting a real earful [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=74.88s)]
*  We've been tracking these town halls in the house [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=81.84s)]
*  But today it was Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa's turn. She faced her constituents at a town hall [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=84.68s)]
*  She held at 730 in the morning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  So when we are talking about the corrections in this reconciliation bill again [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  It's corrections of overpayments and people that have not been eligible for these programs [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  By law as it is currently written [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=108.28s)]
*  so when you are arguing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  When you are arguing about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=114.76s)]
*  illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=117.2s)]
*  1.4 million [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=120.84s)]
*  1.4. They're not they are not eligible so they will be coming off so [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=123.04s)]
*  We people are not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=130.4s)]
*  Well, we all are going to die [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=132.88s)]
*  so for heaven's sakes [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=135.52s)]
*  For heaven's sakes folks, okay [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=139.4s)]
*  No, but but well what you don't want to do is listen to me when I say that we are going to focus on those [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=141.92s)]
*  That are most vulnerable those that meet the eligibility [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=149.48s)]
*  requirements for Medicaid we will protect [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  We will protect them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=157.56s)]
*  Just to be clear [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=160.48s)]
*  There's like 10 million plus American citizens that are going to be kicked off Medicaid [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=162.32s)]
*  According to the CBO's own estimates again run by a Republican currently now [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=167.64s)]
*  I suppose the best thing that can be said about that response from Joni Ernst. We're all going to die [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  Is that it is I suppose a refreshingly honest articulation of what I would say is a kind of a core Republican ethos [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=177.72s)]
*  At least when it comes to policymaking for the poor and vulnerable [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=185.4s)]
*  It's an ethos. We have seen time and time again, particularly remember during the COVID pandemic [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=189.8s)]
*  You saw a fair amount of Republican members at the time saying, you know, we're all gonna die [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=193.64s)]
*  As you might expect a reception for the Senators answer has not been glowing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Immediately made headlines both locally in Iowa and across the nation [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tagged Ernst words as the Republicans new pitch for their bill [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=208.72s)]
*  While Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota quip quote. I thought my job as senator was to try to keep my constituents alive [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  Having said all that this is a thousand page bill. There's a lot more wildly destructive stuff. That's hiding in there [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=220.96s)]
*  That's flying under the radar. We're gonna cover some of it as this goes on one example is a very very small [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  But dangerous provision that is meant to aid [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=234.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's assault on the federal judiciary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  The only one of the three branches of government providing any semblance of oversight to his reckless and often illegal agenda [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=240.52s)]
*  Now the provision that the House Republicans put in the bill could allow him to skirt federal contempt orders [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=247.11999999999998s)]
*  Things that his Department of Justice has been flirting with basically day in day out [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=253.32s)]
*  This week voters tried to make Republican congressman Mike flood of Nebraska answer for that. I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=258.28s)]
*  Do not agree with that section that was added to that bill [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=266.12s)]
*  This provision was unknown to me when I voted for the bill [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=270.64s)]
*  This morning senator Ernst was also made to answer for it as [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=275.66s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware, but apparently many of the representatives were not aware at the time [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=280.66s)]
*  Nestled within the thousand pages of this bill was a small clause which [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=286.70000000000005s)]
*  For the first time in our nation's history in fact effectively prohibits the federal courts from enforcing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=290.98s)]
*  contempt orders so ma'am my question my question for you today is [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  Will you pledge to us our constituents who you serve that you will not vote for this bill or any other bill that contains? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=301.06s)]
*  This poisonous provision, okay? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=308.82000000000005s)]
*  So one thing that I will explain because we we have a lot of subject matter experts here in the room is that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=313.62s)]
*  The house has written one version of a bill the Senate is taking up our own version of the bill the two will be married together [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=321.54s)]
*  At some point there is a rule called the bird rule [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Silence so the bird rule [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=336.94s)]
*  States that anything that goes into our package in the Senate it [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=339.74s)]
*  Can't be policy it can't be policy it has to be focused on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=346.34s)]
*  Mandatory spending I don't know anything about that provision that talks about [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=352.78s)]
*  Mandatory spending or revenues now [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  I just got to say something real quick in that I think a little condescending lecture to our own constituents [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=362.1s)]
*  The bird rules enforced by the Senate parliamentarian who the Senate Republican majority just completely overrode last week [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=367.38s)]
*  To take out California's electric car vehicle regulations [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=375.42s)]
*  There's no reason to think they're gonna listen to the parliamentarian this time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=379.70000000000005s)]
*  And you may have noticed the Senators answer was about process rather than the actual substance of the provision [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=384.14000000000004s)]
*  There's been this debate. I think in our political discourse and I myself go back and forth about [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=390.1s)]
*  basically how much [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=395.66s)]
*  Democracy is some abstract principle in the US Constitution order that people are like. Yeah. Yeah, yeah [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=397.26000000000005s)]
*  or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=402.74s)]
*  Is it something that everyday real people actually care about and can rally behind and here's the thing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  I want to leave you with there are people who got up this morning at the crack of dawn in Red, Iowa [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=411.1s)]
*  State with Republican representation went for the Trump for Trump to go talk to their senator [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=419.1s)]
*  Doing everything they can as informed citizens because they do believe in this country's constitutional order and they are trying to protect it [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=425.5s)]
*  And I think there are more of them than Republicans are betting on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=432.96s)]
*  You [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZFhF-2O4-w&t=440.62s)]
