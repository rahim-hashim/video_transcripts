# ‘It’s not normal’: Retired Lt. Gen. sounds alarm on Trump troop deployment
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc)
*  In 2005, when the city of New Orleans was in a dire state of emergency from Hurricane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=0.0s)]
*  Katrina and its aftermath, thousands of National Guard members were sent there to help with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=5.3s)]
*  rescue and relief at the request of the state's governor at the time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=9.46s)]
*  And while people were really happy to get federal help, it was also obviously something [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=13.38s)]
*  new and scary to have military troops on their streets. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=17.02s)]
*  And there was this memorable scene captured in Spike Lee's documentary about Katrina, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=21.36s)]
*  where the lieutenant general in charge of the military efforts on the ground told his [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  troops to make sure to put their weapons down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=29.38s)]
*  That man, the now retired Lieutenant General Russell Honore, is going to join me in a moment. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=45.34s)]
*  But the important point here is, here is a military leader who understood the proper [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  role of America's armed forces. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=54.56s)]
*  They are not there to police civilians. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=56.82s)]
*  That's not what the U.S. military does. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=58.36s)]
*  They are there to protect and to help them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=59.96s)]
*  The difference now is that people like Lieutenant General Russell Honore have been purged from [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=63.1s)]
*  a lot of the upper ranks so that Donald Trump can try to convert the military into a partisan [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=67.84s)]
*  tool, mobilizing the National Guard and even the Marines against peaceful protesters. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=73.28s)]
*  This is all being overseen by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a loyalist, former Weekend [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=79.12s)]
*  Morning cable news host who has less qualifications for his current job than anyone with that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=83.92s)]
*  title in decades, possibly ever. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=88.6s)]
*  Retired Lieutenant General Russell Honore is a former commander of Joint Task Force Katrina, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=91.8s)]
*  which was responsible for coordinating military relief efforts after the hurricane in 2005. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=96.04s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=100.8s)]
*  Lieutenant General, it's great to have you on and you have a unique perspective to share [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=102.56s)]
*  here as someone who had that experience in New Orleans. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=105.6s)]
*  What are your concerns, worries? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=110.22s)]
*  What are you thinking about this deployment of the National Guard over the governor's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=113.62s)]
*  objections and the deployment of 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=116.9s)]
*  I think it's not normal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=122.56s)]
*  Initially, it didn't look illegal because they were going to protect federal property, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  but the protocols were not followed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=129.84s)]
*  I mean, you've got to mobilize the governor's National Guard. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=131.5s)]
*  The first person you speak to is the governor and you make sure he's got an alignment with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  that if you're going to mobilize them, entitle 10 to send them overseas, or if there was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=139.8s)]
*  a discussion with the governor and encouraged the governor for the governor to mobilize [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  the National Guard, well, it would have been a better way to do this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=148.66000000000003s)]
*  But the fact that the president jumped a gun on the governor on Saturday when he reached [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=152.10000000000002s)]
*  into California without consultation with the governor by all reports and mobilized [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=159.9s)]
*  2000 of his National Guard, then simultaneously the Pentagon put a 700 Marine, initially 500 Marines, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=166.26s)]
*  on prepared and deployed order from Portland. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=174.6s)]
*  And none of that made sense because the Marines, I know that it didn't have the equipment and they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=178.32s)]
*  were not trained to do this type of civil disturbance. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=183.76s)]
*  They are trained to do direct combat, run on beaches and run uphill and do it very well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=187.6s)]
*  But this is not a primary mission. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=193.38s)]
*  Whereas the National Guard are required, the infantry begins to have annual training on civil disturbance. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  But when he mobilized 2000, I knew damn well they didn't have 2000 kits of riot control equipment [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=201.82s)]
*  because the Guard managed that equipment and they sent it around as needed to the different states. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=207.92s)]
*  So I think the president jumped a gun and as opposed to de-escalating, I think it may have escalated [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=212.77999999999997s)]
*  the events and the California Police Department, which consists of 117,000 police in California, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=222.28s)]
*  I think has its situation under control. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that point you said about training strikes is important. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  We were showing that B-roll and if I'm not mistaken, I want to be someone in the control room correctly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=233.16s)]
*  if I'm wrong, I think that B-roll was showing some of those U.S. Marines who are now being trained in, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=236.92s)]
*  you know, civil disturbance work. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=242.56s)]
*  This reporting from NBC News says the deployment is fueling concern. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  Some of the Marines have not been properly trained for interacting with civilians, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=250.08s)]
*  including children, potentially tense law enforcement operations. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=253.12s)]
*  And to my understanding, they actually aren't deployed out there yet, which sort of raises the point of like, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=256.98s)]
*  is it all worth the 134 million dollars and a bunch of National Guardsmen who may not get paid, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  as far as we can tell, according to early reporting, is this all worth it to be using the military in this way? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=270.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, the Guard will get paid. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  And number two, the Marines, the way we do it in the Army, if you mobilize the Brigade and they need training, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  we send a detachment from the Military Police School for Linwood and they go out and they do a quick training [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=287.26s)]
*  regiment for the troops in counter-protest activities. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=295.12s)]
*  I assume that's who the Marines lean to, to come out and bring the attack team out to help them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=299.76s)]
*  But again, they're well organized, they can get the resource. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=306.0s)]
*  But the experts in America on the part of the protests is the big police departments like Los Angeles, New York. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  They're the experts on counter-protest operations. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=316.06s)]
*  So I wish them well. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  That footage was National Guard. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  I should just make a quick correction on this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask you also about the scene that we saw at Fort Bragg, I believe it was yesterday, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  in which the president appearing before a bunch of uniformed soldiers, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=332.36s)]
*  you know, we have subsequent reporting that they screened those soldiers to make sure that they agreed with the president politically. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=338.6s)]
*  They told people that didn't agree with him to make sure they were out there also for fitness level. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=344.86s)]
*  And the president gave a very partisan speech. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  You've got, you know, active duty uniformed soldiers booing the mayor of California. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  What did you think of that scene? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=357.06s)]
*  Not much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=359.86s)]
*  I was embarrassed. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=361.36s)]
*  It was an inappropriate speech. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=363.36s)]
*  And in my 37 years in uniform, I had never seen some SHIT like this happen in real life. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=366.06s)]
*  And it happened on live TV with the biggest voice in America, the most powerful man in the world, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=374.26s)]
*  standing before troops and taking advantage of their emotions and getting them fired up to be a cheerleader for them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=381.06s)]
*  And I think the army, this will be a dark day in the army. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=388.76s)]
*  The president has done two things this week. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=391.46s)]
*  He's used our military in the abusive way by standing in front of his young troops and egging them on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=394.26s)]
*  He's deployed troops over the weekend to go do one of the missions nobody in the military want to do, which is civil disservice. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=402.36s)]
*  Nobody in the uniform like to go out and put guns toward looking at our own citizens. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=409.86s)]
*  And the second thing he's done, the most unpopular thing with soldiers, he's generated this big ass parade in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=417.16s)]
*  The last mission any soldier want to do is go spend three or four days getting ready for and going to a parade where they're [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=424.26s)]
*  sleeping in warehouses and on the floors of office buildings in D.C. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=431.46s)]
*  That is not a nice move to celebrate the 250th birthday to our army. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=435.96s)]
*  No, by the way, happy birthday, Army. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=440.46s)]
*  Retired Lieutenant General Russell Honore. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=443.86s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time tonight, sir. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=446.16s)]
*  God bless America. God bless our troops. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  Thanks, sir. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdM1l9PhAcc&t=473.86s)]
