# ‘Horrific’: Planned Parenthood head reacts after Supreme Court backs bid to defund org
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA)
*  Today, the Supreme Court made it even harder for patients on Medicaid to access health [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=0.0s)]
*  care from Planned Parenthood. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=4.92s)]
*  Just to be clear, it was already illegal for Medicaid to pay Planned Parenthood or, for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=6.74s)]
*  that matter, any other provider for abortions, except in very, very limited circumstances [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=11.56s)]
*  — rape, incest, life of the mother. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=16.36s)]
*  The court's 6-3 ruling allows South Carolina to stop patients who rely on the government [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=19.0s)]
*  insurance program from using Planned Parenthood for any health services. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=24.62s)]
*  South Carolinians who relied on the clinic for things like cancer screenings, birth control, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=30.18s)]
*  or LGBTQ patient support, all totally unrelated to abortion, can no longer use their usual [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  provider. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=42.34s)]
*  The case stems from South Carolina's decision in 2018 to kick Planned Parenthood out of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=43.34s)]
*  its Medicaid program. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=48.46s)]
*  That was a decision that the state's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, made to, quote, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=50.22s)]
*  protect the sanctity of life, unquote. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=54.58s)]
*  But after this Supreme Court ruling, any other state that wants to block funding for Planned [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=57.82s)]
*  Parenthood simply because it also offers abortion services that don't use taxpayer funds will [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=62.82s)]
*  be able to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=69.62s)]
*  So now the poorest Americans could lose the right to get routine health care from the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=71.1s)]
*  provider of their choice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=74.78s)]
*  Joining me now is Alexis Miguel-Johnson. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=76.9s)]
*  She is the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=79.18s)]
*  Alexis, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=82.7s)]
*  So my first question for you is what services are at stake here? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=84.5s)]
*  What you just named, birth control, STI testing and treatment, access to wellness exams, cancer [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=91.7s)]
*  screening. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean, as you named, Medicaid was not paying for abortion services, and yet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Governor McMaster made it clear that his entire agenda was about denying access to, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=105.82s)]
*  benefits using Medicaid at Planned Parenthoods because he had an ideological agenda and because [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=114.38s)]
*  he had the power to weaponize Medicaid. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=120.02s)]
*  And the Supreme Court agreed with him, and they effectively decided that state officials [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=123.3s)]
*  can pick your health care provider for you based on what their ideological agenda is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=128.42s)]
*  And it's absolutely horrific and uncomfortable. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=133.82s)]
*  What does all of this mean for Planned Parenthood as an organization in itself? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, look, I mean, as I said, this is not a decision that is going to be limited [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  to Planned Parenthood, nor is it a decision that is going to be limited to South Carolina. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=149.58s)]
*  You know, what the Supreme Court has done is effectively denied people their dignity [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  to decide who their provider is going to be, and they've also denied the justice for patients [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=160.84s)]
*  to be able to sue to determine who their provider is going to be. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  And so we expect to see a number of states, states that also share the same ideological [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  agenda as Governor McMaster in South Carolina, try to, you know, kick Planned Parenthood [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=178.4s)]
*  out of being able to get reimbursed for the services that they provide, like any other [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=184.56s)]
*  health care provider across the states that also have a, you know, strong bias against [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=191.28s)]
*  abortion as health care. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=198.6s)]
*  And that is going to impact so many people, millions of people living in all these states. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit more about what happens to the patients themselves who might [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=206.44s)]
*  lose access to care at Planned Parenthood or other clinics that are affected by this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=212.24s)]
*  court decision. One of the largest crisis pregnancy center groups, which are these places [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=218.24s)]
*  that persuade women who are pregnant not to have abortions, they're now telling their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=224.36s)]
*  member clinics to avoid performing prenatal ultrasounds on women who they suspect have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=229.8s)]
*  ectopic pregnancies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  That's according to recordings obtained by NBC News. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  So if the local Planned Parenthood in an area is forced to shut down, what kind of quality [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=241.08s)]
*  of care will patients end up with, whether they end up at a crisis pregnancy center or [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=248.28000000000003s)]
*  whatever other options are available? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, we actually have data and history on what happens when health centers shut down, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  right? During COVID, when, you know, obviously people had limited access to getting care in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=265.24s)]
*  clinic, we saw a spike in STIs, including chlamydia, which has a direct relationship to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=272.56s)]
*  left untreated to ectopic pregnancies. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  And the impact of, you know, obviously having an ectopic pregnancy and not having that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  treated means incredible danger to the life of the person who is pregnant with that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=290.04s)]
*  potential ectopic pregnancy, both for the life of the parent as well as the embryo. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  That is something that we will see over and over again when you see the impact of these [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=306.8s)]
*  centers closing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=314.68s)]
*  And so I think it's really important for us to remember in this moment that the Supreme [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Court has made this decision to limit access now to Planned Parenthood for patients who [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  have used Medicaid as their insurance. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=327.16s)]
*  We also have Congress that is working its way through a congressional defund of Planned [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=330.08s)]
*  Parenthood that could impact a million patients, that could impact 200 health centers that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=337.92s)]
*  are at risk of closure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=344.28s)]
*  And when you again close health centers in communities, that may be the first point of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  entry for many people into the health care system. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=352.64s)]
*  It means that we are at greater risk for seeing the kinds of increases in everything from [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=356.32s)]
*  missing access to birth control, to getting the STI treatment and care that they need. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=363.56s)]
*  And for the centers that may be at risk of closure, many of them are in states that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  actually still provide abortion access. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  So we're going to see with this defund around Medicaid and this defund around Planned [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  Parenthood, really an increase in the public health crisis that we are already experiencing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQcVVDZvSA&t=383.52s)]
