# ‘Obscene and depraved’: New reporting on Palestinians killed while waiting for food
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0)
*  After months of a total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli government and increasingly dire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=0.0s)]
*  exasperated warnings of starvation from humanitarian groups and aid groups, the Trump administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=5.92s)]
*  in partnership, I think, with the Israeli government has come up with this new way of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=11.24s)]
*  delivering aid into Gaza just in the last, say, six weeks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=14.72s)]
*  So rather than Israel just lifting the blockade and letting groups like the UN and other NGOs [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=18.76s)]
*  that have delivered aid in Gaza for years, what's happened is the Trump administration [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=24.22s)]
*  backed this new private organization. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=28.44s)]
*  It calls itself the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to administer help. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=32.44s)]
*  So it's a third party group. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=37.64s)]
*  Its funding is unclear and it hires private military contractors. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=39.0s)]
*  So far, I have to say, as you're watching the scenes, it has been one of the most obscene [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  and depraved undertakings that I have ever seen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  According to many reports, report after report after report, seeking aid in Gaza, some of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=55.04s)]
*  the most desperate people on the planet right now, has become a deadly exercise both under [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=60.4s)]
*  the IDF and the GHF. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=65.3s)]
*  Here's a headline from May 28th, just days after the GFAA started getting running, opening [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=67.6s)]
*  its aid sites. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=72.56s)]
*  Quote, one killed 48 wounded when crowd was fired upon at chaotic Gaza aid site, health [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=73.56s)]
*  officials say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=79.64s)]
*  June 24th, quote, Gaza health authorities say Israel kills 44 waiting for aid. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=80.84s)]
*  Just yesterday, quote, 94 Palestinians killed in Gaza, including 45 people waiting for aid, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=86.8s)]
*  authorities say. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  That's just three of them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  I could keep reading them, but I won't. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=95.4s)]
*  In total, the UN says more than 600 Palestinians have been killed seeking aid, meaning they [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=98.0s)]
*  line up and they're trying to desperately get food and they get shot at. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of whom were killed at GHF run sites. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=108.72s)]
*  This does not seem to be an effective means of distributing aid. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=113.0s)]
*  In the past two weeks, reporters at Hararetz, the Associated Press and the BBC have all [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=116.68s)]
*  published investigative pieces on these killings, citing internal whistleblowers who say that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=122.36s)]
*  both Israeli soldiers and private American GFH contractors have been firing into crowds [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=129.0s)]
*  of hungry Palestinians with live ammunition who had posed no threat. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=135.4s)]
*  The GHF has now says it has launched an internal investigation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=141.32s)]
*  It calls a reporting about its contractors, quote, categorically false. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=145.12s)]
*  Specifically, GHF says the sound of gunfire at an aid line that can be heard in this video [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=148.76s)]
*  obtained by the AP was actually from the IDF and occurred outside the vicinity. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=155.0s)]
*  Now, the organization offered no evidence to support that conclusion, but that's what [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  they say. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli government called the reporting about the IDF soldiers firing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=164.44s)]
*  into crowds, quote, blood libels. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=168.52s)]
*  Hani Al-Madun is the director of philanthropy at the UN Relief and Works Agency USA. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=171.16s)]
*  He's also the co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, which is operated by his family members [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=176.12s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=180.32s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=181.36s)]
*  Honey, first, because you have expertise in this, I want to just start with the question [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=183.64s)]
*  of if Israel were to largely lift the blockade and allow, say, food and water and medicine [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=188.68s)]
*  things to flow in, what would be the kind of normal way? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=194.92s)]
*  Like, how would an NGO such as yours or others distribute that aid? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=199.32s)]
*  And have there been problems doing that before? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=203.88s)]
*  Great, Chris. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=208.12s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=208.68s)]
*  Obviously, I support the work of you at our W.A. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=209.64s)]
*  and its organization that's the largest humanitarian actor inside Gaza, the backbone [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=213.72s)]
*  of the humanitarian response. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  In a perfect world, there is 1,008 trucks for UNRWA waiting outside the borders. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=220.2s)]
*  The Israelis have yet to allow those. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's assume that these trucks are allowed in at 500 or 600 truck capacity. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, these go to the warehouses and UNRWA staff process them and then start texting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=233.64s)]
*  families in Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  Hey, come pick up your food parcel between four and five. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=240.76s)]
*  Come up, pick up your food parcel from this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=244.28s)]
*  And this works because UNRWA has 400 distribution sites. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=246.6s)]
*  These sinister plan with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation have only four sites. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=257.48s)]
*  UNRWA staff don't carry guns. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=258.12s)]
*  They do not harm any Palestinians. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=259.64s)]
*  In fact, since October 2023, 15 million patient visits. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=262.28s)]
*  UNRWA delivered the health care in Gaza for 15 million people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=267.08s)]
*  Zero people have been harmed in this process. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=271.24s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been in existence for about two months, and they've [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  been responsible for killing more than 600 Palestinians. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=278.68s)]
*  These are not just statistics. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=282.44s)]
*  We have family and friends in California, whose siblings have been killed at those sites. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=284.2s)]
*  This is not somewhere we're not removed from this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=288.84s)]
*  This is the case where Israeli soldiers, some of them are dual citizens, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=292.12s)]
*  and American, let's just say mercenaries, who are hired with big pay and brought into [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=296.28s)]
*  Gaza to shoot people who are being starved. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=302.2s)]
*  This is not the way to do it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  And did I mention these guys are expensive? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=306.28s)]
*  Did I mention that more than 55 percent of their budget, they're spending it in armored [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  vehicles? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=313.64s)]
*  Guess who doesn't have armored vehicles? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  UNRWA does not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  Any UN agency. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  Even outside the UN, there's many great American NGOs that work in Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  They have distanced themselves from this charade, this PR campaign that murders and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=324.44s)]
*  hurt Palestinians. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=329.24s)]
*  Every morning I open my eyes, I read 11 Palestinians, 15 Palestinians killed in Rafah at the aid [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=330.52s)]
*  sites. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=336.36s)]
*  And that's not counting the other folks that are being, according to many experts, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=337.08s)]
*  genocided in Gaza. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=340.92s)]
*  I just want to be clear here that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, to what they say, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=344.44s)]
*  is that it's not true what's been said about their private contractors, and that they're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=348.76s)]
*  there for the benefit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=357.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=358.84s)]
*  I've looked in an interview with an individual who's running it, that they're there for the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=359.08s)]
*  benefit of people there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=362.2s)]
*  Again, I want to just restate what their line on this is, what they say they're doing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=363.56s)]
*  But to the point you made before, it just seems like they're solving a problem that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=369.08s)]
*  shouldn't exist in the sense of the sort of chaos and pressure would go away if you [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=377.48s)]
*  just went back to some aid distribution like they had, say, during the ceasefire. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=384.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's not like this is not something that the groups there couldn't do if they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  were allowed to, I guess is my question. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=395.0s)]
*  They have the capacity to do it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=397.72s)]
*  Organizations like the Organization of Support learn more at UNRWAUSA.org. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  But really, Chris, the issue that they're using food as a weapon, they want to create [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  as much pain possible in Gaza because if a Palestinian receives their food aid from a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=409.24s)]
*  UN agency or any other agency, they're not going to feel disrupted to their lives as much. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=414.52s)]
*  So this is the idea, is to use it as a pressure point, a negotiation tactic. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=420.2s)]
*  You understand I'm looking at these conditions. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  And the first thing the Israelis usually offer, hey, we're going to allow aid in. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=427.56s)]
*  And this is sad because families like mine are being starved and denied food. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=432.28s)]
*  They're trying to find food. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=436.52s)]
*  You couldn't go. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  You have to travel to the South and then risk losing your life. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  And this is not sustainable. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=441.64s)]
*  This is expensive. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=443.4s)]
*  And this is immoral. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  My family, through the Gaza Soup Kitchen, serve soup every day to about soup and water [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  for about 30,000 Palestinians every morning, a family operation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  Zero Palestinians have been harmed. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=455.23999999999995s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=457.32s)]
*  Because people trust us. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=457.96s)]
*  And we deal with desperate people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=459.55999999999995s)]
*  We do not shoot at people. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=461.72s)]
*  We're among the community. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh2bgKoibj0&t=463.24s)]
