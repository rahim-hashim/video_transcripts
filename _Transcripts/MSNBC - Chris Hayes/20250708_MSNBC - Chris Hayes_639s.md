# ‘I'm about to go throw up’: MAGA turns on Trump over Epstein scandal
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump's administration is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=0.0s)]
*  facing a full rebellion from the MAGA faithful, the most die-hard, the people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=4.0s)]
*  that spend all day online talking about Donald Trump. Some of the most president's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=8.92s)]
*  most strident supporters are furious at his Department of Justice after [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=13.94s)]
*  concluded there would be no further disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein related [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=18.6s)]
*  documents and that basically everyone should just drop it move on. This comes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  after his Attorney General, Pam Bondi, basically spent months hyping some sort [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=29.56s)]
*  of big reveal from the Department of Justice. Epstein, of course, the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=34.2s)]
*  disgraced New York financier who died in federal custody back in 2019 while [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=37.92s)]
*  facing child sex trafficking charges related to what prosecutors says what a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=42.56s)]
*  years-long scheme to abuse young women. A new memo for the DOJ reiterates the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=47.08s)]
*  department's position that Epstein was not murdered, noting quote, after a thorough [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=53.1s)]
*  investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=57.24s)]
*  suicide in his cell. They even released nearly 11 hours of security camera [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=61.24s)]
*  footage from outside Epstein's cell that night of his death, although that will [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=66.44s)]
*  likely do little to quell the ongoing conspiracies, especially considering the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=71.64s)]
*  video is missing an entire minute. The DOJ attributes that to a long-standing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=76.4s)]
*  glitch with the system. Despite all the Epstein didn't kill himself memes and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=82.12s)]
*  the never ending increasingly baroque conspiracies, the MAGA faithful are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=86.76s)]
*  really mad about this part of the memo, quoting it here. This systematic review [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=91.76s)]
*  revealed no incriminating client list. There was no credible evidence found [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=96.96s)]
*  that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=101.52s)]
*  do not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=105.48s)]
*  uncharged third parties. Now that claim that there was no shadowy client list, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=109.0s)]
*  ostensibly containing evidence that Epstein was secretly blackmailing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=114.92s)]
*  political and financial and Hollywood elites certainly seemed to contradict [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=118.56s)]
*  what Trump's own attorney general said on television back in February. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=122.92s)]
*  One of the things that you alluded to, and this is something Donald Trump has [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  talked about, that DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=133.12s)]
*  Will that really happen? It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  a directive by President Trump on reviewing that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=143.56s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. She did just say that, right? We [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  just heard her correctly. Now her Department of Justice says no such list [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=152.68s)]
*  exists. But again, this wasn't just Pam Bondi misspeaking or speaking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=157.52s)]
*  ambiguously, one off for Mark. I mean, seriously, four months, this has been a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  drumbeat. She's promised some sort of big revelation from the documents. I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=168.2s)]
*  mean, do you remember this? Back in February, the White House even held this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=171.76s)]
*  big event with right wing influencers sharing a bunch of what turned out to be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=176.0s)]
*  previously reported in the public domain information. They had repackaged into a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=180.8s)]
*  bunch of fancy binders, which they handed out to people. And so when the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=185.28s)]
*  DOJ comes back basically yesterday and says, you know what, looked at it and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=190.48s)]
*  turns out nothing to see here. Well, now that same right wing media ecosystem is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=195.2s)]
*  absolutely fuming. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=200.88s)]
*  The whole thing that this tape shows he didn't kill himself is like a joke. But [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  worse than that, it's a joke that we all get like they're not fooling anybody. So [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  I feel like we're at a dangerous point now. So now by coming in and being part [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=212.27999999999997s)]
*  of the cover up, the Trump administration has [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  become part of it. I mean, it's just you cannot see it any other way. So I'm the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  I just got to the office. I'm gonna go throw up actually. And I only have every [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=227.68s)]
*  few years when something really, really bad happens or something. I mean, I'm [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=231.24s)]
*  physically gonna gonna probably right now. My mouth is watering right now [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=233.52s)]
*  because [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=239.08s)]
*  because I have integrity. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=242.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, I just really need the administration to succeed and to save [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=247.08s)]
*  this country. They're doing so much good. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  And then for them to do something like this, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=253.88s)]
*  there's my guts out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=256.36s)]
*  Do you see what you've done, Pam Bondi? You have made Alex Jones cry and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=258.92s)]
*  possibly puke, which he only does a few times a year because of how much [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=264.32s)]
*  integrity he has. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=268.0s)]
*  In hindsight, though, I don't think that those people should be very surprised. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=269.96s)]
*  As we have said before repeatedly, this has been a consistent theme of our [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=274.36s)]
*  reporting here on this program. If you were a single issue voter in 2024 and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=277.68s)]
*  hating Jeffrey Epstein and people associated him was your only issue, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=283.48s)]
*  Donald Trump should not have been the candidate for you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=288.36s)]
*  Trump and Epstein were friends. Everyone has seen the photos and the party [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  tapes at Mar-a-Lago where they seem to leer at women. And we remember when [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=296.12s)]
*  Trump famously told New York Magazine, I've known Jeff for 15 years, terrific [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=300.12s)]
*  guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said he likes beautiful women as [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  much as I do. And many of them are on the younger side. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=309.72s)]
*  One of the women at the center of the Epstein sex trafficking case, Virginia [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  Jufri, who recently died by suicide, claimed that she was actually recruited [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=318.8s)]
*  as a minor by Epstein's collaborator, Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=323.56s)]
*  And when that collaborator was facing trial for sex trafficking, Donald Trump [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=330.04s)]
*  seemed oddly concerned about her. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=333.32000000000005s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison and a lot of people want to know if she's going [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=336.32s)]
*  to turn in powerful people. And I know you've talked in the past about Prince [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=342.92s)]
*  Andrew and you've criticized Bill Clinton's behavior. I'm wondering, do you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  out? I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=354.32s)]
*  well, frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=357.96s)]
*  lived in Palm Beach and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=362.44s)]
*  whatever it is. Her friend or boyfriend, Epstein, was either killed or committed [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=367.24s)]
*  suicide in jail. She's now in jail. Uh huh. Yeah, I wish you well. I'd wish you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=372.4s)]
*  well. I'd wish a lot of people well. Good luck. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=376.68s)]
*  Do you remember that? Remember that when Maxwell was being tried for sex [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=381.08s)]
*  trafficking and Donald Trump was asked about her and his first thing seems to be [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=384.96s)]
*  like, I wish her well. Used to know her back in the day in Palm Beach, saw her [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=387.4s)]
*  all the time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=390.6s)]
*  Now think back to the 2024 campaign. Do you ever remember Donald Trump talking [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=393.24s)]
*  about Jeffrey Epstein amid all the crazy nonsense he said about all kinds of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=397.08s)]
*  insane Internet sewer gutter stuff? I mean, and then there's the JFK stuff and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=401.5s)]
*  the Hannibal Lecter rifts you would do. He conveniently never brought this case [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=407.2s)]
*  up. And then when he was asked about it, Trump gave this truly remarkable answer. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=410.56s)]
*  Americans have lost a lot of trust in institutions and I think there's been a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=418.24s)]
*  lot of discussion, especially online and especially with young people. How do we [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=421.32s)]
*  rebuild that trust in institutions? The CIA, the FBI, all all those institutions? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=424.64s)]
*  You're right. Some people think that one way to build trust is to declassify [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=430.12s)]
*  things that everyone's talking about. I know you talked earlier about I don't [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=435.36s)]
*  want to be a conspiracy theorist. So if you were president, would you declassify [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  you can answer yes or no to this. Would you declassify the 9 11 files? Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=442.56s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? Yeah, I did. I did a lot of it. Would you [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  declassify the Epstein files? Yeah, yeah, I would. All right. I guess I would. I [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  think that less so because, you know, you don't know it. You don't want to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=457.28s)]
*  affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because it's a lot of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=460.68s)]
*  phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would, or at least you think [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=463.56s)]
*  that would restore trust help restore trust. I don't know about Epstein so [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=468.68s)]
*  much as I do the other. Certainly about the way he died. It would be interesting [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=472.2s)]
*  to find out what happened there because that was a weird situation and the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=475.6s)]
*  cameras didn't happen to be working, etc, etc. Epstein, I don't know so much. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=478.68s)]
*  I mean, this became a huge obsession of the kind of online maga, right? I mean, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  really, listen to how then podcaster Dan Bongino spoke about this earlier this [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=490.76000000000005s)]
*  year before joining the Trump DOJ. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  This isn't about Epstein or 911 or JFK or RFK. It is but it isn't. It's about a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=499.68s)]
*  bigger thing. If you're lying about that, you're lying about everything. Who's on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=505.92s)]
*  the Epstein tapes, folks? Who's on those tapes? Who's in those black books? Why [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=510.6s)]
*  have they been hiding it? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=517.0s)]
*  Good question, Dan Bongino. That was back in February. And here is Dan Bongino [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=520.4s)]
*  just two months later now installed as Trump's second in command at the FBI. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw6aJ_giqms&t=525.64s)]
