# 'Insult to voters': North Carolina justice on the GOP bid to steal her seat
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM)
*  Yesterday, a Trump-appointed federal judge put an end to the audacious and lawless attempt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=0.0s)]
*  by the North Carolina Republican Party to basically straight-up steal an election they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  lost. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=11.52s)]
*  Republicans challenged more than 65,000 votes that were flawfully cast in the state Supreme [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=12.52s)]
*  Court race last November in an effort to erase the narrow loss by their candidate, Jefferson [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=18.14s)]
*  Griffin on the left, despite two recounts confirming Democrat Allison Riggs' victory. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=23.16s)]
*  Well in a 68-page ruling issued yesterday, U.S. District Judge Richard Myers ordered [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=28.72s)]
*  the state election board to certify Riggs' win, writing, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=33.56s)]
*  You establish the rules before the game. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=37.16s)]
*  You don't change them after the game is done. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=39.92s)]
*  Joining me now is North Carolina Supreme Court Associate Justice Allison Riggs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=42.72s)]
*  Justice, good to have you on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=47.92s)]
*  I guess the first question is, can I call you that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Is this settled or is this provisional? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=53.92s)]
*  As I know, the federal judge ruling has stayed for seven days. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=56.1s)]
*  It would allow your opponent to appeal this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=58.54s)]
*  What is your understanding of the status of your election and your position on that state [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=61.54s)]
*  Supreme Court? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=66.3s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Chris. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=67.3s)]
*  I am a justice. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=69.94s)]
*  I have been serving on the North Carolina Supreme Court for nearly two years now, and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=71.22s)]
*  I will continue to serve until my race is certified next week. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=76.5s)]
*  Yesterday was a decisive win for voters in North Carolina and for voters across the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=81.94s)]
*  country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  My win was confirmed and democracy was defended. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=88.38s)]
*  We do have a period of uncertainty where my opponent can appeal, but I'm very hopeful [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=94.78s)]
*  that the thoughtful, well-reasoned decision from the federal district court yesterday [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=101.1s)]
*  that vindicating voters whose right to vote was attacked and confirming that the federal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=109.34s)]
*  constitution prohibits changing the rules after an election, that that ruling will stand. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  This was, you know, sometimes races are very close. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  This was a very close race. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  I think there were five and a half million votes cast. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  Your victory margin after recounts was 734 votes, which in a statistical sense is narrow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  In a sort of absolute terms is 734. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  You win the race. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=137.54s)]
*  For people that haven't followed this, like, what were Republicans up to here? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=138.54s)]
*  And how is it taken until May to get certainty here? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=144.54s)]
*  So what I can tell you is that North Carolina elections statewide are always tight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=150.54s)]
*  This is not the smallest margin that a North Carolina Supreme Court race has been decided [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=156.54s)]
*  by. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=161.54s)]
*  What I worry, I don't know what people's motivations are. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=162.54s)]
*  What I worry is that we see this troubling trend of disappointed candidates and their [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=166.33999999999997s)]
*  supporters seeking to overturn election results that they don't like. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=171.33999999999997s)]
*  And that kind of gamesmanship is antithetical to the principles of democracy that we hold [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=176.33999999999997s)]
*  dear. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  It is an insult to voters. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=183.33999999999997s)]
*  In particular, voters who were attacked here were military voters serving from about four [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  counties, Democratic-leaning home counties, and military voters in the other counties [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=195.54s)]
*  weren't challenged. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=199.54s)]
*  So this threat to North Carolina voters that we beat back yesterday presents the threat [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=200.54s)]
*  to Pennsylvania voters tomorrow and the rest of the country another day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=207.54s)]
*  We cannot let what happened in 2020, what happened here in 2024, keep happening again [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=212.54s)]
*  and again. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=219.54s)]
*  And I will continue to fight until my fight is done and then I will continue to defend [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  and uphold the Constitution after that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this sort of ludicrously, to my mind, bad faith effort to toss, I think [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  it was tens of thousands of votes from four heavily Democratic counties from overseas [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  ballots that were lawfully cast according to the rules. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  And here's what the federal judge, again, I should say this federal judge was appointed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  by Donald Trump, if I'm not mistaken, in his first term, says about the effort to do that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  The case concerns whether the federal Constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=250.54s)]
*  after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters and in so [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=255.14s)]
*  doing treat those voters differently than other similarly situated individuals. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=260.04s)]
*  This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=263.94s)]
*  offer no process to those who may have been classifies as ineligible. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=267.94s)]
*  To this, the court, the answer to each of these questions is no. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=271.44s)]
*  How do you feel reading those words, given how far we've come here in this audacious [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=276.74s)]
*  attempt to overturn your victory? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=283.44s)]
*  To me, it's reassuring that there are judges out there willing to put country and the Constitution [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=287.44s)]
*  above party and personal political ambition. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=294.44s)]
*  We in North Carolina elect our state court judges and I think as tough as the last six [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=298.44s)]
*  months have been and they have been tough, a lesson we can take away is that North Carolina [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=304.44s)]
*  needs judges who are willing to stand up for the rights of everyone, not just the people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=310.14s)]
*  they believe supported them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=315.54s)]
*  And we cannot allow this pernicious idea to take hold that we can pick and choose which [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=318.64s)]
*  elections we want to respect. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=326.04s)]
*  I think the voters decide elections, not politicians, not courts, and I think we have an opportunity [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  now here in North Carolina and across the country, wherever judges are elected, to show [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  what it looks like, to follow and respect the rule of law first and foremost and I hope [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  to continue doing that for a very long time on the North Carolina Supreme Court. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJR44KDyYM&t=354.24s)]
