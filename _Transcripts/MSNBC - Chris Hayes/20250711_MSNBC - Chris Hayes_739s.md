# MAGA world in disarray over handling of Epstein case
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ)
*  NBC News confirming with two sources tonight. The deputy direct the FBI, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  number two at the bureau, Dan Bongino, didn't report for work today and he may [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=5.48s)]
*  be on the verge of quitting altogether after openly clashing in the White House [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=10.44s)]
*  with Attorney General Pam Bondi over her handling of the case. Now before he [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=14.82s)]
*  got his job, Bongino is making a living doing stuff like this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=19.96s)]
*  I got a big question about the Epstein files. Who's on the Epstein tapes, folks? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=24.28s)]
*  Who's on those tapes? Who's in those black books? Why have they been hiding it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Now Bongino is out there in a suit and tie with the FBI director and former [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=35.44s)]
*  fellow podcaster Cash Patel trying to unwind all that conspiracy stuff. Last [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=40.16s)]
*  week he was back on Fox promising a new video that would maybe put the story to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=46.28s)]
*  rest. There's gonna be a disclosure on this coming shortly. We are working [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=50.2s)]
*  through some, there is video. That is something the public does not... There's a video of him killing himself. No, no, not [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=56.68s)]
*  not the actual act but there the entire MCC Bay, it was only one camera. There [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  were other, there's video that when you look at the video and we will release, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=69.0s)]
*  that's what's taken a while on this, we are working on cleaning it up to make [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=73.2s)]
*  sure you have an enhanced and we're gonna give the original so you don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=76.68s)]
*  think there were any shenanigans. You're gonna see there's no one there but him. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=79.4s)]
*  Okay, keep it, remember that phrase, gonna give you the original so you don't [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  think there's any shenanigans, right? So sure enough on Monday the DOJ released [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=87.44s)]
*  nearly 11 hours of video showing the hallway outside Epstein's cell. That was [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=91.04s)]
*  supposed to prove there were quote no shenanigans. But then as journalist Julie [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  K. Brown noted on our show this week, neither the doors shown there were even [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=99.92s)]
*  Epstein's cell. On top of that the video was missing one minute of recording. Pam [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=104.48s)]
*  Bondi's attempts to explain that missing minute didn't really help convince the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=109.52s)]
*  suspicious conspiracy theorists. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=113.64s)]
*  And the minute missing from the video, we released the video showing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=116.72s)]
*  definitively the video was not conclusive. But the evidence prior to it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=122.28s)]
*  was showing he committed suicide. And what was on that there was a minute [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=130.22s)]
*  that was off the counter. And what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=134.8s)]
*  year, every night they redo that video, it's old from like 1999. So every night [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=139.16s)]
*  the video is reset and every night should have the same minute missing. So [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=145.28s)]
*  we're looking for that video to release that as well showing that a minute is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=150.2s)]
*  missing every night. And that's it on Epstein. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=153.76s)]
*  Okay, that's it. Done. Now Bondi had already stepped in, stepped in it with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=157.48s)]
*  the Epstein obsessives after promising months ago that his client list was on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=163.04s)]
*  her desk for review, then saying there was no client list this week. For [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=167.64s)]
*  explanation, the video gap didn't help. And this report from Wired magazine [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=172.2s)]
*  today isn't going to help either. An analysis of the metadata from the video [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  shows the footage was modified, likely using the professional editing tool [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=179.04s)]
*  Adobe Premiere Pro. In fact, they add the file appears to have been assembled [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  from at least two source clips, saved multiple times, exported and then [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=186.64s)]
*  uploaded to DOJ's website where it was presented as raw footage. Now Wired says [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  there's no evidence the footage was deceptively manipulated. But again, it's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=195.16s)]
*  not doing wonders for the White House's credibility with precisely the people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=199.6s)]
*  in their base who are the most skeptical of this kind of thing. And again, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=203.48s)]
*  that's at the heart of the emerging power struggle in the administration. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=208.28s)]
*  This isn't some ancillary internet thing, okay? According to the New York Times, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  it erupted into an angry face to face confrontation at the White House on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=215.64s)]
*  Wednesday when an irate Ms. Bondi accused Mr. Bongino of leaking information [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=219.44s)]
*  to the news media in the presence of FBI Director Cash Patel, the White House [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=224.88s)]
*  Chief of Staff Suzy Wiles and one of her deputies. A source close to Bongino [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=228.4s)]
*  told NBC News today, Bongino is out of control furious. This destroyed his [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=232.56s)]
*  career. He's threatening to quit and torch Pam unless she's fired. And you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=237.16s)]
*  wouldn't want to be a kettlebell on Dan Bongino's home gym on a day like today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=242.24s)]
*  It's a common sentiment in MAGA world today. Remember Trump openly courted all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=246.32s)]
*  these people, the sort of deep state conspiracy theorists, right? The voters [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=250.64s)]
*  who believe Trump's schtick that there's some system of bad guys that's rigged [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=254.6s)]
*  against them by the elites, but he's not one right. And that these elites [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  patronize child sex trafficking rings and that Epstein was at the heart of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=263.44s)]
*  And this was a critical part of the MAGA coalition. Like, I honestly think the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  kinds of folks that are sort of believe this are gave him his margin of victory. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=273.36s)]
*  And today these people are in rebellion. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=280.12s)]
*  This is the most famous pedophile in modern day history, and people are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=281.88s)]
*  absolutely not going to accept just a memo that was written that says there is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=287.28s)]
*  no client list. It's not about just a pedophile ring and all that. This is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=292.2s)]
*  about who governs us, right? For this to go away, you're gonna lose 10% of the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=296.24s)]
*  MAGA movement. If we lose 10% of the MAGA movement right now, we ain't gonna [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=303.12s)]
*  We're gonna lose 40 seats in 26. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  So we're stupid. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=310.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're the idiots guys. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=311.92s)]
*  Just let you know, we're wasting time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=314.88000000000005s)]
*  That is like in all seriousness, that is, that is, I think what is enraging people [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  right now is it's insulting our intelligence. Like obviously the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=324.44000000000005s)]
*  intelligence community is trying to cover it up. Obviously, the Trump [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=328.12s)]
*  administration is trying to cover up. Something changed because they ran on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  this idea of exposing it all. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=334.76s)]
*  Everyone in that world is mad at Bondi and Bongino and Cash Patel right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  But again, I just want to put something out there, something that we've returned [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=341.84s)]
*  to time and time again, as you see Donald Trump whispering in the ear of his [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=346.24s)]
*  buddy Jeffrey Epstein as they ogle girls, women. Maybe it's the big guy at [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  the top who has strong feelings about this. Again, you don't have to draw some [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=355.08s)]
*  crazy contorted conspiracy flowchart to try to connect Donald Trump to that guy [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  on your screen talking to him, Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=365.44s)]
*  They were friends for years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=368.88s)]
*  But right now, the president would really appreciate it if you all just dropped it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=380.12s)]
*  You're asking we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=382.48s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=387.52s)]
*  Ken Delaney is an NBC News justice and intelligence correspondent. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Brandy Zdrasny is a senior MSNBC reporter. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=394.56s)]
*  Both of them have followed the Epstein case and the MAGA reaction to the latest [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=397.24s)]
*  obfuscation from the DOJ and they joined me now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=400.64s)]
*  Ken, let me start with you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this what we saw happen after that memo is this sort of uprising rebellion [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  and all sorts of sort of precincts of the MAGA coalition and also not even the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=408.84s)]
*  MAGA coalition, just generally in social media. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=412.52s)]
*  That seems to have reached into the very heart of the Trump administration and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Justice Department. Tell us what happened today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. And Chris, I should say this is not the first time we've seen [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  this kind of thing happening. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=425.92s)]
*  There's been a lot of discontent about, for example, why isn't the Justice [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Department putting people in prison over Russiagate and things like that? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=430.56s)]
*  But this is the most passionate, the most explosive issue, this Epstein situation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=433.76s)]
*  And what happened was Bongino and Patel, by all accounts, were on the same page. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  They all worked together with Todd Blanch and Pam Bondi and senior DOJ staff to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=444.16s)]
*  craft this memo where they agreed that there was no client list. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=449.20000000000005s)]
*  He committed suicide. There was no secret conspiracy theory. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=453.0s)]
*  And then Bongino saw the reaction and he didn't like it at all. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=456.6s)]
*  And now it's pushed him to the point where, as you said, he didn't show up to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  work today. We've confirmed that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=465.56s)]
*  And he is telling people that he's contemplating resigning. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  And there's a larger mosaic here. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=471.04s)]
*  Both Bongino and Patel have been frustrated with Pam Bondi. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=474.04s)]
*  They meet with her frequently. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=478.76s)]
*  It goes beyond the Epstein issue. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=480.08s)]
*  There's just a clash of personalities there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=481.88s)]
*  And to Bondi's credit, although she did stoke the conspiracy theories and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=483.92s)]
*  you reported on this before and you mentioned it today with the client list on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=490.12s)]
*  my desk remark, her people are now saying that she meant the Epstein files were on [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=494.0s)]
*  her desk, not the client list. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=498.04s)]
*  You know, she could have spent four years trying to string along the conspiracy [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=500.12s)]
*  theorists and say that, you know, the files are going to be released any day now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=504.12s)]
*  But instead, they decided to get it out, you know, release this memo that says, by [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=506.92s)]
*  the way, this is what investigators have been telling our colleagues who covered [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=511.64000000000004s)]
*  this case for years. There is no client list. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=514.0s)]
*  There's no there there. There's no further reason to charge anybody else. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=516.36s)]
*  But, you know, for the Trump Justice Department to say that, knowing there was [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=520.0s)]
*  going to be this kind of blowback, I give them a little credit for that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=523.44s)]
*  But Dan Bongino is off the reservation and there's some indication Cash Patel [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=526.2s)]
*  may be as well, although they're both in different situations. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=530.2s)]
*  Dan Bongino, we don't know his motivation, but we do know that he made a living as [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=532.9200000000001s)]
*  a conspiracy theory podcaster and he's about to lose the audience that made him [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=538.12s)]
*  a rich man. And he's there's a moment of truth here. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=544.36s)]
*  He could leave now and regain that audience if he sticks with this idea that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=547.24s)]
*  there is no conspiracy theory behind the Epstein affair. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=552.04s)]
*  He's going to lose that audience. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=555.6s)]
*  And, you know, Cash Patel will always be the former FBI director when he leaves [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=557.2s)]
*  and former FBI directors tend to be able to make a lot of money. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=560.96s)]
*  It's less true about the deputy director. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=563.8s)]
*  And so Bongino may be considering that scenario right now. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=566.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as someone who speaks into a microphone for a living, I'll just say [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=571.24s)]
*  that, like, seems like an easier job than trying to run the Federal Bureau of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=574.36s)]
*  Investigation or be the number two there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=577.4s)]
*  Just if you're if you're choosing which which one's an easier path, Brandi, I want [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=579.64s)]
*  to, you know, to this point here about that, this is so you know, there's there's [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  both the hardcore MAGA folks are obsessed with this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=587.0s)]
*  And then there's as you move out to people that are not even follow politics that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=589.72s)]
*  well, but like, do kind of know about it, think about it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=593.24s)]
*  Here's Laura Loomer, who has her own backstory and has said just wildly offensive [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=595.76s)]
*  and despicable things many times, has engaged in all sorts of conspiracy theories. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=600.04s)]
*  But she's sort of very close to Donald Trump. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  We've got, you know, they talk to each other. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  And here's her today. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=610.48s)]
*  Cash Patel and Don Bongino should call for Blondie's public resignation today to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  save themselves to also push for full transparency in the Epstein files, giving [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  Blondie courtesy. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=620.6s)]
*  Oh, she's calling her Blondie. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  OK, giving Blondie courtesy for her side is more than she deserves. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=622.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump should just fire her. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  Why has this exploded in the way it has as someone who has followed this for a long [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=627.2s)]
*  time? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=631.96s)]
*  I have never seen this level of just [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=633.12s)]
*  incredible disarray within the MAGA movement. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, you played a little clip of it at the Turning Point USA Convention [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=641.36s)]
*  today, the summit today. People were lining up to call Steve Bannon part of the deep [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  state, someone called Donald Trump part of the deep state. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=650.6s)]
*  Now, like people are just incensed and looking for a scalp. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, the easiest one for Laura Loomer and for other people that you talk [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=657.72s)]
*  about, besides being blonde, which I take offense to, is the fact that, you know, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=661.32s)]
*  she came and she really did a humiliating thing for the MAGA folks, which is to give [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  them all binders and leave them at the White House and do this big photo op. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=670.2800000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, once they open the binders, they realize that was stuff that was [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=674.08s)]
*  all publicly available before. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=677.24s)]
*  So she she humiliated them. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=679.2s)]
*  And so that's why I think a lot of people right now are really on Dan Bongino's [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  side. Bongino has always been very much one of them. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=684.9200000000001s)]
*  But the problem is, and I've talked to a lot of MAGA folks today, and the problem is, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=688.56s)]
*  is what let's say Bondi's gone, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=693.28s)]
*  Let's say Trump fires her or she leaves. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=695.76s)]
*  Then what? What does Bongino do? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=698.36s)]
*  They're still tasked with they want a scalp. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=700.72s)]
*  MAGA wants a payday. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=703.72s)]
*  They've been promised Hillary Clinton was going to be locked up forever. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=705.6s)]
*  They've been promised Guantanamo Bay. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=708.6s)]
*  This is their line in the sand. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=710.28s)]
*  They are not budging. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgmvt1RDqPQ&t=711.84s)]
