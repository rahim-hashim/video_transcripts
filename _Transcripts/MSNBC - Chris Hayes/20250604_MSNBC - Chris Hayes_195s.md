# 'Schooled': Law professor (and Chris' wife) torches Josh Hawley in legal smackdown
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE)
*  There's a fun moment in the United States Senate yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'd love to share with you mostly because it features the amazing constitutional law professor slash podcast host slash New York Times [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=2.4s)]
*  Contributor Kate Shaw was also my wife and it also features Missouri Senator Josh Hawley who is amazing in his own way [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I guess [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=17.42s)]
*  Kate was a minority party witness in the Senate Judiciary Committee the Democrats on the committee had called her and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=18.7s)]
*  Had an exchange with Hawley who has been going to ridiculous lengths to defend the lawlessness of boss Trump and explain [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=24.02s)]
*  Why he keeps losing in courts day after day after day [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=30.34s)]
*  Hawley had printed out a big gotcha chart [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=34.54s)]
*  Which he seemed to think proved that Donald Trump is a victim of a vast network of biased judges from across the ideological spectrum [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=36.72s)]
*  Professor Shaw suggested there might be a more simple explanation [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=44.46s)]
*  What's the principle of when an injunction biting non-parties [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=49.18s)]
*  Which was never done in this country before the 1960s and let's see the chart the Trump chart [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=53.059999999999995s)]
*  Which was done really only once Trump came into office for the first time [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=58.78s)]
*  You don't think this is a little bit anomalous [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=63.66s)]
*  You don't think that's a little bit strange [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=65.66s)]
*  A very plausible explanation Senator you have to consider is that he is engaged in much more lawless activity than other presidents, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=67.66s)]
*  You must consider that as a possibility [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=73.66s)]
*  Before the 1960s and suddenly Democrat judges decide we love the nationwide injunction [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=76.66s)]
*  And then when Biden comes office now it now it's Republican appointees as well senator and the 1960s is where some scholars [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=83.34s)]
*  Begin sort of locate the beginning [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=89.34s)]
*  Mila Sahoni who's another scholar of universal injunction suggests 1913 is actually the first others in the 20s [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=92.1s)]
*  You're the Republican do it for 150 years before [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=97.72s)]
*  Well the federal government was doing a lot less until a hundred years ago [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=101.14s)]
*  So I'm you know, there's many things that have changed in the last hundred or the last 50 years [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=104.66s)]
*  So so long as it is a Democrat president office [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  Then we should have no nationwide injunctions if it's a Republican president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=112.34s)]
*  Then this is absolutely fine warranted and called for that is how can our system of law? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=116.08s)]
*  Survive on those principles professor. I think a system in which there is that blind constraints on the president is a very dangerous system [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=120.86s)]
*  It was a little hard to hear there at the end [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=129.34s)]
*  But professor Shaw said I think a system in which there are no constraints on the president is a very dangerous system [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=131.02s)]
*  So yeah [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=137.1s)]
*  Maybe the reason Donald Trump is getting blocked in the courts more than other presidents that big part of the bar chart is because he's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=137.78s)]
*  Finding himself in court more than other presidents because of what he's doing and maybe not because nearly every federal judge [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  appointed by both parties [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=150.74s)]
*  including by Trump himself suddenly became [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=152.46s)]
*  insanely anti Trump [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=155.82s)]
*  To quote the witness a very plausible explanation you have to consider is that he is engaged in much more lawless activities [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  than other presidents [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=165.9s)]
*  You [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3R3xTlkECE&t=187.82s)]
