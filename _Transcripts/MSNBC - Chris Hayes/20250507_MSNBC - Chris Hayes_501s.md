# ‘Close to McCarthyism': Hayes blasts Trump's war on political dissent
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo)
*  Today, the three judges on the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=0.0s)]
*  ruled that detained Tufts PhD student Ramesa Ozturk must be transferred from that detention [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=5.16s)]
*  center in Louisiana, where she has been held for over a month, to Vermont within a week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=11.4s)]
*  And there, a judge will hear her appeal to be released from imprisonment on bail. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=15.64s)]
*  Ozturk, a legal resident on a student visa, was snatched off the street by plainclothes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=21.04s)]
*  immigration agents earlier this year. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=27.16s)]
*  You're seeing it happen now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=29.12s)]
*  She's currently being imprisoned for her protected free speech, seemingly after she wrote an [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  op-ed in her school paper last year at Tufts, where she studies, that was critical of Israel's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=36.6s)]
*  war on Gaza and Tufts' response to student protests. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=41.6s)]
*  This is part of an authoritarian attempt to criminalize thought, criminalize political [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=46.92s)]
*  speech and protest in this country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=51.82s)]
*  The Trump administration is attempting to use the full force of the government to punish [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=54.32s)]
*  those who disagree with its support for Israel's war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=58.12s)]
*  We have seen the state weaponized in new ways against legal immigrants like Ozturk and Mahmoud [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=62.6s)]
*  Khalil and others. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=68.16s)]
*  But the federal government is also cracking down on U.S. citizens, putting enormous pressure [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=70.4s)]
*  on universities, both public and private, where some of the most organized and active [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=75.08s)]
*  protests surrounding Gaza have formed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=78.64s)]
*  As we speak, you see there, dozens of students at Columbia University are occupying the school's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=81.32s)]
*  main library, for example. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  There are NYPD officers on the scene, Mayor Eric Adams, who has aligned himself closely [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  with President Trump, called the protest unacceptable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Protests of all kinds are happening all over the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=96.84s)]
*  I mean, cities and universities have been collaborating with the Trump administration's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  pressure campaign to stop them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  NYU, for example, tried to bar more than 30 pro-Palestinian students from taking their [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=105.76s)]
*  final exams if they did not renounce their rights to protest first. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  They later walked that back amid public pressure. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=115.04s)]
*  In Texas, a federal lawsuit was filed last week accusing UT Austin of collaborating with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=118.64s)]
*  the Texas government to, quote, suppress pro-Palestinian speech in violation of the First Amendment. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=123.2s)]
*  Part of that suit now includes body cam audio of a police officer questioning the legality [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=128.76s)]
*  of arresting peaceful protesters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=134.44s)]
*  At Barnard University, again here in New York, student journalist found her graduation under [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=137.28s)]
*  threat for simply covering a protest at her school, not participating in it, covering [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=141.52s)]
*  the protest. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  Barnard, too, may have backed down due to pressure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=147.84s)]
*  This atmosphere, this use of pressure and legal means to kind of render taboo an ideological [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=152.36s)]
*  tendency, it's the closest I've seen to McCarthyism in my lifetime. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=160.96s)]
*  It's an attempt to take a specific, constitutionally protected ideological perspective and intimidate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  people away from expressing it through threats of force and banishment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=170.2s)]
*  It's gotten to the point where when I saw these viral images of musician Dave Matthews [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  holding up signs reading, stop the genocide and stop killing children, honestly, my first [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=179.28s)]
*  thought was to check his immigration status for fear the Trump administration would try [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  to have him deported. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=189.32s)]
*  Turns out, though born in South Africa, he's a naturalized U.S. citizen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=191.04s)]
*  And here's to me what's so crazy about all this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=196.32s)]
*  It's crucial as this happens not to lose sight of what all these people are protesting in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=202.7s)]
*  the first place. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=207.88s)]
*  Gaza has been bombed for a year and a half. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=210.08s)]
*  Best estimates we have are that 15,000 children have been killed, a million people have been [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=213.76s)]
*  dislocated, the entire strip has been effectively razed to the ground, all of which happened [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=219.12s)]
*  with the sometimes tacit, often explicit support of the Biden administration, as new [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=224.16s)]
*  reporting from Israel's Channel 13 and drop site highlights. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=228.76s)]
*  And after all that, the Trump administration says that the real extremism, the danger, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=233.44s)]
*  is the one happening on college campuses. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=237.88s)]
*  And now just this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is announcing moving on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=241.6s)]
*  to the newest phase of his plan, which at least as reported and as communicated by ministers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=246.16s)]
*  in his own government appears to be to bring about an ethnic cleansing in Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=251.24s)]
*  Both the United Nations and the Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, has said that ethnic [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=258.64s)]
*  cleansing there is already underway. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=262.92s)]
*  Netanyahu is openly promising to destroy everything in Gaza, although almost everything is destroyed, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=265.44s)]
*  to make life there so miserable that two million Palestinians will be forced to flee. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=271.32s)]
*  The hopes for the return of remaining Israeli hostages being held by Hamas almost certainly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=276.08s)]
*  extinguished. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=280.96s)]
*  Here is Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, just yesterday. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=283.08s)]
*  Smotrich is not the only member of Netanyahu's government openly saying stuff like this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=310.96s)]
*  The Times of Israel quotes National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir saying, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=340.88s)]
*  Gaza must endure hell, and hell also means bombing all the aid depots that Hamas holds, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  as well as halting the supply of electricity and water. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=349.44s)]
*  Doing so will cause mass starvation of Hamas terrorists and their supporters in the Gaza [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=352.52s)]
*  Strip and will allow us to return to war with tremendous force when Hamas terrorists are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=356.44s)]
*  weak and exhausted without any significant ability to fight back and we can crush them [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=361.04s)]
*  without difficulty. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=365.48s)]
*  Just today, Chef Jose Andres' World Central Kitchen wrote an alarming dispatch, quote, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=367.84s)]
*  After serving more than 130 million total meals and 26 million loaves of bread over [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  the past 18 months, World Central Kitchen no longer has the supplies to cook meals or [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=378.28s)]
*  bake bread in Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=383.32s)]
*  Food and aid have not entered Gaza in more than two months. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, instead of opposing any of that, our government is enabling it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  The Trump administration, in fact, is apparently involved in negotiating conversations about [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=394.52s)]
*  what countries will take the Palestinians' force to flee from the desperation, engaging [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=399.08s)]
*  in the facilitation of what would essentially amount to mass population transfers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=405.28s)]
*  And that's a phrase that rightly recalls some of the worst episodes in human history. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  So currently, we are looking at US and Israeli policy that is more aggressively radical and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=416.32s)]
*  more flagrantly in violation of international law and human rights than I think we've seen [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=421.6s)]
*  before. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=426.4s)]
*  But if you point that out or you hold up a sign or you protest or you write a student [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=428.36s)]
*  op-ed on campus, the Trump administration may try to label you a terrorist and enemy of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=432.84s)]
*  the state and have you removed from the country or put into detention for months. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=438.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, too many top figures in the Democratic Party have effectively abdicated their leadership [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=442.28s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=447.64s)]
*  So what exactly are young Americans who, as almost every poll shows, have increasingly [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=449.2s)]
*  sour in Israeli policy in Gaza, what are they supposed to do exactly? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Should students shut up and pretend that their government isn't abetting mass civilian death [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  and population transfer? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=463.48s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=466.24s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=467.24s)]
*  No amount of repression and bullying is going to successfully stamp out the movement against [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=468.32s)]
*  this ongoing carnage. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  If history is any indication, it is just as likely to make the movement stronger. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvfafPaKjXo&t=475.72s)]
