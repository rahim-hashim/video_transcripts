# ‘It’s not a game’: RFK Jr. grilled over health department cuts
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw)
*  Secretary Kennedy, whose decision is it to withhold thousands of grants and billions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=0.0s)]
*  in funding for life-saving medical research at NIH that we approved on a bipartisan basis [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=8.64s)]
*  in this subcommittee? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=14.26s)]
*  We are not abandoning any life-saving research. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=15.32s)]
*  Is funding for Alzheimer's Disease Research Center's DEI? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=20.16s)]
*  You're holding up $65 million for 14 of those centers in nine states, including the University [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=24.32s)]
*  of Wisconsin-Madison. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=30.96s)]
*  Is funding for cancer centers, DEI? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=32.56s)]
*  What have you done about it? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  What have you done about the epidemic of chronic disease? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=37.4s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you are shivering. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=40.64s)]
*  What have you done about the epidemic of chronic disease? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=41.64s)]
*  Seriously, Madam Secretary, I would ask it to hold back and let the senator ask the questions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=44.92s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I'm asking you a question about child care. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=50.36s)]
*  I'm asking you who made the decision to withhold child care and development block grant funding. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=54.28s)]
*  That was made by my department. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=59.68s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=61.64s)]
*  Jr., the man who's been arguably the most destructive member of Donald Trump's cabinet and its competitive, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=62.64s)]
*  was before the Senate again today where he was grilled about cutting billions of dollars [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  in life-saving medical research. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=72.62s)]
*  You are cutting programs and firing staff with no plan and no understanding of what [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=75.92s)]
*  the department you are leading even does for the American people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=80.52s)]
*  Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, is ranking member of the appropriation subcommittee [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  that held today's hearing and she joins us now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=90.36s)]
*  Good to have you, Senator. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=93.04s)]
*  It's great to join you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=94.88s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=95.88s)]
*  You know, your line of questioning today focused on something that has been really eating at [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=96.88s)]
*  me and kind of driving me nuts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=101.04s)]
*  So I would love for you to explain this as an appropriator. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=102.72s)]
*  My understanding of all of this funding is that it was appropriated by the Senate and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=106.0s)]
*  the House and fairly granularly, like this is something that folks like yourself are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=112.12s)]
*  pretty invested in and there's actually pretty specific line items for what this research [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  is and who it goes to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  It seems that billions of dollars of it have been unilaterally canceled. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Is that, to start out, is it even lawful? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=133.56s)]
*  Like can they do what they have done? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=136.64s)]
*  So let's start with the lawfulness. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=140.54s)]
*  The Constitution provides that Congress makes laws and passes appropriation bills that carry [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=142.32s)]
*  the weight of law and that the administration, including the Secretary of Health and Human [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=148.38s)]
*  Services, should administer those funds, should implement our laws. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=153.64s)]
*  And we are finding out, and it's not easy to uncover this because they are not being [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=158.88s)]
*  transparent, but we are finding out that they have refused to fund over 3,000 research projects, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=164.2s)]
*  that they are quite short of what we included in our appropriations measures in terms of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  funding biomedical research through NIH. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=182.52s)]
*  And then we're also finding out, which is equally as disturbing, is that they have fired [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=186.08s)]
*  top experts and scientists across Health and Human Services and we have no report on that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=191.56s)]
*  So yes, when they fail to spend money that Congress has appropriated, that is called [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  impoundment and it is illegal and we need to press in court about those issues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=204.68s)]
*  But I also really fear that RFK Jr. is doing, in some cases, possibly irreparable harm to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=213.12s)]
*  agencies within Health and Human Services, that even if we are able to appropriate on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=222.4s)]
*  a bipartisan basis moving forward, it will be hard to repair the damage that has been [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=229.04s)]
*  done this year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=236.12s)]
*  One of the themes here, and that's on the question of sort of lawfulness constitutionally, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=237.94s)]
*  but then there are also just the tangible effects of this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=242.16s)]
*  I mean, the U.S. is the biggest, spends more on biomedical research than any other country [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=243.96s)]
*  in the world, it is the center for that, people come from all over the world for that reason, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=248.8s)]
*  it is one of the things the U.S. does arguably better than any country on earth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=253.36s)]
*  I want to play for you what your colleague Senator Durbin asked about and then get your [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=258.6s)]
*  reaction because it doesn't seem to me very maddeningly like the Secretary actually is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=262.44s)]
*  explaining what's going on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  So here's Secretary Durbin, Senator Durbin, I'd love to get your response. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  Take a list. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  How can we possibly address his concerns and give hope to people across the country who [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  are suffering from so many diseases when our government is cutting back on that research? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=279.76s)]
*  As I said, Senator, I do not know about any cuts to ALS research and I'm happy to be with [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=285.76s)]
*  you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=292.76s)]
*  I just read them to you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=293.76s)]
*  So this just keeps coming up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=294.76s)]
*  You say you're cutting research, he says, I didn't know about that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  He sort of like dodges as opposed to saying, yes, we are and here's why. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=298.8s)]
*  Is that what is going on? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=301.68s)]
*  I guess my. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=304.88s)]
*  Look, biomedical research is being cut severely and it has real consequences for my constituents, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=305.88s)]
*  for people across the United States. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=313.2s)]
*  We read the headline last week about a nine and a half month old being saved by gene editing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=315.64s)]
*  therapy that was developed by the NIH. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=323.36s)]
*  Most children with the same condition would die within weeks or months of birth. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=327.56s)]
*  We know that immunotherapies and other therapies that have been recently developed are saving [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=332.68s)]
*  tens of thousands of lives. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=338.88s)]
*  And if we lose our cutting edge, we will also lose our brightest and best minds to other [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=341.84s)]
*  countries, to other careers. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=347.4s)]
*  And so this is a very damaging set of actions that are being taken right now. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=350.08s)]
*  And lives are in the balance. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DgEK3UlJEw&t=356.52s)]
