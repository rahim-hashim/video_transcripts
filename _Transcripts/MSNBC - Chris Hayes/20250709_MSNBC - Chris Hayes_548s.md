# Chris Hayes: It's not 'partisan politics' to question Texas flood response
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, but there are times when a tragedy needs to be politicized. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=2.4s)]
*  Things can go wrong anytime. Disaster can strike anywhere. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=6.4s)]
*  The whole point of politics and government is to create the conditions to try and shield people from the very worst. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=9.8s)]
*  Take care of impacting communities afterward as quickly and efficiently as possible. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=16.3s)]
*  We can do a good job or a bad job dealing with severe weather. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  We can plan for it or not. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  We can deny it or not. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=28.299999999999997s)]
*  We can put resources towards those plans or take resources away from them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=29.9s)]
*  In the end, those are all political decisions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=34.9s)]
*  So when a tragedy does strike, we have to ask hard questions about the decisions leading up to and during that moment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=39.6s)]
*  The devastating flash flooding in Central Texas last week is a clear-cut example of that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=46.5s)]
*  This was a horrible, horrible disaster. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=52.2s)]
*  The deadliest flooding the state has seen in a century. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  At least 119 people have died across six counties since the flooding started Friday morning. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=58.2s)]
*  At least 173 people are still missing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=63.7s)]
*  Haunting images have emerged of the devastation at Camp Mystic, a summer camp for girls in the banks of the Guadalupe River. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=68.0s)]
*  At least 27 children and counselors died after they were swept up in the rapidly rising water. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=75.9s)]
*  Today at a press conference, local first responders painted a horrifying scene of what it was like trying to rescue residents as the flooding intensified. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=82.9s)]
*  Door to door, waking people up, convincing them that yes, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=93.5s)]
*  the flood waters are coming and you need to leave now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=99.5s)]
*  They rescued people out of vehicles. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=102.7s)]
*  They rescued people out of homes that were already flooding, pulling them out of windows. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  They entered water. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=109.8s)]
*  There's a trailer park that flooded in minutes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=115.2s)]
*  One officer was there by himself and he realized, I need help. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  He sounded his siren driving up and down those streets that were beginning to flood, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=125.12s)]
*  calling on his PA system for folks to wake up and evacuate. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=130.24s)]
*  And then two other officers joined him through first thigh deep, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  then waist deep, then chest deep water as they went from RVs and trailers and rescued people, carrying them safety through the water. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=141.78s)]
*  Civil servants and police officers and volunteers put their bodies in the line trying to get as many people as possible out of harm's way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=153.38s)]
*  They did incredible, incredible work. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  They did all they could. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=162.58s)]
*  But could failures by their state and federal government have been what made that rush rescue operation a necessity? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=164.68s)]
*  Were lives unnecessarily lost because of incompetence or policy decisions or dysfunction? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=171.08s)]
*  It is not partisan politics to ask those simple questions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration and its allies disagree. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything more that can be done congressionally, legislatively to help these folks? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=186.38000000000002s)]
*  In a moment like this, we feel just as helpless as everyone else. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=190.38s)]
*  All we know to do at this moment is pray. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you, these left wing liberals that want to make this political and blame this storm on Donald Trump for crying out loud, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=194.78s)]
*  this was an act of God, likely never seen before. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=200.98s)]
*  Every football team makes mistakes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=204.68s)]
*  The losing teams are the ones that try to point out who's to blame. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=207.78s)]
*  Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  I think that's what's been the most frustrating part about the politicization of this tragedy here is that there's a lot of people commenting and chirping in on what should have happened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=218.58s)]
*  No one is blaming Donald Trump for the floods. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=230.68s)]
*  That's an absurd attempt at deflection. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=233.28s)]
*  But they're trying to do this thing they have done with the epidemic of gun violence here in America, which is a shout. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=236.08s)]
*  How dare you politicize this tragedy? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=241.28s)]
*  And in some ways, floods do happen everywhere. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=244.08s)]
*  This is different than guns, but also policy is about risk and managing it and accountability, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=246.08s)]
*  The government is there first and foremost to protect us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=254.38000000000002s)]
*  And Trump knows that all the people on Fox News because they've all made a cottage industry out of blaming Joe Biden, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=257.88s)]
*  the Democrats for every natural disaster from wildfires in Hawaii and California to the flooding in North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=263.38s)]
*  Remember that one? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=272.48s)]
*  But more and more reporting is calling into question whether lies could have been saved from this flood. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=274.68s)]
*  We know, for example, that federal forecasters, the National Weather Service issued warnings to officials in the hardest hit county, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=280.58s)]
*  that's Cary County, three hours and twenty one minutes before the first reports of flooding there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=287.48s)]
*  But according to some excellent reporting in the Texas Tribune, if any local officials got those warnings and if so, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=294.08s)]
*  whether they activated in any meaningful way in that three hours and twenty one minutes remains a black box. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=300.08s)]
*  By the time the city of Carreville told residents on its Facebook page to evacuate after 7 a.m. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Friday, many residents escape routes were already flooded out. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=312.08s)]
*  According to reporting by The New York Times, the National Weather Service employee whose job it was to make sure those warnings got traction, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=316.78s)]
*  Paul Yura, the long serving meteorologist in charge of warning coordination, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=326.18s)]
*  had recently taken an unplanned early retirement amid cuts pushed by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=331.88s)]
*  He was not replaced. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=339.58s)]
*  In other words, the National Weather Service had a forecast. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=341.98s)]
*  They had a guy who used to do warning coordination with local officials. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  He was pushed out around Doge and then the warning doesn't look like it got to local officials. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=348.58000000000004s)]
*  So it sure looks like the key guy wasn't there because of Trump and Elon Musk's attacks on the government and federal workers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=355.98s)]
*  The AP reporting the Trump administration has cut hundreds of jobs at the National Weather Service with staffing down by at least 20 percent [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  and nearly half of its 122 field offices nationally and at least a half dozen no longer staff 24 hours a day. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  That was a policy change. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  That was something the government chose to do. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=381.48s)]
*  And it wasn't chosen by our elected representatives in Congress as the law requires, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=384.38s)]
*  but by an absentee and addled president and the billionaire he deputized to take a chainsaw to the government before they had a big falling out. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=389.38s)]
*  And it didn't happen in a vacuum. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=398.88s)]
*  Since May, we have had an acting director for the Federal Emergency Management Agency who, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=401.28s)]
*  quote, has no background in disaster response and told employees last month he did not realize the country had a hurricane season. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=405.88s)]
*  According to New York Times, which adds, it was not clear if he was joking. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=413.28s)]
*  According to multiple outlets now, as of this morning, the acting FEMA director has still not made any plans to visit Texas, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=418.78s)]
*  much less made any public statements on the floods that have killed over 100 people and left 179 more missing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=425.88s)]
*  This is all part of an ongoing systematic policy to attack core infrastructure of our government, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=432.68s)]
*  particularly as it relates to emergencies and weather. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=438.98s)]
*  This has shaped Donald Trump's entire political identity and the people he elevates to positions of power, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=442.68s)]
*  like an anti-vaxxer who's the head of the Health and Human Services or the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=446.88s)]
*  who's rapidly dismantling environmental protections. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=451.88s)]
*  And it's not an accident. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=457.28s)]
*  We have seen this before. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=458.68s)]
*  The first time he was president, we watched Trump use a sharpie to overrule his NOAA forecasters and literally redraw the predicted course of a hurricane. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=460.08s)]
*  In fact, the acting NOAA administrator back then, who put out a statement supporting Trump and rebuking his own climate scientists, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=470.18s)]
*  that guy, Neil Jacobs, is, you'll never guess. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=476.88s)]
*  Trump's pick to be NOAA administrator in this administration. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=480.88s)]
*  In fact, he had a Senate confirmation hearing today where he swore eventually he'd never do anything like that again. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=483.48s)]
*  You would do nothing differently? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=491.28s)]
*  I mean, there's probably some things I would do differently. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=495.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of things that I did after that to, you know, I guess, change any potential future outcome. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=498.78s)]
*  One of them was revamping. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=504.88s)]
*  Let me ask this question because I just had people, constituents die in New Mexico. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=505.88s)]
*  We had constituents die in Texas. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=509.48s)]
*  Would you sign off on an inaccurate statement due to political pressure in the same event? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=512.98s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=517.58s)]
*  No. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=519.38s)]
*  I appreciate that very much. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09o9_pB3C4&t=520.28s)]
