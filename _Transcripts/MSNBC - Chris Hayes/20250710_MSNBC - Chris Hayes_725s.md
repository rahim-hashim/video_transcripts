# ‘Ludicrous’: New report on Kristi Noem’s 3-day delay of Texas flood rescue
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Seven days after that tragic flooding in Texas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=0.0s)]
*  at least 121 people have been confirmed dead while 166 are still missing. Almost a week out [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=5.44s)]
*  from the initial flooding, search and rescue operations have now shifted to a recovery phase [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=12.56s)]
*  as hope of finding survivors dwindles. And with that horrible reality front of mind, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=17.2s)]
*  we're starting to learn the ways in which the Trump administration failed in its response to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  that deadly flooding. According to an eye-opening new report, Secretary of Homeland Security Christy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=26.88s)]
*  Noem, the person ultimately in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=32.24s)]
*  delayed the federal response to that deadly flooding for more than three days, even as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=37.84s)]
*  local search and rescue teams raced to find survivors. As you probably have noticed, Christy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  Noem has been the center of a number of stories we've reported on, like the nearly 300 people the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=48.96s)]
*  administration renditioned to a notorious prison in El Salvador, or the National Guard and Marines [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=53.68s)]
*  dispatched to the streets of LA and their show of force there, or the militarized ICE raids scooping [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=59.76s)]
*  up your neighbors across the country, or ICE agents arresting a U.S. Senator and New York City [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=64.64s)]
*  Comptroller. And throughout all those very serious stories, she has weirdly acted much more like a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=69.36s)]
*  social media influencer than a cabinet official. She has spent the bulk of her time dressing up, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=75.44s)]
*  staging political stunts for social media, like the time she dressed like a firefighter during [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=81.92s)]
*  a training drill in Alaska, or the time she wore a life preserver for a photo shoot with the Coast [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=87.44s)]
*  Guard, or when she put on an ICE vest and grabbed a gun to record a video for social media, or this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=93.36s)]
*  infamous image of her posing in front of detainees at that mega prison wearing a $50,000 watch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=100.64s)]
*  Kristi Noem is one of the most powerful people in the U.S. government. She has a profoundly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  important job and responsibility, and her tenure has been enormously destructive through the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=111.6s)]
*  intentional dismantling of so much about the fabric of this country, but particularly our emergency [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=117.2s)]
*  disaster response infrastructure, which is, of course, critical to disasters like the flooding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=123.36s)]
*  in central Texas. Now, back in June, there's a somewhat little notice item. We learned about a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=128.24s)]
*  new policy from the secretary, which, get this, required for direct approval of any DHS contract [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=134.96s)]
*  worth more than $100,000. At the time, lots of folks pointed out how absolutely ludicrous that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  policy was. One outlet, a federal news network, called it, quote, absolutely nuts in a headline. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  The Daily Coast warned that Noem's DHS disaster could wreck FEMA. I mean, we're talking about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=154.4s)]
*  an agency that routinely spends billions of dollars on disaster relief. $100,000 is pennies [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=160.16s)]
*  in comparison to what FEMA needs to be able to spend quickly. It was obvious to anyone that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=165.68s)]
*  knows anything about disaster relief that requiring the secretary's personal approval would create [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=172.16s)]
*  an enormous bottleneck and delay in a situation where time is of the essence. That is exactly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=178.48s)]
*  what happened. According to a new report citing multiple FEMA sources, Secretary Noem did not [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=184.88s)]
*  sign off on deploying the agency's urban search and rescue team to Texas until this Monday, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  more than three days after the flood struck. Now, you might be wondering what Secretary Noem was [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=199.92s)]
*  doing over that holiday week, and it turns out on Sunday, one day before finally signing off on the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=205.28s)]
*  FEMA funding as search and rescue efforts were frantically ongoing on the ground there and the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=210.32s)]
*  clock was ticking to find survivors, Noem did take the time to go to Instagram to generate some [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  audience engagement. Quote, which one do you like for the official governor's portrait to hang in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=220.64s)]
*  the South Dakota state capitol? Thank you, David Yule. Which portrait of herself should be displayed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=227.04s)]
*  in her old capitol? This portrait of Noem on horseback or this portrait of Noem on horseback [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  or perhaps this portrait of Noem on horseback. When pressed about this reporting on Fox News, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=239.68s)]
*  Secretary Noem didn't exactly deny it. CNN is basically got a report accusing you of slowing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=245.92s)]
*  the process. Would you like to respond to that? Well, there you go. Fake news. CNN again is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=253.28s)]
*  absolutely trash what they are doing by saying that because our Coast Guard, our Border Patrol, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=257.68s)]
*  BORTC teams were there immediately. Every single thing I was on, they asked for, we were there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=262.96s)]
*  Well, that's not a denial, right? Because it was the search and rescue teams at issue, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=270.56s)]
*  and it wasn't that they were denied authorization. It's that it came three days late. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=273.68s)]
*  And Noem probably doesn't need to worry about her job. I wouldn't worry about my own conscience, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=280.32s)]
*  actually, but she doesn't seem to worry about her job. Her boss thinks she's doing a, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=284.24s)]
*  how would we call it, a heck of a job to coin a phrase. In fact, her boss just spoke to NBC [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  News' Kristen Welker about it. We don't have a recording, but here's a transcript of what he [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=293.36s)]
*  said when Welker asked, there are these reports that have come out that Secretary Noem, I guess, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=296.72s)]
*  had to have signed off on FEMA expenditures and they may have delayed some of the response. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=300.8s)]
*  Trump responds, quote, I don't know anything about it. We were right on time. We were there. In fact, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=304.56s)]
*  she was the first one I saw on television. She was there right from the beginning and when she [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=309.92s)]
*  would not have needed anything, she had the right to do it, but she was literally the first person [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=315.52s)]
*  I saw on television that morning when we all woke up and saw this tragedy that took place during the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=320.08s)]
*  evening and she was right on the ball. She's done a great job. She was on TV. So obviously she's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=324.96s)]
*  doing a great job, right? So good of a job. In fact, this week she canceled, listen to this, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=330.88s)]
*  she canceled a $3 million grant that was dedicated to attempting to create a kind of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  state-of-the-art system that would be able to warn local communities quickly when extreme [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=342.64s)]
*  weather arise, including in sort of granular detail about which specific areas might be subject to the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=349.12s)]
*  highest risk. That is even though just a couple of days ago, she conceded that our infrastructure [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=355.36s)]
*  is in need of an upgrade in order to give folks adequate warning ahead of natural disasters. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  We know that everybody wants more warning time and that's why we're working to upgrade the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=368.88s)]
*  technologies that have been neglected by far too long to make sure that families have as much [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  advanced notice as possible. Well, they didn't have as much advanced as possible and the grant [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=377.76s)]
*  that was studying how to do it, you just canceled. The thing is, Secretary Noem fundamentally believes [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=384.72s)]
*  that the federal government and by extension herself doesn't manage federal disasters. So [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  not our problem. We as a federal government don't manage these disasters. The state does. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=398.16s)]
*  We come in and support them and that's exactly what we did here in this situation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=405.68s)]
*  New Jersey Senator Andy Kim is a ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=412.88s)]
*  Management. This week he sent a letter to Secretary Noem demanding the release of her plan for the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=417.36s)]
*  current hurricane season and he joins me now. Senator, I want to start with you on that last [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  clip from the secretary which is in line with something that the president has articulated. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=427.28s)]
*  It is a fundamental redirection here. They want to essentially get rid of FEMA and just take the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=432.4s)]
*  federal government out of disaster response. What do you think of that idea? Well, you see right now [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=439.52s)]
*  what happens when we have incompetence in terms of leadership at the federal level. No state is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=445.84s)]
*  going to be able to account for every single possible disaster that's out there and have [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  the resources available in that kind of way to deploy quickly. We need experts. We need people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=456.32s)]
*  that understand how to be able to respond, be able to anticipate and be able to have the data [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=462.32s)]
*  to be able to engage. And right now you see somebody who's more interested in doing what [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=467.36s)]
*  I call performative governance rather than actually leading, actually taking the steps. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=471.76s)]
*  So I really think that look, there are definitely reforms that need to be made to FEMA. We [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=476.96s)]
*  experienced some challenges when we came to Superstorm Sandy years ago in New Jersey, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=481.84s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that we just wipe it all out and completely get rid of it. That would be a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  disaster for our country and we're seeing some of that problem unfolding right now. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=490.96s)]
*  I've got to say, I've covered a lot of natural disasters through the years, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  Superstorm Sandy being one and hurricanes and droughts and things like that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=501.2s)]
*  It is a little weird that the acting administrator from FEMA has no experience in emergency [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=505.36s)]
*  management, doesn't seem to know that there's a hurricane season. Maybe he was joking, maybe not, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=511.2s)]
*  and has said bupkis while they're gutting the agency in the aftermath of this and as we prepare [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=515.68s)]
*  for hurricane season. Yeah. And also where is he right now? Has anyone actually seen him [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=521.76s)]
*  since this disaster in Texas? I mean, we have a completely absent FEMA acting administrator [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=529.84s)]
*  and he was not joking that he didn't know when hurricane season was. And actually when I was [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=536.88s)]
*  doing a nomination hearing of another senior leader of DHS, I asked them when is hurricane [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=542.64s)]
*  season. They didn't know what timetable was. And look, as we're getting into it, I mean, NOAA, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=548.0s)]
*  our own national weather service is saying that we could expect upwards of 19 named tropical storms, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=553.6s)]
*  including upwards of five category three, four and five hurricanes. This is something that's not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=559.52s)]
*  theoretical in terms of the worry that my state, New Jersey, and up and down the coast is facing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=565.2s)]
*  And when we see this kind of incompetence within the response to what's happening in Texas and the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=570.4000000000001s)]
*  horrible tragedy there, it leaves a lot of people in my state and around this country, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=575.52s)]
*  very nervous about what's to come. You know, this policy that announced, which I think anyone, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=580.08s)]
*  you don't even have to be in government, have to understand the bottleneck you're going to create [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  if the one person at the top has to approve grants at this very small level. When you're talking [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  about the budget, the agency, I want to read from the letter you wrote about your concerns about [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=594.64s)]
*  this policy as it relates to hurricane season. You say there were reports of FEMA's incomplete [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=598.96s)]
*  hurricane season plan on the cusp of the start of the hurricane season and the slowness of providing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  the plan the committee are unsettling. Any such plan must detail how FEMA's life-saving missions [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=607.36s)]
*  will not be hindered by your recent director requiring all departmental obligations over [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=611.6s)]
*  100,000 be reviewed and approved by your prior obligation, especially since the memorandum [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0IT4UksSUo&t=616.0s)]
