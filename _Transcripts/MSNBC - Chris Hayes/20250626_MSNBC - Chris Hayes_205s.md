# Why you definitely SHOULD NOT share this JD Vance meme
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak)
*  About two weeks ago, a Norwegian tourist named Mads Mikkelsen, who is not to be confused with a Danish actor from the James Bond and Marvel movies, landed in Newark Airport. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=0.0s)]
*  On arrival, he was detained by immigration agents who demanded access to his cell phone and then denied him entry to the U.S. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=10.0s)]
*  As one Norwegian news outlet, which spoke to him, reports, quote, Mikkelsen says that after being warned he could face a fine or even prison, he gave immigration officers the pin code to his phone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=19.0s)]
*  He was then confronted with its contents, pictures the officers found questionable, in particular, a meme of U.S. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=31.0s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance portrayed as bald and a private photo of a pipe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=40.0s)]
*  Specifically, Mikkelsen says the immigration officials objected to this viral meme of the vice president depicting him as a bald baby. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=46.0s)]
*  This and hundreds like it are all over the Internet, as some of our viewers may have seen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=56.0s)]
*  Now U.S. Customs and Border Protection has responded to these allegations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=61.0s)]
*  Yesterday Mikkelsen was not denied entry to the United States because of this meme you can see on your screen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=66.0s)]
*  CBP says that it was over, quote, his admitted drug use. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=72.0s)]
*  Mikkelsen says that he told the agency smoked marijuana exactly twice in his life, once in Germany, once in New Mexico. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=76.0s)]
*  But not everyone seems to believe that explanation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=83.0s)]
*  And if anything, suspected censorship of the Vance meme may have brought even more attention to it, which can happen in cases like this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=86.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon shared the viral meme of Vice President JD Vance on social media. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=95.0s)]
*  And in fact, that meme, the one you're looking at right here, even made its way to the floor of Irish Parliament. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=104.0s)]
*  We're watching a major incursion on freedom of expression, unthinkable in a Western democracy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=111.0s)]
*  This week, a young Norwegian tourist detained by ICE at Newark Airport and sent back to Oslo. Why? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=117.0s)]
*  He had this meme on his phone, Minister, a meme depicting Vice President JD Vance as a baby. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, extraordinary, extraordinary that a young person with this amusing meme on their phone depicting a public person, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=130.0s)]
*  that this would be used as an excuse to detain him for five hours and then deport him back to Oslo. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=137.0s)]
*  Again, DHS and CBP deny. That's the reason. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=143.0s)]
*  But you know, just in case they are not telling us the full story here, please, dear viewers, I hope you take appropriate precautions. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=148.0s)]
*  I strongly recommend that you do not try to cross the border with this meme on your phone or this meme or this meme or this one. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=156.0s)]
*  There is absolutely nothing funny about having any of these on your phone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=168.0s)]
*  We are just looking out for your own safety here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=174.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEz_oVNhak&t=204.0s)]
