# ‘Brilliant campaign’: Bernie Sanders reacts to Zohran Mamdani’s primary win
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY)
*  Senator Bernie Sanders is an independent of Vermont. He endorsed Zoram Mamdani for mayor in a new op-ed for The Guardian. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=0.0s)]
*  He asked, quote, Will the Democrats learn from Zoram Mamdani's victory? And he joins me now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=7.0s)]
*  Senator, what's your reaction to the big, big upset last night? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=12.0s)]
*  Enthusiastic. It was one of the great political victories in modern history. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=16.0s)]
*  Zoram ran a brilliant campaign. And I think the most significant part of his campaign, and I, Chris, would not compare it to Obama or to Clinton. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=23.0s)]
*  What Zoram understood is that in order to win, you got to be more than charismatic. And he is. You got to be more than smart, which he is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=35.0s)]
*  You got to build a strong grassroots movement around a progressive agenda. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=44.0s)]
*  He had thousands and thousands of people knocking on doors because they were excited about his message. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=51.0s)]
*  And his message said, you know what? In a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, yeah, we are going to ask the richest people in New York City to stop paying their fair share of taxes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=59.0s)]
*  So among other things we can address the major crisis facing New York and America, by the way, is soaring housing costs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=71.0s)]
*  You got to freeze rent at a time when families can't afford decent quality food. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=80.0s)]
*  He's talking about helping to create publicly funded grocery stores so that people, kids can get food that's affordable, making buses free. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=86.0s)]
*  He's giving people a positive agenda, not just going after Trump, but giving something that people can believe in, an analysis which reflects their reality. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=95.0s)]
*  So I thought it was a great campaign, and I look forward to continue to work with him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, one thing I think is that I'm curious what you think of this theory. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=111.0s)]
*  I think one thing that happens in campaigns is people get risk averse the more sort of backing they have. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=117.0s)]
*  And so they don't want to screw it up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=124.0s)]
*  And the more that you're coming from a position of like, no one expects you to win, it does also give you latitude to actually go out and try stuff. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=127.0s)]
*  Like, even whether that's a new idea is like, we're going to try publicly funded grocery stores. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm like, no one else is saying that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=140.0s)]
*  But you, I do think there's an appetite for risk or trying new things that was so palpable in this campaign that seems to me also really important. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=142.0s)]
*  But it's not just, you know, he sat up a night, I think, you know, oh, this is a risky idea, but we'll do it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=152.0s)]
*  No, right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=160.0s)]
*  I think he was prepared. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=161.0s)]
*  And this is the point. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=163.0s)]
*  Look, what is the Democratic Party today, Chris? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=164.0s)]
*  I don't think people can argue with us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=167.0s)]
*  It is funded by very wealthy people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=169.0s)]
*  It is run by inside the way inside the Beltway consultants who really have very little clue about what's going on in the real world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=172.0s)]
*  And that is why I think sadly Kamala Harris lost an election that she should have won. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=180.0s)]
*  It is a party which is not going to take on powerful special interests because of fundraising fears. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=186.0s)]
*  And it certainly has turned its back on working people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=194.0s)]
*  And Zeron did all of that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=197.0s)]
*  He changed all of that about. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=199.0s)]
*  And the question is, you know, will the Democratic leadership learn from his campaign? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=201.0s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=207.0s)]
*  I think they would rather go down with the Titanic than give up the fact that they are captains of the boat. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=208.0s)]
*  But it doesn't really matter what they think. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=216.0s)]
*  What Zeron's campaign showed is that people are prepared to stand up and fight for change. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=218.0s)]
*  We're seeing that in the fighting oligarchy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=224.0s)]
*  We saw it last week. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=226.0s)]
*  Millions of people came out to the No King rally. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=228.0s)]
*  People understand that our political and economic system is broken, that the rich get richer, and millions of people are struggling to put food on the table. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=231.0s)]
*  They understand the two parties today are not responding to their needs. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=241.0s)]
*  They want something different. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=245.0s)]
*  And I think Zeron touched on that reality. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=246.0s)]
*  I think some people may know this part of your bio, but some may not, which is that you were a congressman for Vermont, the outlaw. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=249.0s)]
*  There's one district. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=256.0s)]
*  You are obviously a U.S. senator. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=257.0s)]
*  Before that, you were a mayor in Burlington. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=259.0s)]
*  And I'm curious, you were a socialist mayor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=261.0s)]
*  There's not a ton of them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=263.0s)]
*  We don't have a really long list of socialist mayors in America. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=264.0s)]
*  So from one former socialist mayor to a man who may be a socialist mayor, you know, one of the things I think about that job, whatever size municipality you're governing is, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=266.0s)]
*  you really got to deliver for people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=275.0s)]
*  Like, it's not, you're not taking votes, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=277.0s)]
*  So people are going to see very tangibly, like, is this working or not? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=279.0s)]
*  And I'm curious how you think about what advice you would offer from that perspective, which is very different than being a senator or legislator. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=283.0s)]
*  Well, I just spoke to Zeron a little while ago, and I had some thoughts about it's going to be a very hard job. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=289.0s)]
*  I mean, running any big city in America today with all of the crises that municipalities are facing is just not easy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=297.0s)]
*  And he's going to have to think long and hard about how you can run that city in a way that really works well for working people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=308.0s)]
*  But what I did as mayor of Burlington and I was reelected three times, taking on Democrats and Republicans, is we focused on the basic issues. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=317.0s)]
*  I kept property taxes as low as I could. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=328.0s)]
*  I was conscious of the fact a lot of people can't afford higher taxes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=332.0s)]
*  We paved the streets, the sidewalks. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=335.0s)]
*  We paid attention to working class and low income areas that had been ignored for years. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=338.0s)]
*  We started an after school program. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=343.0s)]
*  We started a child care program. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=346.0s)]
*  We started a teen center for kids, which people still remember. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=348.0s)]
*  We build affordable housing, started new ideas, community land trust for housing, which is now being done literally all over the world. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=352.0s)]
*  It was started in Burlington. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=360.0s)]
*  So your point is we also spoke out on national issues and we had a foreign policy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=361.0s)]
*  People joke, Burlington had a foreign policy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=366.0s)]
*  We could do it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=368.0s)]
*  We could do it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=369.0s)]
*  But you can't do that unless you are paying attention to the day to day needs of working class people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=370.0s)]
*  So I remember one guy wrote, somebody said, your mayor was a socialist. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=375.0s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=378.0s)]
*  The guy says, I really don't know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=379.0s)]
*  But he is getting the streets paved. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=381.0s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=382.0s)]
*  It all starts from there at every level of politics. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=384.0s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=387.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHjMOQ_luvY&t=399.0s)]
