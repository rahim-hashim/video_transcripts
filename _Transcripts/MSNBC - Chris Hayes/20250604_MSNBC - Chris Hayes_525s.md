# 'Cancel culture': Hegseth to strip Harvey Milk’s name from Navy vessel
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs)
*  Harvey Milk, arguably the best known as the first openly gay politician in the state of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=0.0s)]
*  California, civil rights hero. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=5.4s)]
*  But prior to that, he spent nearly four years in the Navy Reserve. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=7.16s)]
*  He enlisted in 1951. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=10.56s)]
*  That was during the Korean War. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=12.48s)]
*  Milk was deemed quote, outstanding, very good officer material by his superiors. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=14.32s)]
*  A year later in 1952, he's made a Navy Reserve officer. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=18.44s)]
*  During the war, Milk saw action, spending two years as an operations officer on rescue [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=22.72s)]
*  submarines. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  He was a diver. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  But in 1954, Milk was outed as gay. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  When questioned by Navy officials, he admitted that he engaged in quote, homosexual activities [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=32.8s)]
*  while enlisted and was presented with two options, resign with an other than honorable [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  discharge, forgoing his military benefits that he had earned or be court-martialed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=42.28s)]
*  Milk chose to resign. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=48.12s)]
*  He spent the following decade working various jobs in New York City before he became a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=49.72s)]
*  demonstrator against the Vietnam War. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=53.36s)]
*  In the early 1970s, Milk moved to San Francisco. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=55.44s)]
*  He became involved in local politics. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  He was elected to the city board of supervisors in 1977 before his tragic assassination by [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=60.76s)]
*  a fellow board of supervisors member the following year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  In 2012, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors wrote to the Navy asking they name a ship [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=71.72s)]
*  in honor of Harvey Milk. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  And four years later, the Navy agreed to make it happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=78.4s)]
*  In 2021, a US Navy fleet oiler was named after Milk in tribute to his honorable service and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=81.24s)]
*  his status as an LGBTQ icon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=87.12s)]
*  The Secretary of the Navy needed to be here today, not just to amend the wrongs of the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=91.32s)]
*  past, but to give inspiration to all our LGBTQ community leaders who serve in the Navy in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=96.2s)]
*  uniform today and in the civilian workforce as well, too, and to tell them that we're [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=104.0s)]
*  committed to them in the future. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=108.64s)]
*  Our new Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is now going in a different direction. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=111.08s)]
*  This week, at the start of Pride Month, he took the very rare step. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=115.28s)]
*  This doesn't happen hardly ever. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=118.76s)]
*  I've covered of ordering the Navy to rename the US Naval ship Harvey Milk, quote, to align [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=120.6s)]
*  with President Donald Trump and the Secretary of Defense's objectives to reestablish the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=128.32s)]
*  warrior culture. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=132.8s)]
*  John Lovett, former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, now the host of the Love It [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=134.8s)]
*  or Leave It podcast and co-host of Pod Save America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=138.32s)]
*  And he joins me now, John. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=140.96s)]
*  I got to say, at some level, this is a kind of form of performative trolling by the Secretary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=143.52s)]
*  of Defense. But I'm like genuinely outraged by it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=148.44s)]
*  I think it's like profoundly messed up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=153.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, here's the good news. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=158.12s)]
*  You can remove Harvey Milk's name from that vessel, but that ship will still be bow to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=160.08s)]
*  stern filled with semen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=166.28s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=169.0s)]
*  No, to make it. You're welcome. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  To make a serious point about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=172.8s)]
*  Remember when we talked about the the the renaming of military facilities and bases [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=175.24s)]
*  that were named after Confederates and why that why naming our our institutions after [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=182.12s)]
*  people that rebelled against this country and were traitors to it might be a problem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=188.8s)]
*  That was a kind of cancel culture. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=193.4s)]
*  That was wrong. That was erasing our history. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=195.88s)]
*  But now you want to remove. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=198.72s)]
*  By the way, not just Harvey Milk's name, there's also they're also considering removing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=199.92s)]
*  Medgar Evers name, Harriet Tubman's name, both people who served in the military. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Harriet Tubman, a spy and a scout during the Civil War. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=210.64s)]
*  Medgar Evers served in the army during World War Two. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  It's you know, they love cancel culture. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  They're huge fans of cancel culture. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=222.84s)]
*  They just want to cancel the people they don't like. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=224.28s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that thing, too, about the warrior culture was such a reveal about how [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=226.16s)]
*  they conceive of it, like, you know, milk they have ordered. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=231.12s)]
*  These are the other ones reporting indicates per CBS that they're considering. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Harriet Tubman, it's like, say whatever you want about Harriet Tubman. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=237.92s)]
*  She was a warrior as much as of a warrior is just about any human in American history [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=242.84s)]
*  was Harriet Tubman. Like it just it gives it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=249.2s)]
*  It's such a tell about what they mean by that word that they're so obsessed with using [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=252.48s)]
*  as their kind of rhetorical cover. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=258.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we all like the the Combahee River Raid, just to name one moment in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=260.8s)]
*  American history, just an awe inspiring act of like bravery, running a military [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=267.24s)]
*  operation. Of course, we should have ships named after Harriet Tubman. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=272.68s)]
*  Like, of course, Harriet Tubman should be on our money. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=276.56s)]
*  That is heroism. But of course, you know, it look. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=279.08s)]
*  This is in some sense not a big deal, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=283.32s)]
*  The names on the side of a ship are not a big deal. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=285.48s)]
*  But when someone is honored and they are gay or they're black or they're Hispanic, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=289.0s)]
*  they comb through the record. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=295.88s)]
*  They start to suspect that maybe something else is afoot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=297.8s)]
*  Maybe they really didn't deserve it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=300.32s)]
*  But that's also, by the way, what they do if a plane crashes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=302.48s)]
*  Their first thought is, oh, I wonder if a black person was at the at the radar. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. I wonder if a woman was at the controls because then it's D.E.I. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=311.12s)]
*  Right. Then it's not the best person. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  And so it is this assumption that if someone is honored, it doesn't look exactly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=317.92s)]
*  like what they expect from a 1950s movie. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=323.04s)]
*  It's suspect. It's worth questioning. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=326.44s)]
*  You are about to do an event that caught my eye because I think it's really [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=328.92s)]
*  important to sort of raise awareness for one of the individuals who has been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=333.36s)]
*  consigned to, you know, indefinite detention in a foreign gulag, Andre Romero. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=338.44s)]
*  He is one of the folks in that CICOT facility in El Salvador. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=345.44s)]
*  He himself is Venezuelan. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=350.0s)]
*  He's an out gay man who works as a hairdresser, makeup artist, I believe, in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=352.08s)]
*  Venezuela. Tell me a little bit about this event, because we've got some news today [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=355.96s)]
*  about a judge ruling about cases like Andre's. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=359.8s)]
*  Yes. So we are doing a fundraiser for Andre. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=364.32s)]
*  It is a it is the bulwark, which is former Republicans from the right and crooked [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  coming together from the left to raise a bunch of money at a pretty big gay pride [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  show. It's a serious cause, but it's going to be a fun show because we can't just [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=379.36s)]
*  move on from this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=385.84s)]
*  He's still down there. The media moves on. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=387.2s)]
*  The story moves on to the next horror, the next outrage, a boat renaming a military [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=389.84s)]
*  parade. Meanwhile, this is a person who has been disappeared by the U.S. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=394.48s)]
*  government to a foreign hellhole. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=400.64s)]
*  Kristi Noem is asked just to provide proof of life to his mother as a mother. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=402.52s)]
*  Won't do it. It is despicable. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=407.4s)]
*  It's monstrous. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=411.32s)]
*  And we have to do everything we can to keep the focus on this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=412.76s)]
*  It is great that there was a ruling today that their rights were violated, Andre's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=416.36s)]
*  and everyone else who has disappeared without so much as hearing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=420.56s)]
*  But we can't. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=424.36s)]
*  The second we just move on is the second this becomes something that we expect, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=425.88s)]
*  except so we're doing this event will be outside the Supreme Court at five o'clock [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=429.88s)]
*  in D.C. on Friday. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=434.92s)]
*  The live show and fundraiser will be the Lincoln Center Center at at Lincoln Theater [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=437.08s)]
*  on Friday night. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=443.84s)]
*  We're it's World Pride. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=445.52s)]
*  And by the way, you want to talk about warriors. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=447.32s)]
*  Do you understand how much stamina it takes these gay guys to get through 48 hours of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=450.96s)]
*  World Pride? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=455.92s)]
*  Shed a tear for our strongest, our strongest warriors. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=459.84s)]
*  I should say that that that judge that Judge Boasberg, Judge Boasberg decision today, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=463.96s)]
*  that's a federal district judge basically certifying a class starting to certify a [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=470.68s)]
*  class saying that Andre Romero, along with 200 plus other individuals put there, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  had their habeas rights violated. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=480.8s)]
*  The government has to give them an opportunity for redress. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn7KL-jG-Hs&t=482.32000000000005s)]
