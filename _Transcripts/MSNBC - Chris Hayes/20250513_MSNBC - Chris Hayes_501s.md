# RFK Jr. swims with grandchildren in contaminated creek
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A)
*  I saw these pictures over the weekend of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on a Mother's Day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=0.0s)]
*  hike with the family. And he was taking a dip with his grandchildren in Rock Creek Park in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=5.44s)]
*  Washington, D.C. Now, I used to live right near that park. And when I saw this, my first thought [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=10.32s)]
*  was, oh, that's amazing. They finally cleaned up Rock Creek. Because I remember walking through [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=14.96s)]
*  that area, park on hot days, and wishing I could dip into the water. But it was notoriously polluted [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=20.96s)]
*  and unsafe with high levels of E. coli. In fact, raw sewage spills directly into the creek. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=27.2s)]
*  Alas, they have not cleaned up the water in Rock Creek Park. It is still so contaminated, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=34.4s)]
*  the government bans swimming in the creek, as it has since 1971. Combined sewage overflow, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=40.16s)]
*  never words you want to see. That's what's on the sign. But this country's top health official [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=46.4s)]
*  doesn't appear to really believe that germs make you sick. So he took his grandkids swimming in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  that stuff. Dr. Peter Hotez, professor of pediatrics and the dean of the National School [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=56.16s)]
*  of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. He's also co-director of the Center for Vaccine [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=60.8s)]
*  Development at Texas Children's Hospital, author of The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=65.28s)]
*  A Scientist's Warning. And he joins me now. In the grand scheme of things, this is not the most [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  pernicious or destructive thing that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has done. But it does [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  seem to me to utterly epitomize the approach, which is like if there's some group of public health [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=80.56s)]
*  experts who have taken water samples, gotten together and made some determination, this is not [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=87.12s)]
*  safe, the default is that they're wrong. Yeah, I mean, I don't understand why he made that decision [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=92.72s)]
*  to go into Rock Creek Park. I also used to live in Washington, D.C., and you knew not to go there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=99.44s)]
*  But, you know, the point, Chris, is this is with us follows a steady stream of public health [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=104.48s)]
*  disinformation that he's been pushing, whether it's about measles vaccines, whether it's about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  autism, whether it's about safe safety of our vaccine supply. You know, first it was comparing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=116.08s)]
*  that during we're in the middle of this terrible measles epidemic here and here where I am in Texas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=126.64s)]
*  And in the middle of it all, he starts saying, well, you can get the MMR vaccine or you can get [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=132.32s)]
*  this useless cocktail of nutritional supplements, vitamin A and Bucinide. And then, you know, he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  says the hospitalizations were due to quarantine. And then, you know, it goes on. Then he says the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=143.6s)]
*  MMR vaccine is a leaky vaccine. Who knows what that means? And he actually quoted this false number. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=149.76s)]
*  He says the immunity to the MMR vaccine declines 4% per year. Where does he get that from? It [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=155.28s)]
*  barely declines at all. There's one study to suggest it may decline 0.04% per year. So it's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=162.4s)]
*  a hundredfold less. Or, you know, saying that childhood vaccines are not tested with placebo [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=169.84s)]
*  or saying vaccines can, the MMR vaccine contains aborted fetal material. It's absolute nonsense. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=176.8s)]
*  And so it's all wrong. And it's every few days. It's consistent. There's two things here. I mean, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=182.96s)]
*  one is being wrong on the facts and how destructive it is to be wrong on the facts, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=189.84s)]
*  both when you oversee the nation's health infrastructure, which he is currently dismantling, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=194.0s)]
*  like in the actual guts of budget cuts and things like that, and scientists and clinical trials, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=198.32s)]
*  and also the public messaging. But then there's something deeper and more pernicious to me, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=203.44s)]
*  even below that, which is a worldview that frankly feels unsettlingly eugenicist. And I want to play [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=207.76s)]
*  something he said about measles that I found to be one of the most disturbing things I've heard [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=215.28s)]
*  from a public official. He's talking about measles. Take a listen to what he says. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  No kid should die of measles in this country, even in 1963. For the introduction of the vaccine, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=226.32s)]
*  there were 400 deaths a year and there were up to 2 million measles cases. So it's only very, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=232.88s)]
*  very sick kids should die from measles and nobody should. And your big point is a choice, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=239.44s)]
*  a choice for people to make informed choice. Exactly. And that whatever your choice is, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=245.04s)]
*  you're human, you're entitled to compassion, you're entitled to the best quality health care, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=251.28s)]
*  and nobody should die of measles. So he says three times he says nobody should die of measles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=256.96s)]
*  He says no kid should die of measles. Nobody should die. Nobody should. Nobody should die of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=262.64s)]
*  measles. But sandwiched in there, there's a sentence he says, and I think he catches himself. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=266.8s)]
*  He says 400 deaths a year in 1963 from 2 million cases. So it's only very, very sick kids that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=271.12s)]
*  should die from measles. And then he realizes what he said and said nobody should. But when he cites [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=277.68s)]
*  as positive, hey, only 400 deaths in 1963, I found that an appalling thing to say. What is your [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=283.68s)]
*  reaction? Well, particularly Chris in West Texas, we've had now two measles deaths and perfectly well [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=289.76s)]
*  school-aged kids whose only problem was their parents made an executive decision not to vaccinate [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=296.96s)]
*  them with the MMR vaccine. So to say that in the middle of two measles deaths and this raging [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  epidemic that's been going on since January to the point where if this continues, we could even [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=308.0s)]
*  lose our measles elimination status in the United States. This is a big epidemic. It's gone from [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=313.12s)]
*  West Texas up into the panhandle into Kansas and Oklahoma, neighboring New Mexico. It's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=317.92s)]
*  spreading across the Great Plains. And yet he continues to minimize the measles and continues [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  to exaggerate the very, very rare side effects. That's been his modus operandi ever since I've [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=332.0s)]
*  known him. You've known him for a long time. You've engaged with him for over a year on the question [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  of vaccines and autism. You have a daughter with autism, which you've written very movingly about. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=342.88s)]
*  One of the things they've been doing is both characterizing autism in a really unnerving way, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=348.88s)]
*  unsettling way, offensive way to many. Also talking about a national autism registry. What do you think [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  about that? Well, it's the fact that he talks about kids on the autism spectrum in such dark terms. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  He says they need assistance forever in using the toilet. They don't work. They don't pay taxes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=366.56s)]
*  My daughter Rachel is an adult now. She works at Goodwill Industries. She gets a paycheck. She pays [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=374.56s)]
*  taxes. She's happy. She has friends at work. She goes to the movies. She does have intellectual [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=380.32s)]
*  disabilities, but a full life. But he always talks about it in such dark terms. Then he tried to walk [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=388.08s)]
*  it back a couple of days later and said, no, no, I was only talking about the 25%. And I don't know [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=393.92s)]
*  where he gets the 25% number either. And then to talk about that in the context of a registry, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=399.04s)]
*  which doesn't even make any sense because that registry is not going to have the two known causes [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=406.56s)]
*  of autism, which we have over 100 autism genes identified. And there are environmental factors [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=412.56s)]
*  that are associated with it. For instance, if you're pregnant and not aware of it on an [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=420.24s)]
*  antiseizure medication called Depakote, valproic acid, it interacts with autism genes and you're [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=424.96s)]
*  far more likely to be born with an autism phenotype. And I had those discussions with [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=430.56s)]
*  him back in 2017 when the NIH asked me to speak with him. And he had no interest in it. I said, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=435.68s)]
*  Bobby, I was calling him Bobby then. I won't tell you what he was calling me. But I said, Bobby, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  you should be all over this. You're an environmental attorney. This is your sweet spot. This is your [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  moment. And no interest. But then two weeks ago, he talks about he positions himself as someone is [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=452.96s)]
*  the keeper of looking at environmental causes. He says the scientific community is only saying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  that it's due to changes in autism diagnostic criteria, which I do think is responsible for a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  lot of it. But there are environmental exposures. And I can never engage him on it. Now he's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=472.79999999999995s)]
*  completely switching around. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiap4dmA_A&t=478.71999999999997s)]
