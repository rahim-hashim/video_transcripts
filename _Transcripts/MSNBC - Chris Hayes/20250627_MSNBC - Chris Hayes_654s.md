# ‘You’re wrong!’: George Conway, Melissa Murray debate Supreme Court injunction ruling
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU)
*  Melissa Murray is a professor at NYU Law School. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=0.0s)]
*  George Conway is a conservative attorney [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=3.0s)]
*  and the president of the Society for the Rule of Law. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=5.04s)]
*  They join me now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=7.44s)]
*  Thanks to both of you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=8.9s)]
*  Melissa, I wanna start with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=10.28s)]
*  You were, I think, on air when this ruling came out, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=12.72s)]
*  if I recall correctly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=16.04s)]
*  What was your reaction to that when you heard the news? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  And what do you think this means in general [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=22.18s)]
*  for the civil rights of Americans in this country? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=24.52s)]
*  So it wasn't an unexpected ruling. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=27.74s)]
*  It was very clear from oral arguments back in May [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=29.58s)]
*  that there was certainly some antipathy, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=31.86s)]
*  if not downright hostility, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=33.78s)]
*  toward the possibility of nationwide injunctions, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=35.44s)]
*  that there was some significant cadre of the court [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=37.54s)]
*  that were ready to rein this in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=39.94s)]
*  And so I wanna be clear about what this decision does [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=41.58s)]
*  and what it doesn't do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=44.22s)]
*  It does not take up the substantive question [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=45.58s)]
*  of whether section one of the 14th Amendment [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=47.94s)]
*  confers birthright citizenship. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=50.3s)]
*  So that was actually never on the table. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=51.84s)]
*  The Trump administration chose not to present that question [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=54.18s)]
*  to the court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=58.42s)]
*  And that by itself is significant [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=59.26s)]
*  because it understood this case to be purely a vehicle [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=60.1s)]
*  for narrowing the injunctive power of lower federal courts [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=63.42s)]
*  to stop this administration when it does lawless [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=67.62s)]
*  and unconstitutional actions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  And the court essentially delivered that today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=72.14s)]
*  They narrowed the available remedies [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=74.38s)]
*  that district courts can use [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=77.1s)]
*  when they are faced with the lawless actions of this court. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=78.6s)]
*  It said here that in this particular case [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=80.74s)]
*  and in others like it, if there is a litigant [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=83.38s)]
*  and that litigants relief can be afforded [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=86.22s)]
*  simply by giving that one litigant relief, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=88.74s)]
*  you don't necessarily need [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=92.1s)]
*  to have a broader nationwide solution. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=93.62s)]
*  So it didn't foreclose entirely the possibility [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=96.12s)]
*  of nationwide injunctions, but it made it much narrower [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=98.58s)]
*  and much harder for district courts [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=101.66s)]
*  to justify issuing a nationwide injunction. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=103.52s)]
*  And that's really critical because right now, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=106.22s)]
*  when we have Congress sitting on the couch somewhere [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=108.88s)]
*  in Washington, DC, there are precious few checks [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=111.18s)]
*  on this administration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  And we have been relying on the lower federal courts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  using their injunctive powers to stop this administration [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=118.7s)]
*  when it does something that is utterly lawless [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=122.78s)]
*  and utterly unconstitutional, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=124.94s)]
*  which has happened with increasing frequency. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=126.46s)]
*  How do you think other judges on lower courts, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=128.74s)]
*  which was once the position of these Supreme Court justices [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=131.72s)]
*  feel about their powers being clipped here? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=135.78s)]
*  To be clear, most of the justices on this court [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  were never district court judges. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=143.42s)]
*  Only two, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=146.22s)]
*  were ever on the district court. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=148.46s)]
*  The others were federal appellate judges. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  And in this particular opinion, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=152.18s)]
*  there was so much antipathy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=154.56s)]
*  for the work of district court judges. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=156.06s)]
*  District court judges, I've clerked for one, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=157.82s)]
*  they work and labor really hard. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=159.98s)]
*  They try to do the right thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=161.74s)]
*  And they recognize that they are the front lines. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=162.88s)]
*  They are closest to the litigants. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=165.3s)]
*  They often see the litigants in a way [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=166.5s)]
*  that appellate judges like the Supreme Court do not. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=167.98s)]
*  And the antipathy for district court judges [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=170.94s)]
*  was absolutely striking in this opinion. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=173.34s)]
*  Justice Kavanaugh and his concurrence essentially said, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=176.1s)]
*  the buck stops with us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=178.5s)]
*  We are the ones that get to make these decisions. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=179.66s)]
*  If there is an Imperial judiciary, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=182.3s)]
*  and that was a point of contention [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  between Justices Barrett and Jackson, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=185.9s)]
*  at least for Justice Kavanaugh, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=188.22s)]
*  the most Imperial judiciary [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=189.66s)]
*  is these nine members of the Supreme Court. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=191.3s)]
*  George, a lot of commentators today, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=195.1s)]
*  and in fact, Justice Katanji Brown Jackson in her dissent, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=197.54s)]
*  are saying that this leaves everyday people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=201.5s)]
*  to effectively fend for themselves [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=203.82s)]
*  when it comes to government infringements of their rights. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=206.04s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=211.14s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=214.38s)]
*  I don't think this decision is a big decision, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=215.22s)]
*  a big significant decision at all [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=217.06s)]
*  for most of the people watching out there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=219.24s)]
*  I think it's gonna be an interesting decision [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=221.58s)]
*  for students of the federal rules of civil procedure [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=223.6s)]
*  and class action procedure. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=226.16s)]
*  But I don't think it's gonna have much of an impact. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think the decision is actually correct, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=229.7s)]
*  much as I agree with everyone [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=232.26s)]
*  that what the administration here is trying to do [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=235.22s)]
*  to the 14th Amendment, Section 1, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=238.14s)]
*  is pretty much that it is a depraved [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  and insane interpretation of the 14th Amendment [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=243.42s)]
*  that only the likes of President Stephen Miller [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=247.33999999999997s)]
*  could come up with. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=249.66s)]
*  I mean, essentially what the court basic, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=250.56s)]
*  this is the equivalent of going to the DMV [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  or going to the passport office [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=255.42s)]
*  and coming up, showing up at the window with your form [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=257.48s)]
*  and being told, no, sorry, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=259.92s)]
*  you have to fill out a different form. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=261.44s)]
*  And the form's over there on the table [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=263.0s)]
*  and there are pens on the table [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=264.76s)]
*  and you have to just come back. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  And what happened here is Justice, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=267.56s)]
*  Justice Barrow is absolutely right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=270.04s)]
*  This is not a traditional form of injunction. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=272.56s)]
*  The way you get an injunction of the sort that had, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  sorts that have been issued here is through a class action. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=276.8s)]
*  And I know that sounds burdensome, it sounds big. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=279.88s)]
*  And I know if I'm, you know, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=282.72s)]
*  I practice class action law as a defense lawyer [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=283.68s)]
*  and it's very, very difficult to get, you know, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=286.44s)]
*  to deal with class certification issues [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  in a big case involving antitrust and securities [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=290.68s)]
*  and things where you have to hire experts and so on. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=294.0s)]
*  This is the most pure form of class action [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=296.52s)]
*  where basically it's up or down on the interpretation [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=299.0s)]
*  of a few words in the constitution, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=302.32s)]
*  which I think can't be interpreted any other way [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=304.04s)]
*  than the way that these judges and the plaintiffs [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=306.8s)]
*  have found it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  And so what's gonna happen here, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=310.0s)]
*  the reason why we saw multiple lawsuits [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=311.12s)]
*  brought this afternoon is 10 weeks ago [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=313.8s)]
*  when the Supreme Court decided to hear argument [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=317.04s)]
*  on this stay application, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=318.6s)]
*  everybody realized which way it was gonna go. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=320.2s)]
*  So they just wrote new pleadings that said, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=321.72s)]
*  we're gonna ask for a class action. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=323.68s)]
*  And what's going to happen next is the courts are gonna say, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  yeah, okay, we're gonna certify class actions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=327.92s)]
*  And frankly, there is no basis to oppose [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=330.56s)]
*  the certification of a class action here [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=334.12s)]
*  because it is so simple. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=335.68s)]
*  It's one issue of law, it's straight up or down. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=336.88s)]
*  And we're gonna have four law, you know, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=340.48s)]
*  it may be not perfectly nationwide injunction, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=342.8s)]
*  but four very broad injunctions, maybe even nationwide [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=345.48s)]
*  that are just simply gonna be issued in class actions, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=348.72s)]
*  which eliminates the problem. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=351.24s)]
*  And so I think we're just gonna end up in a very short quarter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=353.56s)]
*  Melissa has been vigorously shaking her head for a while. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  Because George, you are wrong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=359.56s)]
*  You are wrong. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=361.0s)]
*  And you know you are wrong. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  First of all, this case, Trump versus Casa [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=363.0s)]
*  involves not just individual litigants, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=365.36s)]
*  but also states as litigants. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=367.44s)]
*  And you know as a lawyer, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  that the federal rules of civil procedure [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=370.32s)]
*  do not permit states and organizations like Casa [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=371.88s)]
*  to present themselves as candidates for class actions. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=374.6s)]
*  Federal rule of civil procedure number 23 [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=377.36s)]
*  only applies to persons. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=379.56s)]
*  So the idea that anyone could go forward as a class action [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=380.92s)]
*  is absolutely ludicrous and you know that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=384.68s)]
*  This was the only remedy available to lower federal judges [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  to reign in this particular administration. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  Now we are asking individual litigants [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=394.12s)]
*  to either go to every district court throughout the country [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=396.04s)]
*  to individually file suit or to alternatively [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=398.44s)]
*  launch a broad class action [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=401.04s)]
*  for which many of them don't have the resources. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=403.04s)]
*  And right now, at a time when this administration [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=404.92s)]
*  has forced law firms to capitulate, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=407.92s)]
*  further narrowing the availability of legal resources, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=410.0s)]
*  the fact of a class action is going to be virtually impossible [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=412.96s)]
*  and you know that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=415.96s)]
*  This is a devastating decision for the rule of law. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=417.16s)]
*  It is a devastating decision for the rule of law. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=419.96s)]
*  It is a devastating decision for democracy [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=422.88s)]
*  and it is part and parcel of this court [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=425.6s)]
*  that has for the last two years [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=428.08s)]
*  facilitated this president in what has been [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  an utterly lawless march through constitutional law. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  George, giving your chance to respond. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=437.04s)]
*  I admire you and I love you [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=437.88s)]
*  and I agree with a lot of what you say, but your role. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  Federal rule of civil procedure 23B2 basically says [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  this is exactly the kind of case [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=446.2s)]
*  where a class action should be certified. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=447.8s)]
*  And yes, states can't ask for it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=449.76s)]
*  Not with organizations like CASA, George. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=451.68s)]
*  There are individuals, excuse me, excuse me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=453.68s)]
*  Individuals can bring large class actions here [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=457.52s)]
*  and the states have every right to seek a relief [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=461.52s)]
*  that affects them, which means people who are moving [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=465.76s)]
*  into the state, people are in the state. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=468.96s)]
*  So we're gonna get full and full relief [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=470.68s)]
*  in very, very short order. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=473.76s)]
*  And I don't think this case is gonna make a big difference [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=475.2s)]
*  in any of these cases where the government is violating. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=477.6s)]
*  Yes, it's an up or down issue as to whether or not [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=482.96s)]
*  the government is violating the law [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=485.56s)]
*  and everybody's similarly affected. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=487.44s)]
*  There is a mechanism for doing this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=489.64s)]
*  It's rule 23B2 and that's where we're gonna end up [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=491.52s)]
*  and I think we're gonna end up in the same place. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=493.96s)]
*  We'll come back in a matter of weeks [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=496.84s)]
*  and we'll see who's right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, okay, before we get too in the weeds [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=499.36s)]
*  on some of these particular provisions, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=501.08s)]
*  I do wanna ask what this means in practice [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=503.68s)]
*  for people who are affected by this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=507.24s)]
*  So Melissa, my question to you is effectively, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=509.96s)]
*  what happens to babies born in states [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=513.28s)]
*  where the birthright citizenship executive order [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=516.72s)]
*  is not being blocked? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=521.48s)]
*  Like what is, there are some states where babies [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=523.64s)]
*  are born citizens and there are some states [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=526.04s)]
*  where babies are not born citizens, maybe they're stateless. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=528.04s)]
*  What happens if you're born in a, you know, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=531.68s)]
*  if you're a parent and you have a kid [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=534.28s)]
*  who's born in Texas, let's say? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=535.54s)]
*  So there's a 30 day kind of delay [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=537.48s)]
*  before this opinion becomes operative. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=540.04s)]
*  That gives the administration an opportunity [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=542.36s)]
*  to draft some guidance for how this will all play out [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=544.28s)]
*  in the various jurisdictions, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=548.0s)]
*  both where it is blocked and where it is not. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=549.64s)]
*  But we are looking toward what will essentially be [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=551.76s)]
*  a kind of patchwork in the United States [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=554.66s)]
*  and that shouldn't be unfamiliar. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  With this administration, we've seen patchworks before. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=558.24s)]
*  Consider the Dobbs decision from just a few years ago [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=560.84s)]
*  where we went from having a fundamental right [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=563.66s)]
*  to choose an abortion to having a patchwork [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=566.0s)]
*  where we have some states where it's permitted [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=568.84s)]
*  and other states where it isn't. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=570.28s)]
*  So it is going to be chaotic. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=571.48s)]
*  It is going to be uncertain and unsettled [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  and that kind of chaos is, I think, by design [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=575.96s)]
*  to make it less likely for individuals to come forward [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=580.04s)]
*  to claim their rights, to make it less likely [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=583.12s)]
*  for individuals to come to the United States [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=585.38s)]
*  and to make it more likely that people will be unwilling [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=587.88s)]
*  to live with this kind of uncertainty [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=590.76s)]
*  and will self-deport or otherwise take themselves [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=592.64s)]
*  out of this situation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=595.2s)]
*  The babies are gonna self-deport? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=596.64s)]
*  Well, I guess, according to George, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  some babies are gonna go get lawyers and file class actions. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=600.4s)]
*  George, very quickly, last word to you before we wrap up. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=604.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, I think we're gonna end up [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=609.4s)]
*  with coverage nationwide very soon [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=611.52s)]
*  because there are gonna be multiple lawsuits, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=614.92s)]
*  multiple class actions, and there are gonna be [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=616.4s)]
*  broad injunctions issued against this unlawful [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=617.84s)]
*  and outrageous interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=620.4s)]
*  Melissa Murray and George Conway, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=624.08s)]
*  thank you both for your perspectives. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=625.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQnaovrlESU&t=630.36s)]
