# ‘Spooked’: Trump officials hoarding supplies over shortage fears, Rolling Stone reports
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc)
*  We have some exciting programming news to share this Saturday, 6 p.m. Eastern MSNBC will be premiering a brand new show, appropriately titled The Weekend Prime Time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's on The Weekend's in Prime Time. It will be hosted by four very familiar faces from this network, a good friend Eamon Mulhall Deane, Antonia Hilton, Katherine Rampel, and Elise Jordan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=9.0s)]
*  And it's gearing up for its great first broadcast. I'm joined now by two of those familiar faces, Elise Jordan and Katherine Rampel. It's good to have you both here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=17.0s)]
*  I feel like I had you both on up maybe at this table like 13 years ago, possibly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, you know what I've said so many times? I've said up with Chris Hayes as a model. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=29.0s)]
*  I really do remember you would bring us in. It would be a super smart, wonky topic. We'd spend 20 minutes on it and everyone left smarter and it became a look at you now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=34.0s)]
*  Well, it's true. I want to ask you, Elise. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=45.0s)]
*  I want to start on the Walls News today because you actually worked in the National Security Council, which is this strange entity in the government that people outside know nothing about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=51.0s)]
*  But then as soon as you get into the White House and the government, it turns out to be basically the most important part of the government. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=58.0s)]
*  Well, think about how unwieldy everything is now and how many different intelligence apparatus we have and different government seeking missions here and there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=65.0s)]
*  And that is the one organ that coordinates it all within government. And so you have to be so detail-oriented. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=74.0s)]
*  It is a time drain. You are overseeing and you're making everyone get along too. And you're solving all these interagency problems. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=80.0s)]
*  So now Marco Rubio is expected to do that and to run the State Department, which kind of has a lot going on around the world too. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah. Ben Rhodes, who we talked to earlier, who had been a deputy at the National Security Council was like, this is ridiculous. He can't do it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=95.0s)]
*  He also is the acting administrator of aid, which they're trying to cut and also National Archives just to throw that in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=102.0s)]
*  But as someone who did work in there, do you agree with Ben that it's ludicrous to have him have both these jobs, National Security Advisor and Secretary? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=107.0s)]
*  It makes absolutely no sense when there are plenty of Americans, plenty of national security experts who could fill such a role. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=115.0s)]
*  It shows, though, I think how Trump is relying on such a small brain trust for foreign policy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=123.0s)]
*  Is it really going to be Marco Rubio at the end of the day who he's relying on? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=129.0s)]
*  It remains to be seen. Marco Rubio's foreign policy views were diametrically opposed to Donald Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=134.0s)]
*  Like completely the opposite in every way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=140.0s)]
*  Exactly. How do you flip from being a pro-democracy, human rights supporter, very gung-ho for foreign intervention to now just quietly going along with Trump? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=142.0s)]
*  I want to ask you, Catherine, about this great bit of reporting from Rolling Stone today about the tariffs and about preparations that are happening. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=154.0s)]
*  I'm sure this has happened to you and people you know that people have been like front loading their consumption. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=162.0s)]
*  I'm hearing from new newly evolved preppers and hoarders. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=167.0s)]
*  Yes, exactly. And it has a little bit of that texture of the early covid days of like, oh, go get all the paper towels. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=172.0s)]
*  This is a great bit of reporting in Rolling Stone. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=177.0s)]
*  Well, to be fair, Doge has also been responsible for toilet paper shortages at some of the federal agencies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=208.0s)]
*  Oh, that's true. Yes, because they cut off some contracts. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=216.0s)]
*  Yes. So I think we've talked about this before. So even without the tariffs, people might be worried about their paper products. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=218.0s)]
*  But in this case, like again, all this is so strange because we're in this period of uncertainty because of the lag that happens with supply chains. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=224.0s)]
*  So we're all kind of pacing out what this is going to be. There was a bunch of bulk ordering that happened. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=231.0s)]
*  We got the first ship today sort of arriving, I think, or the last ship that's like pre-tariff. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=235.0s)]
*  But it does seem like we're going to experience some real consumer disruption. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=241.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Not only because prices are likely to go up, but because we're going to have vacant shelves probably pretty soon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=246.0s)]
*  A lot of the stocking up that's happened has happened with these durable goods, things that are not perishable. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=254.0s)]
*  Right. Washing machines or furniture, things like that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=261.0s)]
*  The real pain that's going to come sooner is going to be on things that companies can't stock up on, like groceries. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=265.0s)]
*  Right. So for whatever reason, Donald Trump put a new tariff on tomatoes, Mexican tomatoes, quite recently. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=271.0s)]
*  So that will have an effect. It will show up very soon at the grocery store. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=277.0s)]
*  So consumers are going to feel this pretty quickly. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=282.0s)]
*  With regard to that Rolling Stone article, I wish these staffers, these anonymous aides in the Trump administration, would tell Trump that they are doing this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=285.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. Because he has completely dismissed all of these concerns. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=294.0s)]
*  Well, and this is something that unites both, I think, the tariff, trade war, domestic policy, and foreign policy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=297.0s)]
*  It really does seem there is the whole value proposition of all these people around Trump this time around was there's no one to tell him no. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=305.0s)]
*  He doesn't like being told no. We're seeing what it looks like when no one tells him no. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=312.0s)]
*  Sometimes he backs off stuff. But that is the kind of unifying thread here, that there's no one telling him you can't do that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=315.0s)]
*  Well, and also just the nonsense that's put in his brain every day. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=322.0s)]
*  I mean, we've all read about Natalie Hart following him around with the printer and how he doesn't even really get mainstream media that he actually loves and he wants to do interviews with. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=326.0s)]
*  He doesn't see it. Right. It's a garbage in, garbage out situation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=336.0s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, where the origins of the garbage are a little unclear. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=339.0s)]
*  I think sometimes they are coming from outside his brain into it. Sometimes they're coming from inside his brain out into the world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=343.0s)]
*  Like the tariff stuff is that's like him. 100%. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=350.0s)]
*  Yes. He has loved tariffs. He's been a tariff man since at least the 80s. He's obsessed with tariffs. He doesn't know why he's obsessed with tariffs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=354.0s)]
*  Maybe it's because of the revenue. Maybe it's a negotiating play. Who knows? All of these objectives are at odds. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=361.0s)]
*  I think it's also whoever has his ear most recently who may be acting in their own self-interest. Right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=366.0s)]
*  There are plenty of people who stand to get rich because of this administration's policies if they can get in touch with Donald Trump at the right time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=372.0s)]
*  Maybe someone can make the case against the trade war to Laura Loomer and then we can get it via law. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=380.0s)]
*  That's how you nailed it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=386.0s)]
*  I could tell the president, at least Jordan and Catherine Brantell. Thank you both. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=388.0s)]
*  Be sure to watch the premiere of The Weekend Prime Time this Saturday at 6 p.m. Eastern right here on MSNBC. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAm6rQ4_yPc&t=391.0s)]
