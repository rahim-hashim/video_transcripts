# Trump can’t bully and lie his way out of higher prices and empty shelves, says Hayes
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. You know for all the talk about what the media got wrong about the last election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=0.0s)]
*  How it failed to communicate the stakes for democracy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  I actually think people were pretty well warned that Donald Trump would govern as an authoritarian [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=7.3s)]
*  The biggest miss to my mind was on tariffs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=13.72s)]
*  They went to my mind under reported and when they were reported [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=17.28s)]
*  No one believed you would do it even though Trump talked about it all the time [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=20.68s)]
*  Although I should note [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=25.0s)]
*  You would not have been surprised about the tariffs if you were a regular viewer of this program where we talked about a lot [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=26.32s)]
*  We warned about them all the time starting all the way back in January of 2024 [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=31.44s)]
*  Now how many Americans of by contrast know that Trump? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=37.18s)]
*  2024 platform includes a 10% tax a 10% tax on all products imported into this country [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=41.16s)]
*  Everything think of all the things are imported which would make everyday goods like [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Considerably more expensive that 10% tax thing the 10% tariff like I'm gonna bet that's the first time you heard and again [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna cover this right? I mean in the campaign Trump effectively said this yes America [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=63.0s)]
*  I know your number one issue is prices are too high, but don't you worry. I'm gonna bring them down day one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=68.06s)]
*  By raising prices on everything imported [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=74.02000000000001s)]
*  That was his pitch in a nutshell. It made no sense at the time. It makes no sense now, but here we are [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump inherited an economy that was quite literally the envy of the world and he's basically tried to destroy it in just a hundred days [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=83.9s)]
*  All in pursuit of this one issue tariffs that he's been absolutely obsessed with dating back at least 40 years [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  He thinks that his own force of will is so powerful that he could overcome reality itself [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=96.98s)]
*  He insisted during the campaign and insists now that American consumers will not pay the tariffs that the the foreigners those those [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=103.18s)]
*  Exporting countries will that is not true [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=111.44s)]
*  Everyone on Wall Street and in Washington and every economics department in the country has been running around screaming this for a month [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=114.88s)]
*  It's an import tax. It's a sales tax on imports Trump thinks he can keep this going like Wiley Coyote when he runs off [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=121.28s)]
*  The cliff and doesn't look down [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=127.88s)]
*  But the data is coming in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=129.88s)]
*  Prices are going up. Here's a great example. Look at the popular Chinese e-commerce retailer Tmoo [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Sells a bunch of clothes tchotchkes at very low prices with the caveat that you are importing them directly from China [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=138.68s)]
*  Thanks to Trump's tariffs importing a bunch of cheap stuff directly from China. Just got a lot more expensive [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=145.92s)]
*  So Tmoo Chinese own firm added a line during checkout to show exactly how much Trump's tariffs are costing you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=150.76s)]
*  CNBC ran the experiment here [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=158.44s)]
*  It is $30 to purchase two items of clothing from Tmoo free shipping and then [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=159.88s)]
*  $45 in import fees those being Trump's tariffs meaning your $30 order is now [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=164.64s)]
*  $75 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=171.68s)]
*  See to be very clear here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=172.84s)]
*  China's not paying those tariffs Tmoo sure as heck isn't paying them. You are paying those tariffs, of course [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=175.32s)]
*  This morning there were then follow-up reports that Amazon might consider something similar for some products at their store a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=181.44s)]
*  Price line telling you exactly how much Trump's tariffs are costing you and well the White House went absolutely ballistic [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=189.36s)]
*  I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon's announcement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a hostile and political act by Amazon [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=200.12s)]
*  Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  Hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years and I would also add that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not a surprise because as Reuters recently wrote [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=212.96s)]
*  Amazon Amazon has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm. So this is another reason why Americans should buy American [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=216.56s)]
*  Now around the time of that briefing Donald Trump actually called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to yell at him about the reported plan to basically [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=224.8s)]
*  Show the American people again how much Trump's tariffs raise their prices and guess what surprise surprise Bezos in Amazon cave [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  The company now says it was only considering adding the tariff line for its subservice Amazon Hall [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=238.34s)]
*  Which is direct competitor to sites like Tmoo where you import cheat goods directly from China [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  More importantly Amazon says it's not going to add the tariff line anymore. And well Trump was pleased [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=248.04s)]
*  Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=256.32s)]
*  He did the right thing and it's a good guy [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=263.32s)]
*  It's always nice when a couple of billionaires get together to hide the cost of prices from people who are buying stuff [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=266.32s)]
*  But look Jeff Bezos understands the score, right? Here's the thing Donald Trump wants direct control over the American economy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  It's really striking the degree to which this is not a person who believes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=280.2s)]
*  even in principle in free markets [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=284.48s)]
*  He doesn't like free markets. He basically wants a planned economy controlled by him. That's how he describes the economy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=287.8s)]
*  That means he's allowed to run the country like a kind of corrupt mafia state right where he shakes down big companies [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  He views his adversaries. He cuts sweetheart deals to his friends [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=299.24s)]
*  His own Commerce Secretary effectively agreed that even talking about the tariffs is an attack on the White House [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=302.88s)]
*  If a company were to say we're raising prices because the terror is that a hostile act? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=309.88s)]
*  I think if you go out of your way to try to make it seem like your price has changed when it's nonsense [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=314.92s)]
*  Okay, a 10% tariff. Why is that nonsense? Because a 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=321.92s)]
*  The only price it would change would be a product that we don't make here like a mango [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=328.56s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=334.0s)]
*  First of all people will absolutely notice their prices rise by 10% [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=335.72s)]
*  Second, it's not just 10% from China, right? It's 10% for everyone [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=339.88s)]
*  We're still waiting on all the other terrorists which are postponed, but I'm trying it's a hundred and forty five percent [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=344.72s)]
*  I think people will notice that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=350.0s)]
*  That aside Jeff Bezos gets how the administration's operating so he's not going to tell you about the Trump tax directly [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=352.04s)]
*  But again, this is really key listen to this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  It's still going to cost a hundred and forty five percent more to import things from China [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  Whether or not Amazon explicitly tells you what is happening [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=364.88000000000005s)]
*  It's exactly the same thing tried to try to do back during kovat [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  Remember where he just hated all the testing and he tried to keep the testing numbers artificially low so that there would be fewer reported cases [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  But again, this is just so crucial that didn't actually mean fewer cases [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=380.0s)]
*  It didn't mean less virus spreading it was still spreading people still notice when they got sick and when loved ones died [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=385.36s)]
*  So Trump can say whatever he wants he can bully Jeff Bezos [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=393.72s)]
*  He could try to sign an executive order that it's illegal in America to note that the terrorists are costing you money [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=397.68s)]
*  But like it will be the case that shipping containers will be empty. We know that that's happening [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=404.04s)]
*  It will be the case that prices are higher [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=408.72s)]
*  No amount of lying and bullying can change certain facts about the world [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=410.68s)]
*  That we really learned this during kovat. We learned it again after Trump lost the 2020 election January 6 and here we are again [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  Can't overcome some aspects of reality and a hundred days in everyone's gonna start feeling the impact of this Trump sales tax [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  You [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxju8KpR2U&t=443.72s)]
