# 'Deportation of dissent': Aussie writer deported after reporting on Gaza protests
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w)
*  Now the Trump administration is restarting the processing of student visas. They're also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=0.0s)]
*  digging through applicants' social media accounts to root out anyone who has criticized the U.S. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=5.92s)]
*  government, which is a practice we really only see in like the most restrictive regimes. And that's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=10.96s)]
*  now happening here in the U.S. And the only word to describe the turn it's taken in this one story [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=15.52s)]
*  I'm about to share with you is totalitarian. This story is in the New Yorker. It reads, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=20.96s)]
*  How my reporting on the Columbia protests led to my deportation. It's by Columbia MFA student Alistair [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=26.64s)]
*  Kitchin. Kitchin says that customs and border protection targeted him at the LA airport over [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=32.32s)]
*  a substack he wrote about Columbia students protesting Israel's war on Gaza. He went through [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=38.24s)]
*  two separate CBP interviews. He was interrogated on his views on Israel-Palestine. He says he was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=43.6s)]
*  held in detention for hours. Quote, They were waiting for me when I got off the plane. A CBP [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=48.8s)]
*  agent intercepted me before I entered primary processing and took me immediately into an [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=53.68s)]
*  interrogation room in the back where he took my phone and demanded my passcode. When I refused, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=58.32s)]
*  I was told I would be immediately sent back home if I did not comply. So I complied. He was ultimately [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=63.12s)]
*  sent back to Australia anyway. A CBP spokesperson claims Kitchin was denied entry because he gave [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  false information on his visa waiver application. Alistair Kitchin joins me now from Australia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=74.56s)]
*  Alistair, thanks for joining and I've got to say this. I've been sharing this account because I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=81.44s)]
*  find it so unbelievable what happened to you. So you've been a student at Columbia in the MFA [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=85.2s)]
*  program. You'd written a substack on the protest, sort of your chronicling of it. You were sympathetic [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  to the protests. You come to the US planning for a trip. You get the right paperwork. You land in LAX. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=95.84s)]
*  You get pulled immediately. Then what happens? Then I get taken into a bathroom. As you said, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=103.44s)]
*  my phone was demanded and my passcode was demanded. I was told that if I didn't hand it over, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=110.48s)]
*  I would be put on the next plane home. Now I complied. The reason I complied is that, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=116.56s)]
*  frankly, no one ever read my blog anyway. I was worried, of course, that the United States would [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  be concerned about students that had studied at Columbia. But I never expected that my substack [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=128.72s)]
*  would be cause for attention. Nonetheless, I had taken those posts down. I had taken them down [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=134.96s)]
*  42 to 72 hours before I got on the plane. So by the time I got taken to secondary processing and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=141.84s)]
*  my phone was demanded from it, it was already too late. They had already read my information [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=149.44s)]
*  and they had already marked me for interrogation. The CBP agent who's interrogating you says, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  look, we both know why you are here. It's because of what you wrote online about the protests at [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=161.52s)]
*  Columbia University. And then proceeds a genuinely insane ideological interrogation, essentially, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=166.0s)]
*  like about the granular specifics of your individual views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=175.12s)]
*  That's exactly right. Ideological interrogation is exactly the right term. They wanted to know [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=184.56s)]
*  what my thoughts were. And frankly, they wanted to police those thoughts. And I felt in that moment [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=189.84s)]
*  that how I answered about what I believe would be the marker of whether or not I made it into the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=195.76s)]
*  United States. And I can tell you exactly what I told them, which is that I feel that this is a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=202.16s)]
*  horrific conflict that needs to be and can be brought to an immediate end. I was asked to name [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=208.32s)]
*  you know, students that I studied with. I was asked to name protesters that I observed. But [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=215.2s)]
*  the entire time, I was trying to remind them that while I was at the protests day in, day out, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=220.56s)]
*  I understood myself to be there in the capacity as a writer, as a journalist. Sympathetic, no doubt, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=226.88s)]
*  to the protesters, but I was doing journalism. They get into like stuff about like, do you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=234.0s)]
*  support a two-state solution? Which again, like, they've called the guy off, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=240.56s)]
*  which is visiting the US around, he's like, they want to know your specific position on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=245.68s)]
*  the two-state solution. Yeah, that's exactly right. Look, I love America. I've been there [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=250.0s)]
*  many times. I was going there for two and a half weeks to like drink beers with my friends. And [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=256.0s)]
*  all of a sudden, I'm having this debate with a CBP officer who wants to know whether I think a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=260.32s)]
*  one or two-state solution is more plausible. He wants to know whether, how indeed Israel could [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=266.48s)]
*  bring this conflict to an end, because I insisted that they could. It was the most extraordinary [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  conversation that I have ever had. You have two rounds of this, I want to know, but I want to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=279.04s)]
*  get to this detail. They search your phone, and they make you go through your phone. And by all [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=283.44s)]
*  of like all of your phone, meaning I want you to tell us about the hidden folder that they make you [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=289.68s)]
*  unlock for them. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Every person, I think, watching this show will know [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=294.56s)]
*  that they have things on their phone that they would rather not share with officers of the United [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=301.12s)]
*  States government. I have a hidden folder on my phone, like many people do, which has photographs [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=305.44s)]
*  and personal information that I'd rather not share with anyone except my loved ones. Nonetheless, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=311.04s)]
*  on threat of deportation, I was made to unlock that folder. In front of me, the CBP officer [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=318.0s)]
*  scrolled through it. And so, no doubt, we were looking at pictures of me and pictures of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=323.2s)]
*  things that I would rather he had never seen. Naked pictures, essentially, of you. It's described [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=329.2s)]
*  very well. By the way, it's an excellent piece of writing on your part. Finally, after many hours, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=336.56s)]
*  two rounds of interrogation, you're basically sent back onto the plane. And this is wild, too. So you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=342.32s)]
*  have failed the ideological test. Or they don't like your pictures, I don't know. But I think the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=348.8s)]
*  ideological test. And then they give your phone to the staff who say, you know, you don't get it until [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=353.12s)]
*  you land? Is that what happens? Yeah, that's exactly right. They put your passport and your [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  phone into a sealed envelope. They hand it over to the flight attendant. And then, I don't know for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  sure, but as I understand it, the Trump administration requests of the airlines to withhold your [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=373.04s)]
*  goods until you arrive at your destination, which for me was 15 hours away in Melbourne, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  Australia. No one in Australia knew that I'd made it back onto the plane. No one knew where I was. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  And I landed in Australia feeling very alone. By the way, in that interrogation, they get you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  admit that you'd used marijuana. And that's ostensibly why you had lied on the application, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=397.36s)]
*  which is why they're deporting you. But it was all pretextual, at least as far as I can tell [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=402.0s)]
*  from your story. Alastair Kitchen, thank you for sharing your story. I really appreciate it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=405.2s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. Can you imagine? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=409.36s)]
*  you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkB9gTCZ1w&t=432.0s)]
