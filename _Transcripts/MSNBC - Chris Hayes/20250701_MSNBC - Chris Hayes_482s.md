# Trump again floats deporting U.S. citizens: ‘Maybe that’ll be the next job’
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g)
*  The disastrous decision by the Supreme Court four days ago that allows the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=0.0s)]
*  to begin implementing a flatly odious and unconstitutional order on birthright citizenship. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, today, the administration announced it will begin deporting people subject to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=11.84s)]
*  that order as soon as July 27th. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=16.96s)]
*  It's madness, but it is madness with a method, which is to deconstruct the foundational concept [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=20.6s)]
*  of what it is to be an American, a concept created in this country's second founding [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=28.0s)]
*  by the 14th Amendment and the victory of the Union, the Civil War, a belief that we are [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=33.44s)]
*  all Americans across all lines of difference from race to religion to creed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=39.04s)]
*  They hate that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=44.28s)]
*  They're trying to destroy it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=45.28s)]
*  Sherrilyn Ifill is the founding director of the 14th Amendment Center for Law and Democracy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=47.2s)]
*  at Howard University. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=51.28s)]
*  She was previously president and director counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=52.28s)]
*  She has a new piece out this week titled A Court Without the Range, the Reconstruction [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=57.4s)]
*  Court 2.0, and she joins me now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Sherrilyn, we are seeing a sustained attack on some of the foundational ideas of the reconstruction [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=65.16s)]
*  amendments. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=70.96s)]
*  None more foundational, I think, than this question of who belongs and who's a citizen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=72.52s)]
*  What do you make of what we are seeing now that the Supreme Court has paved the way to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=77.48s)]
*  begin some kind of patchwork implementation of this executive order? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=83.2s)]
*  Sherrilyn Thanks so much, Chris. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=89.0s)]
*  This is a danger of the highest order, a danger to our republic as we know it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=94.28s)]
*  You know, the conservatives on this court and conservatives in general have long pushed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=101.2s)]
*  back against the promise and the power of the 14th Amendment to our Constitution, which [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  was ratified in 1868 after the Civil War. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=111.68s)]
*  The purpose of the 14th Amendment was to ensure that black people, formerly enslaved and free, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  would be full citizens, but also was to reset our country and to center the principles of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  equality and justice in our country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=127.12s)]
*  And that's the project that they are pushing back against. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=130.36s)]
*  They have decided to go for that first sentence of the 14th Amendment, all persons born or [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=134.28s)]
*  naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  the United States and of the state in which they reside, what we call birthright citizenship. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=143.5s)]
*  Except it's very explicit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=148.38s)]
*  It's very explicit language in the Constitution. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=149.38s)]
*  You can't pretend you don't know what they mean, anyone born here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=151.64s)]
*  And the framers of that amendment were very well aware that it would mean that the children [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=155.28s)]
*  of migrants, the children of non-citizen workers who were born here, would also be citizens. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=159.5s)]
*  Nevertheless, over the course of the last 15 years, we have heard many Republicans talk [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=166.06s)]
*  about ending birthright citizenship. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=170.34s)]
*  And President Trump now has come up with a way, with the aid of the United States Supreme [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=172.64s)]
*  Court, to skirt around the plain language of the 14th Amendment to try and implement [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  something that looks like a carve-out from this most important and most vital constitutional [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  protection. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=189.22s)]
*  One of the things I think it's worth people getting their heads around—this is reporting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  in the New York Times—immigrant rights groups in 22 states, all of Democratic leadership [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=195.1s)]
*  have sued over the citizenship order. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  Three federal district courts vacated the policy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=201.46s)]
*  In 28 states that have not challenged the order, such as Arkansas, Mississippi, North [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=204.22s)]
*  Dakota, and Texas, the order can go into effect. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, there might be class actions that get certified. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=209.62s)]
*  But just to think about the practical reality of every hospital in America, or at least [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=212.78s)]
*  states, becoming the frontier of creating a second-class non-citizenship status that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=221.7s)]
*  they are administering to women coming screaming in labor pains. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  Remember, the core of our reset country through the 14th Amendment was that this is a country [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=237.5s)]
*  that has no case. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=244.82s)]
*  It has no levels of citizenship. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=246.42s)]
*  This is precisely what this administration is imagining. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=249.68s)]
*  And it's happening, Chris, at a time when we are watching masked ICE agents roll up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=252.84s)]
*  on people outside the Home Depot and wrestle them to the ground. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=256.96s)]
*  And we're watching them, you know, deport people and send people to third-party countries [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=260.48s)]
*  with which they have no connection. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=266.82s)]
*  Is that what is going to be happening to newborn babies who are born, who they believe fall [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=268.68s)]
*  under this executive order, which purports to deny birthright citizenship to those who [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=274.8s)]
*  don't have at least one parent who's a citizen or a permanent resident? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=279.72s)]
*  Are they going to be, as you say, outside maternity wards, these masked agents, or in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=283.68s)]
*  maternity wards, trying to take babies away from their parents or outside the homes of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=287.56s)]
*  new parents, trying to enforce this executive order? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=293.62s)]
*  This is beyond dystopian. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  It already has been dystopian. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  contrary to everything, not just that we believe in in this country, but that any decent country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=301.84s)]
*  premised on the idea of democracy believes in. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  The question is, will we allow it to happen? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=309.28s)]
*  The Supreme Court had to know they were given a green light to this, even though they have [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=311.28s)]
*  said, you know, there could be these class actions, which are aggregated cases where [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  lots of people come together and bring an action. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=320.0s)]
*  You know, as you point out, there are jurisdictions where federal courts very much disfavor class [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=322.28s)]
*  actions through the Fifth Circuit, for example, where individuals would have to bring their [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=327.1s)]
*  own case, find a lawyer, bring their case to be able to keep this EO from going into [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=332.3s)]
*  effect against them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=337.98s)]
*  I cannot imagine what we might be facing by the end of this month. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=339.54s)]
*  And so I think we have to gather ourselves and really recognize what is coming down the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=343.36s)]
*  pike. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=347.74s)]
*  And if we add it to Trump's comments today and earlier about his desire to move United [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=348.74s)]
*  States citizens who are imprisoned in this country to other countries, we are looking [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=354.3s)]
*  at something very, very, very horrifying, something we have really, frankly, never seen [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=359.18s)]
*  before in this country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=364.1s)]
*  And we're going to have to make some real decisions about where we draw the line. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=366.22s)]
*  The president today musing in case anyone thought this was really about citizenship [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  or immigration, musing today openly that actually there's people born here who are citizens [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=375.62s)]
*  that we should do the same thing through to deport them, move them out of the country, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=380.86s)]
*  render them to third party prisons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=385.62s)]
*  I mean, it seems to me that like this, there is no sacrosanct line here to defend in their [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=388.14s)]
*  view. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=394.38s)]
*  It is we are what you are and you have whatever rights we say you have. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=395.38s)]
*  Well, and you can guarantee that if you are a black or brown person, you have less rights [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=401.54s)]
*  than everyone else. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=407.42s)]
*  It will only be a matter of time before he extends this to people who are critics of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=408.74s)]
*  him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=413.18s)]
*  So race will at some point not be the line that is drawn anymore, but at least for now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=414.18s)]
*  If you are brown, if you are black, that's why he thinks going for the prisons will disproportionately [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=420.62s)]
*  give him that population. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=424.94s)]
*  That's why he's doing this around birthright citizenship. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=426.7s)]
*  You know, we just had a Supreme Court that has allowed him to go forward with excluding, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=429.54s)]
*  500,000 people from Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=435.78s)]
*  He's lifted TPS for Haitians. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=440.42s)]
*  So there are going to be all kinds of people who are potentially subject to this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=442.46s)]
*  But it's only a matter of time before it gets around to you are not a citizen if you [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=446.56s)]
*  criticize this government. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=450.58s)]
*  So this is what we feared. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=452.24s)]
*  It is happening. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8b0lrxFD9g&t=454.18s)]
