# ‘Kicked him out of town’: Elon Musk ‘leaving in disgrace’ after 4 chaotic months
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=0.0s)]
*  To put the news in the parlance of SpaceX, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=2.0s)]
*  it seems Elon Musk's career as co-president to Donald Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=5.0s)]
*  has had a bit of a rapid unscheduled disassembly. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=9.0s)]
*  Technically, it was kind of scheduled. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=12.0s)]
*  His Doge campaign was always billed as temporary. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=15.0s)]
*  But less than six months into this administration, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=18.0s)]
*  the man who came in like some kind of MAGA rock star [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=21.0s)]
*  who was jumping around at Trump rallies [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=24.0s)]
*  appeared in every cabinet meeting, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=26.0s)]
*  seemed to be running the cabinet meetings, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=28.0s)]
*  spoke to adoring crowds at CPOC, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=30.0s)]
*  is now unceremoniously slinking out the side door. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=32.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear here and be fair-minded, clear-eyed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=36.0s)]
*  By every conceivable metric, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=40.0s)]
*  Musk's stint in government has been an unmitigated abject failure. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=42.0s)]
*  Any way you look on it, on the substance, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=48.0s)]
*  it's just been wildly destructive. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=52.0s)]
*  And also volatile. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=54.0s)]
*  Remember like the, oh, it was the email to everyone? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=56.0s)]
*  What did you do? Three things. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=59.0s)]
*  And then they just abandoned that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=60.0s)]
*  A lot of lifelong experts in key positions in our federal government [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=62.0s)]
*  have lost their jobs and we can't get them back. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=66.0s)]
*  Important medical research. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=68.0s)]
*  I mean, groundbreaking stuff has been paused or destroyed, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=69.0s)]
*  possibly indefinitely. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=73.0s)]
*  Government agencies across the board are functioning worse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=75.0s)]
*  If you talk to people in the government [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=78.0s)]
*  and you read the reporting, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=80.0s)]
*  they are functioning worse than they were before. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=81.0s)]
*  There are also enormous, almost sort of unspeakably large ramifications [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=84.0s)]
*  for people in the global south, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=90.0s)]
*  where the Musk-led cuts to foreign aid [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=92.0s)]
*  will lead to incomprehensibly needless suffering. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=95.0s)]
*  I mean, people will most definitely die [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=99.0s)]
*  as a result of cuts to AIDS relief program PEPFAR. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=104.0s)]
*  In fact, Musk's fellow billionaire Bill Gates warns that cuts to USAID [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=108.0s)]
*  could cost millions of lives throughout the world [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=113.0s)]
*  after Musk bragged about putting the agency through the wood chipper. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=117.0s)]
*  So Musk did enormous substantive damage, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=122.0s)]
*  both to our own country, to other people, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=126.0s)]
*  some of the most vulnerable abroad. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=129.0s)]
*  That's going to be hard to repair. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=131.0s)]
*  But even by his own standards, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=134.0s)]
*  because I don't think he cares about that, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=136.0s)]
*  his so-called cost-saving efficiency program, DOGE, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=138.0s)]
*  was a total failure as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=141.0s)]
*  I mean, the world's richest man promised to cut, remember, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=143.0s)]
*  federal spending by $2 trillion with a T, okay? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=146.0s)]
*  By his own website's shoddy math, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=151.0s)]
*  he managed to cut just $1.75 billion. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=154.0s)]
*  That's less than one-one-thousandth of what he promised. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=159.0s)]
*  He barely made a dent. It's a rounding error. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=163.0s)]
*  Even the Libertarian Cato Institute, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=166.0s)]
*  which is ideologically very supportive of DOGE's mission, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=168.0s)]
*  wrote that Musk, quote, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=171.0s)]
*  has over-promised and under-delivered unverifiable spending cuts. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=172.0s)]
*  It was all a con. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=176.0s)]
*  I mean, part of this is that Musk assumed, like so many people do, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=178.0s)]
*  that the government is full of lazy bureaucrats [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=182.0s)]
*  who can be fired without any meaningful consequences. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=184.0s)]
*  But even one of his own DOGE insiders had to concede it's not actually true. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=187.0s)]
*  In an interview, tech founder Sahil Lavignia, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=191.0s)]
*  who Musk placed at the VA, said, quote, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=194.0s)]
*  I would say the culture shock is mostly a lot of meetings, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=196.0s)]
*  not a lot of decisions, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=199.0s)]
*  but honestly it's kind of fine because the government works. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=200.0s)]
*  It's not as inefficient as I was expecting, to be honest. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=203.0s)]
*  I was hoping for more easy wins. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=206.0s)]
*  Adding that now that he's there, he says, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=208.0s)]
*  he finds himself surrounded by people who love their jobs, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=210.0s)]
*  who came to the government with a sense of mission driving their work. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=213.0s)]
*  Now, like most administration officials who accidentally say true things, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=217.0s)]
*  that guy got fired for that interview. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=221.0s)]
*  But Americans in general did not like the behavior and the cruelty of DOGE. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=225.0s)]
*  And now Elon Musk, with what is left of his tattered reputation, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=229.0s)]
*  is doing media interviews trying to reboot his image [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=233.0s)]
*  and distance himself from it all. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=237.0s)]
*  You know, it's not like I agree with everything the administration does. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=240.0s)]
*  So it's like, I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=245.0s)]
*  but we have differences of opinion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=250.0s)]
*  You know, there are things that I don't entirely agree with. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=253.0s)]
*  But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=258.0s)]
*  because then it creates a bone of contention. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=261.0s)]
*  So then I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=263.0s)]
*  well, I don't want to speak up against the administration, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=266.0s)]
*  but I don't want to... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=270.0s)]
*  I also don't want to take responsibility for everything the administration is doing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=274.0s)]
*  I mean, again, you've got to just concede it where it is. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=277.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy who is profoundly charismatic, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=279.0s)]
*  silver-tongued, eloquent, amazing communicator. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=282.0s)]
*  Yes, it is a tough spot to be associated with those toxic Trump policies. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=286.0s)]
*  Maybe that explains the sudden, massive unpopularity. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=289.0s)]
*  But this is you, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=293.0s)]
*  Did you feel that down into your toes, that full-body cringe? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=309.0s)]
*  Well, Musk is now leaving in disgrace [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=314.0s)]
*  because lots of people felt that way when they were around him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=317.0s)]
*  He was wholesale rejected by about everyone. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=321.0s)]
*  We've seen report after report after report [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=324.0s)]
*  that everyone simply couldn't stand the guy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=327.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter how rich he is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=330.0s)]
*  Back in March, the New York Times reported on an explosive murder [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=332.0s)]
*  Back in March, the New York Times reported on an explosive cabinet meeting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=336.0s)]
*  where Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=340.0s)]
*  and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins all tore into Musk [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=343.0s)]
*  for his haphazard cuts in their respective agencies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=346.0s)]
*  Earlier this month, the Atlantic reported on an expletive-ridden screaming match [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=349.0s)]
*  between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Pesant [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=352.0s)]
*  that spilled out from the Oval Office into more public areas of the West Wing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=355.0s)]
*  That same article also quotes the General Counsel [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=359.0s)]
*  for the American Federation of Government Employees as saying, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=362.0s)]
*  We kicked him out of town. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=365.0s)]
*  If he had stayed in the shadows and done this stuff, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=367.0s)]
*  who knows how bad it would have been, but no one likes the guy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=369.0s)]
*  No one likes the guy might be the best summation of Musk's forays [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=373.0s)]
*  into American politics I've encountered. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=378.0s)]
*  His Waterloo, sort of electorally speaking, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=381.0s)]
*  came in April, remember that, in the state of Wisconsin. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=384.0s)]
*  Remember what he did there? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=386.0s)]
*  Guy thought he was so popular, that he was such a good politician himself [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=388.0s)]
*  that he flew in from out of state and wore a cheese head [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=391.0s)]
*  and flexed his newfound political muscles in the state Supreme Court race. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=394.0s)]
*  And he spent a small fortune of his own money [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=397.0s)]
*  in support of the conservative candidate Brad Schimel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=400.0s)]
*  And it didn't work. His candidate lost by 10 points. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=403.0s)]
*  And voters, whoo, they really didn't like Musk. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=406.0s)]
*  He's just a pushy billionaire, and he's cutting everything. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=411.0s)]
*  If people need these things, he's cutting. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=417.0s)]
*  He just makes me very angry. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=419.0s)]
*  He uses money in ways that we're not used to. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=421.0s)]
*  And I really think that, you know, he should just stay out of local politics. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=427.0s)]
*  He should stay out of all politics, frankly. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=434.0s)]
*  That Wisconsin woman is not alone. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=436.0s)]
*  In fact, voters everywhere don't like him. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=438.0s)]
*  Nate Silver's polling average shows Musk's problem of approval [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=441.0s)]
*  more than 14 points underwater. That's bad. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=444.0s)]
*  About 54% of Americans saying they disapprove of the billionaire. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=446.0s)]
*  And Musk's intrusion into national politics has also had [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=450.0s)]
*  very real financial consequences for his companies. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=453.0s)]
*  I mean, he's lost billions of dollars, at least sort of on paper, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=456.0s)]
*  since he spent more than 270 million to get Trump elected last year. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=460.0s)]
*  Tesla sales, the sort of crown jewel company of his, are down huge, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=463.0s)]
*  especially in Europe, where they crashed nearly 50% year over year last month [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=469.0s)]
*  because Musk has absolutely poisoned the brand with his own toxic reputation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=473.0s)]
*  Here in the States, according to one report, quote, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=478.0s)]
*  a shopping center with a shuttered Bed Bath and Beyond store is in violation [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=480.0s)]
*  of a Detroit suburb city code for storing dozens of Tesla vehicles on its parking lot. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=484.0s)]
*  That's because there is so much inventory of these cyber trucks, they can't get rid of it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=490.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a good news for your car manufacturer when your flagship luxury trucks [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=494.0s)]
*  are just sitting unsold in a random parking lot somewhere outside of Detroit, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=498.0s)]
*  possibly drawing municipal citations. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=502.0s)]
*  In fact, Tesla shareholders are now sending the companies in crisis, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=505.0s)]
*  sending a letter to the company demanding, this is pretty funny, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=508.0s)]
*  Musk return to work full-time. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=511.0s)]
*  Huh, that's an interesting idea for the CEO. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=513.0s)]
*  Now, thankfully for them, it looks like he's going to have some more time on his hands right now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=516.0s)]
*  And so, again, in every conceivable way, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=520.0s)]
*  Musk leaves the government worse off than he found it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=523.0s)]
*  His tenure in Washington was a complete failure, substantively and politically, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=526.0s)]
*  and to his own reputation and to his own companies. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=530.0s)]
*  He got high in his own supply. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=533.0s)]
*  He convinced himself, because he's worth a lot of money, that everyone loves him, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=534.0s)]
*  that the American public would fall in love with his antics. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=539.0s)]
*  And it turns out they would really much rather he just go away. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=542.0s)]
*  Claire McCaskill is a former Democratic Senator in Missouri. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=547.0s)]
*  David French is an opinion columnist in the New York Times, and they join me now. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=550.0s)]
*  Claire, I think, what do you think that the sort of obituary on his tenure [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=554.0s)]
*  in the government is going to read? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=561.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think you ran through it all pretty and covered the territory pretty well. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=566.0s)]
*  Unlikable, full of himself, immature, arrogant, wildly rich beyond most people's imagination. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=573.0s)]
*  But at the core of it, Chris, I think he didn't really understand a democracy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=582.0s)]
*  You know, business leaders have an arrogance about them when it comes to government. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=589.0s)]
*  They think too often, they think, well, there are very smart people in government. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=594.0s)]
*  The people who work for government are less than, and I run a big company and I know how to do it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=599.0s)]
*  But most of them, if they had to operate within a democracy, would probably fail like Musk did. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=605.0s)]
*  He didn't understand the basics of a democracy that you don't take radical steps [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=613.0s)]
*  without the support of the people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=618.0s)]
*  And I've got a newsflash for him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=620.0s)]
*  Debts and deficit are not high on the list of issues of the American people. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=622.0s)]
*  If they were, we wouldn't have any. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=628.0s)]
*  Trump didn't campaign on them. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=630.0s)]
*  Trump didn't campaign on them. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=633.0s)]
*  I've never had people demonstrate in Missouri about debts and deficit. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=635.0s)]
*  So what he was trying to do, he did with it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=640.0s)]
*  He didn't do with the scalpel. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=644.0s)]
*  And really, honestly, if he'd done it strategically and carefully and slowed down to get bipartisan support, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=646.0s)]
*  he would have gotten more done, never two trillion. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=654.0s)]
*  But he would have gotten more done and probably not done the damage he's done to millions of people across the globe. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=657.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o&t=670.0s)]
