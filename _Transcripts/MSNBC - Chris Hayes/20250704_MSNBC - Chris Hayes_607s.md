# ‘Lipstick on a pig’: Trump, Republicans try to hide ‘terrible’ impact of megabill
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Happy Fourth of July. I hope you're enjoying it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=0.0s)]
*  We have a special two-hour, super-sized, super-patriotic show for you tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Just before you joined us in the last half hour, President Donald Trump signed the big bill in the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=10.08s)]
*  Oval Office. He calls it beautiful. The American people don't seem to agree. A bill that is so [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=15.68s)]
*  wildly unpopular, it screws many of the people who voted for Trump. And still, no one could really [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=20.56s)]
*  muster a good actual affirmative account for it. It's going to cut Medicaid as it cuts taxes for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=26.24s)]
*  the rich. It's going to cut food aid, like SNAP, while it throws billions of dollars in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=32.48s)]
*  immigration, customs, and enforcement. It's bad all around. It repeals all sorts of energy provisions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  that are key to the success we've had in building up the energy future. Because Donald Trump generally [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  does actually have pretty good instincts on how to market things. The lipstick they've slapped on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=51.76s)]
*  this pig is kind of funny. It ends up being the things that he came up with on the fly during the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=56.64s)]
*  campaign. Remember, there was that sort of period of time where he was doing the like, you get a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  tax cut, you get a tax cut. Things that are, by the way, temporary and extremely limited. For example, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  the big one that he keeps talking about is no tax on tips. And that does sound kind of populist, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=70.88s)]
*  although do we want to incentivize tips? No. But that's limited to a maximum deduction of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=75.52s)]
*  $25,000 a year, and it abruptly cuts off at the end of 2028, just before Trump's term is over. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=81.04s)]
*  It's a similar story with the no tax on overtime, which is capped at $12,500 a year. It also ends [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=89.68s)]
*  just three and a half years from now. Meanwhile, you might be asking, well, I wonder if they're all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=97.04s)]
*  temporary provisions in this bill. No, no, no, no, no, my dear. The New York Times points out the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=101.84s)]
*  bill provides its most generous tax breaks early on and reserves some of its most painful benefit [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=106.08s)]
*  cuts until after the 2026 midterm elections. For example, the Medicaid work requirements that are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=112.48s)]
*  going to kick a lot of people off Medicaid start in 2027. The cuts to Medicaid and food assistance [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=118.08s)]
*  are set to start in 2028, right as tips and overtime start getting taxed again. A lot of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=123.44s)]
*  people, as much as 20 million people could lose their health care, up to 7 million people could [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=131.04s)]
*  lose their food assistance, including 2 million children. Everywhere you look, you can see that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=135.68s)]
*  Republicans do kind of understand this is not a great bill. Regular voting Americans do too. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=141.52s)]
*  Take a look at these three polls. They're all conducted around the same time last month asking [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  people if they support or they oppose the bill. Across the board, it's really consistent, pretty [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=153.28s)]
*  much 20 to 30 points underwater. Trump is certainly where people hate this bill, which is why he [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  focuses on those small temporary provisions that are literally just slivers of the entirety of this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=163.76s)]
*  bill, right, which is trillions of dollars that sound much more populous than what the bill actually [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=170.56s)]
*  is. They're tiny percentages and very limited, and he gets this, which is why at the signing today, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  an event that would normally be all about the actual landmark legislation he's signing, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=180.88s)]
*  he basically said, look over there, making news by inviting the bomber pilots who conducted the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=185.68s)]
*  strikes on Iran rather than having the main focus be on the big bill. I should tell you, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=190.48s)]
*  it's unclear if those pilots were even able to attend due to security's concerns. There was a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  flyover by a B-2 bomber and airmen from Whiteman Air Force Base. Those families were in attendance. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  Again, all this is happening because Donald Trump and the Republican Party know that the less people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=207.76s)]
*  pay attention to the actual bill, the better it is. Fernanda Mondi is a Democratic strategist and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=211.6s)]
*  pollster, Charlie Dent's former Republican congressman of Pennsylvania. Donna Edwards [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=216.88s)]
*  serves as Democratic congresswoman of Maryland, and they join me now. Fernanda, what's your read [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=221.6s)]
*  on the politics of this moment? There's been all these pieces I've been saying about like, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=227.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's on a winning streak, and he bombed Iran, and a war did not start. I mean, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  we'll see about that. He won at the Supreme Court on these major questions and now passed his big [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=239.2s)]
*  legislation. I look at what Americans seem to be saying about all this, and they don't seem to be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=245.28s)]
*  that enthused. What do you think? Well, according to the polls, Chris, which is my trade, they're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=249.84s)]
*  certainly not enthused. Donald Trump is still underwater from a favorability perspective. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=256.16s)]
*  You just gave the numbers earlier on this big bill, which are deeply underwater, but I think [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=260.0s)]
*  you got to look at it for what it is. Donald Trump is on a massive winning streak. He promised [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=265.44s)]
*  American carnage when he took office for the first time in 2017, and that is what this bill [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=269.76s)]
*  delivers. And it really is big and beautiful if you're sitting in the Kremlin, because you're [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=275.12s)]
*  seeing the catastrophic damage that this is going to cause American citizens once the effects start [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=279.76s)]
*  to take effect in the years to come. But I think, Chris, the most disturbing thing about the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=286.4s)]
*  implications of this is it seems to be a Republican party and certainly a Trump administration that is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=291.28s)]
*  somewhat unconcerned about the unpopularity of this, because if you follow the law of politics [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=297.28s)]
*  in a democracy, public opinion is an important barometer, because you always expect there will [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=303.2s)]
*  be a backlash. And knowing going into this bill how unpopular it is, how some of these elements [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=308.0s)]
*  would devastate even the Trump base, the really tricky and troubling question I think Americans [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=314.0s)]
*  have to ask themselves is, why is this administration going so headfirst into something [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  that they know is so deeply unpopular and that targets their base? And I think a legitimate [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=324.64s)]
*  question is because there may not need to be the type of elections that we've been accustomed to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=331.12s)]
*  for 249 years when the midterms come. Charlie, my reading of the logic of a bill like this, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=336.64s)]
*  you've got these expiring tax cut provisions. The Republican party is going to want to extend a lot [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=344.32s)]
*  of those. But there was this moment that I thought was so interesting. It was about, I want to say, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=349.2s)]
*  four to six weeks back, where they're trying to make the math work, right? You've got to cut [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=353.44s)]
*  Medicaid to claw back some of that money that's the cost of the tax cuts, which you're still going [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=358.0s)]
*  to blow up the deficit. So I don't even really understand what the tipping point is, to be honest. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=362.88s)]
*  But there was some discussion about, well, maybe we can tax rich people a little more. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=368.0s)]
*  Trump said it. I think that would be fine. Steve Bannon said maybe we could do this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=371.76s)]
*  And then just like the kibosh got put on it so, so fast. And I wonder, as someone who serves [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=375.84s)]
*  as a Republican congressman, like there are so few people who pay the estate tax. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=382.56s)]
*  You could have just let that provision expire. Like, why doesn't that ever happen? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=387.6s)]
*  Well, there are a couple of things here. I often thought that a smarter strategy might have been [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=393.36s)]
*  for Republicans to do what they did in 2013 after President Obama was reelected and we had a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=397.92s)]
*  Republican House and we had to deal with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. And we ended up [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=404.48s)]
*  extending all of them, except for those earning over $400,000 and $450,000 if you're a married [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=410.08s)]
*  couple. That's what we did. The world didn't come to an end. Democrats, many Democrats supported it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=414.4s)]
*  And I thought that might be a smart strategy here, because as you just pointed out, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=422.48s)]
*  extending the 2017 tax cuts is one thing. That's the whole purpose of this exercise. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=426.88s)]
*  But if you're going to add reductions to medical assistance, to food assistance, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  programs that largely serve those on the lower end of the income scale, tax cuts tend to skew [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  higher to the people on the higher end of the income scale, you've created a toxic political mix. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  So if you would have allowed the highest income tax rates to go from 37 to 39.6 percent, you could [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=449.2s)]
*  maybe take a little bit, take an argument away from the Democrats. And you could also maybe put [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=454.88s)]
*  the carried interest loophole too. There are a couple of things they could have done a little [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=460.64s)]
*  bit more populous, but they chose not to. And I mean, Tom Colas and I think Brian Fitzpatrick [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  kind of screamed from the rooftops about the political damage that this bill is going to do [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=470.32s)]
*  to the party in the upcoming midterm. Yeah, there's something so perfect about the kind of, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  I called it lipstick on the pig in the intro, but just the sort of strange contradictions of the heart [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=483.68s)]
*  of this sort of MAGA moment, Donna, where it's like Trump does have sort of more, I think, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=488.88s)]
*  rhetorically populist instincts on this stuff. Like he kind of gets the no tax on overtime, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=494.0s)]
*  no tax on tips. Those sound good. They sound a lot better than we're going to cut taxes for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=500.08s)]
*  super rich people. And yet it's the same stuff at the core. Like I'm so struck by how this bill [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=505.84s)]
*  does what kind of big domestic policy Republican bills have been doing for most of the time I've [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=514.24s)]
*  covered politics, which is cutting taxes. They're skewed towards the top and cutting some social [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=518.88s)]
*  services or healthcare or something like that to pay for them. Yeah. I mean, I do think that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=524.4s)]
*  Republicans are counting on the fact that maybe Americans won't pay attention to what's in the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=530.88s)]
*  bill, but clearly that's not the case. And I think you could hear that when leader Hakeem [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=536.64s)]
*  Jeffries was on the floor for his Marathon One Minute, really describing in great detail what [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=542.72s)]
*  was in the bill and who would be hurt. And despite Republicans delaying some of the provisions that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=549.92s)]
*  will hurt the most, the loss of healthcare, the cuts to nutrition programs, the college cuts, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=556.8s)]
*  those things that Democrats are still going to have a lot to chew on in this bill to describe [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=567.12s)]
*  to the American people. And it's unpopular now. It will become more unpopular as we get closer [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=574.16s)]
*  to the midterms. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwgWOxZ1ngA&t=579.8399999999999s)]
