# 'Not MAGA enough': Laura Loomer's influence on Trump national security shakeup
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes after more than a hundred days of national security chaos and of course the signal scandal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael waltz is out as Donald Trump's national security adviser [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=6.96s)]
*  That's the headline although it hardly does justice to how this all unfolded today [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  It started this morning with reports that waltz and his deputy seen there Alex Wong [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Were soon to be removed from their jobs fired basically people familiar with the situation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=20.56s)]
*  Told the New York Times that this was in fact an ouster by Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  But then this afternoon Trump spun the ouster into something else [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=29.22s)]
*  Well, I think you got to put this under the heading of vintage Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=36.66s)]
*  Because a few hours ago we heard that Mike waltz the national security adviser was being shown the door [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=40.86s)]
*  But he as he went out one one door he went in another one and that was the nomination to be the UN ambassador [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=46.18s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said in a truth social posting said [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=53.5s)]
*  I'm pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike waltz to be the next United States ambassador to the United Nations in the interim [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=57.36s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=63.72s)]
*  Wait, what this was an abrupt and incredible shakeup that would leave Marco Rubio [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=70.8s)]
*  Get this simultaneously holding at least four [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=77.44s)]
*  official [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=82.12s)]
*  Full-time jobs in the government [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State acting national security adviser acting administrator of USAID [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=85.24s)]
*  which of course are trying to destroy and just to throw it on the pile acting head of the National Archives and all that came as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=90.04s)]
*  news to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=97.88s)]
*  Rubio's own spokeswoman at the State Department [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=99.6s)]
*  The president has just written on truth social that Mike waltz is going to become the new US ambassador to the United Nations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, there you know [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=111.8s)]
*  Fabulous and in addition to that he says that in the interim Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=113.8s)]
*  While continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Do you know how long? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=122.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's going to be serving in both roles. It is clear that I just heard this from you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  I think the one thing I certainly that I've learned is that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=132.64s)]
*  Things don't happen until the president says they're going to happen [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=136.68s)]
*  So the fact that that is which was that obviously truth social? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=141.48s)]
*  Yeah, so that is the miracle of modern technology and the social media. I mean fabulous the miracle of modern technology [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=145.24s)]
*  It is I guess classic Trump almost seems as if this was not a well-planned move [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=154.68s)]
*  But rather hear me out on this a face-saving measure by a president who wanted to fire his national security adviser [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=159.0s)]
*  But didn't want to be blamed for hiring the guy in the first place and make no mistake about it, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=165.56s)]
*  This is a demotion for Mike waltz. He's out of the core of the security establishment [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=170.68s)]
*  He's nominated to a still open position that is kind of second tier in a Republican administration [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=175.8s)]
*  In fairness to waltz you got to say this and tip of the cap. He did last longer than Trump's first [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=182.52s)]
*  National security adviser back in 2017 remember that guy [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=188.52s)]
*  Michael Flynn is the name [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=191.96s)]
*  He pled guilty lying the FBI about his contacts with Russia. He later got a trump pardon now Flynn [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=193.96s)]
*  Made it just 22 days and his departure foreshadowed an administration that you might recall was constantly churning through personnel [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=199.96s)]
*  So now here we are. We have our first high-profile firing by trump in this term [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=207.88s)]
*  There is an open question of why it is true [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=212.28s)]
*  That waltz was the one who took full responsibility for whoopsie accidentally adding a journalist to that signal chat where he and I were [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=215.24s)]
*  Discussing classified military operations in Yemen [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=222.92s)]
*  Even though that scandal really centered on defense secretary pete hegseth and since then there's been an avalanche of stories [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=226.28s)]
*  On hegseth's reckless incompetence his use of signal for instance to send those same war plans to another text chain that included his wife brother and others [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  War plans that came from a classified [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  source [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=244.04s)]
*  Despite trump alternating between clearly not understanding what the signal was about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=245.64s)]
*  Not understanding what the signal app is and also denigrating it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=251.16s)]
*  It's also clear that his inner circle is still using it right in front of him [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=255.24s)]
*  Here is an image of waltz just yesterday [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=259.96s)]
*  Captured by a royers photographer. You can see he is literally using signal in a cabinet meeting that was being televised [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=262.68s)]
*  Clearly visible in that photograph are chats with rubio with tulsi gabbert and with vice president jd vance [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=268.84s)]
*  You can actually read a part of vance's last message saying [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=275.4s)]
*  I have confirmation from my counterpart. It's turned off [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=279.24s)]
*  Oh interesting. Who's your counterpart? What's turned off? We don't know. Is it classified sure hope not [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=284.36s)]
*  All we know is mike waltz is out of there at nsa exile to the un, but although he's still got to get confirmed. We'll see [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=289.56s)]
*  Now it also appears that part of the story happening here is a kind of ideological purge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=296.68s)]
*  led by drum roll, please this woman [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=302.52s)]
*  Seen here chaining herself to one of the doors of twitter's headquarters in 2018 [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=305.24s)]
*  Because the platform had banned her for her consistently hateful posting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  It's the same woman who accompanied trump to a 9-eleven memorial last year, even though she's a 9-eleven truther [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=315.4s)]
*  She's been spotted several times in the past year [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=321.64s)]
*  Advising the former and now current president very closely. I mean really really close to him [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=324.58s)]
*  She's a far-right influencer named laura loomer who is famous for making [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=329.64s)]
*  sweeping statements like this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=334.52s)]
*  I truly believe that the people who engaged in the coup against donald trump and have caused [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=337.4s)]
*  You know civil unrest and chaos in our country for the last seven years [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=344.12s)]
*  Through crossfire hurricane and also through these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=348.76s)]
*  What I believe are illegal witch hunts against the president of the united states right now [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=351.88s)]
*  Unconstitutional witch hunts against donald trump. They are treasonous. They are traitors [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=355.86s)]
*  They should get the death penalty when they are jailed in the next trump administration [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  Just to be clear crossfire hurricane meaning that the folks in the fbi the justice department jailed executed under trump [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=365.0s)]
*  That's what she called for now early last month on the very same day that donald trump announced his tariffs according to unir times [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=371.0s)]
*  He also had a truly weird meeting with one in the same laura loomer in the oval office and in that meeting [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=377.96s)]
*  You got a laura loomer president of the united states and the guy running the national security apparatus [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=383.8s)]
*  For the most powerful nation on earth [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=388.38s)]
*  There you all in the oval office and in that meeting loomer the one you saw chained to the twitter door [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=390.38s)]
*  Was blasting waltz and his staff as insufficiently loyal to magga [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=395.34s)]
*  Shortly afterward trump fired six officials on the national security council [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=399.74s)]
*  Those were officials waltz had defended in that same oval office meeting apparently to no avail [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=404.3s)]
*  The next day in air force one trump was asked about that meeting with again his national security advisor [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  And the woman who changed herself to the door of twitter and how it went [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=416.06s)]
*  Laura loomer is a very good patron. She is a very strong person [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=422.3s)]
*  And I saw her yesterday for a little while. She has she makes recommendations of things and people [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=429.02s)]
*  And sometimes I listen to those recommendations [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=434.78s)]
*  They do seem to spend a lot of time together that she can make recommendations sometimes sometimes he listens to those recommendations [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=438.7s)]
*  Today, uh, we got the news that well waltz was out at nse [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=445.58s)]
*  I don't know from outside if these things are related, but here's what I do know [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  Loomer had beef with waltz and his deputy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=456.06s)]
*  Alex wong he's chinese by the way, so I don't really know who's doing the vetting if I [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  Was involved in vetting things like this would not be happening guys. So [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  So [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=469.9s)]
*  Again, I don't know why we have chinese individuals in positions of national security in the trump administration [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=471.02s)]
*  Maybe that's a question for michael waltz [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=477.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm quite sure alex wong is an american citizen [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=480.38s)]
*  Loomer seems to think that he's ethnically unacceptable in the position he had [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=484.14s)]
*  Whatever the reasons for waltz being marginalized, which is possibly that he had a quote in loomer's mind chinese deputy [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=488.94s)]
*  trump is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=495.5s)]
*  Kind of rearranging the deck chairs on a badly listing ship and trying to do it in a way that doesn't look bad for him [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  And part of that we should note involves him consolidating two of the most important roles in the federal government secretary of state and national security advisor [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  Giving them both to marco rubio child of cuban immigrants who once made his bones in the senate [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=509.58s)]
*  Standing up very proudly very rhetorically forcefully against dictators for the rule of law [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=514.14s)]
*  A guy who is now the face of trump's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=520.22s)]
*  unconstitutional [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=523.4s)]
*  rendition regime [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=524.6s)]
*  Have you been in touch with al salvador about returning abrigo garcia has a formal request from this administration been made [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=527.26s)]
*  Well, I would never tell you that and you know who else i'll never tell a judge [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  Because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president of the united states and the executive branch not some judge [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=536.86s)]
*  So in order to cover the incompetency of his administration donald trump is consolidating power even further giving two powerful positions to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=543.1s)]
*  a lone single sycophantic subordinate [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=550.06s)]
*  Garrett hake is the senior white house correspondent for mvc news and he joins me now garrot. What light can you shed on this shake up today? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I think you characterize it correctly as a demotion. It's especially true in this administration [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=560.6199999999999s)]
*  The president has lambasted the un throughout his political and his public career and in this white house more than any other [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=565.5s)]
*  Proximity to donald trump and to the white house is power mike waltz was just down the hallway from the oval office [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=572.04s)]
*  He was in every major meeting now, he's going to be exiled to new york [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=577.9s)]
*  I'd also think the fact that we know nothing about the fate of his deputy who you just mentioned alex wong kind of gives [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=581.02s)]
*  Us a way too. They were pushed up if not exactly pushed out, but they won't be here any longer [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=586.38s)]
*  This does go back to signal gate [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=592.78s)]
*  I think the big question that I still have tonight is why exactly today our reporting has been [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=594.6999999999999s)]
*  The trump's been a little bit frustrated over the kind of ongoing signal story [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=599.3399999999999s)]
*  Remember he met with the same reporters from the atlantic [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=603.1s)]
*  A week ago did something come up in that meeting? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=606.06s)]
*  I don't know but there's been kind of a thousand cuts against mike waltz [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=608.22s)]
*  I actually thought that when he survived that first laura lumer related purge [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=612.3s)]
*  He was probably going to be okay [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=616.22s)]
*  And in fact talked to a white house official yesterday who was telling me how things had finally calmed down in the national security advisor's office [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=617.34s)]
*  Doesn't seem to be the case [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=623.98s)]
*  Uh, and now marco rubio who's already at the white house a ton for a sitting secretary of state [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=625.74s)]
*  I think it's going to be here essentially every day [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=631.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the guy's got four jobs and they're not like it's not like well [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  You got a paper route in the morning and you're mowing lawns in the afternoon [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=638.46s)]
*  The other part of this though chris is that he has had some elements of the secretary of state job stripped away from him [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=641.9s)]
*  And given to other advisors trump has created all these envoy positions steve right off one of them rick grinell's one of them [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=647.34s)]
*  Where he's taken big diplomatic portions of the secretary of state's role and given them to other senior officials [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=652.94s)]
*  Marco rubio may have the time in his schedule to do this since he's not the guy, you know striking the deals with latin [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=659.02s)]
*  Or putin or not. That's a decent point garrett hick. Uh good good good to talk to you. Thank you you bet [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=665.5s)]
*  You [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ziplxHqQVo&t=688.78s)]
