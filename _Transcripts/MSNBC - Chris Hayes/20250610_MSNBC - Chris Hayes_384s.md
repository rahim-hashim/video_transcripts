# 'Dictator playbook': Schiff warns Trump using L.A. as military test run
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4)
*  Trump spent today making ludicrous and inflammatory claims. He tries to justify sending the US military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=0.0s)]
*  Into an American city against the wishes of the city's mayor and the state's governor [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  California's two senators also weighed in with a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hengset today a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=11.08s)]
*  decision to deploy active-duty military personnel within the United States should only be undertaken during the most extreme [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=16.4s)]
*  Circumstances and these are not them that this deployment was made over the objections of state authorities is all the more unjustified [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Senator Adam Schiff Democratic, California and author of that letter joins me now senator [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=30.88s)]
*  Are you clear on the legal authority whether it actually exists that's being claimed by the White House to send those [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=35.88s)]
*  700 active-duty Marines [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=42.72s)]
*  into the state of California, I [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=45.24s)]
*  Don't think the legal authority exists and it's not clear that the administration has even articulated the basis under which they're doing this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=48.08s)]
*  First they said they were lying for the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=55.76s)]
*  countermanding of the governor by calling out the National Guard on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=58.6s)]
*  Title 10 authorities which require the president to go through the governor not around the governor not over the governor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=61.56s)]
*  But also require things like rebellion which are clearly not in evidence here [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=67.72s)]
*  He has also relied sort of generically on his article to power as commander-in-chief [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=73.4s)]
*  again [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=79.24s)]
*  There are laws and the Constitution does not permit the president to call out the military [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=80.36s)]
*  Against citizens of the United States or to call out the military for law enforcement purposes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=85.96s)]
*  They keep throwing around the term insurrection because they may want to rely on the insurrection act [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  But they hope these highly charged terms like rebellion like insurrection [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=96.8s)]
*  Can put some kind of legal gloss on the lawlessness of their actions and Chris I think it all comes down to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=101.52s)]
*  Something the mayor pointed out quite rightly and that is the president betrayed the promise that he would focus on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=108.68s)]
*  Violent criminals who were here [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=116.08s)]
*  Unlawfully he hasn't done that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=118.8s)]
*  He's resorted to these [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=121.24s)]
*  indiscriminate raids of workplaces increasingly I fear outside of farms traffic stops the Home Depot grabbing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=123.64s)]
*  citizens and non-citizens alike and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Prompting protests which you would expect and because I think this playbook will repeat around the country [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=133.32s)]
*  It's important. We recognize this playbook Trump is using [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  Once there are protests and there are always going to be some violent agitators [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=143.48s)]
*  And you know violence has no place in this it ought to be condemned. It is condemned [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Anybody using violence should be arrested and prosecuted but the president wants these confrontations [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  So that he can call out the military in other cities in America as part of his would-be dictator playbook [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=160.72s)]
*  And we need to be aware what we're seeing in LA this abuse of the military. We are likely to see everywhere [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=167.8s)]
*  Do you think there's reporting about sending tactical units to a variety of cities that are run by? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=174.72s)]
*  Democratic governors that this is essentially a kind of provocation that that that they're trying to recreate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=181.32s)]
*  Conditions of you know the 2020 protests we saw in George Floyd and and to produce a kind of causes belly for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  larger crackdowns I [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  Do think this is part of what they aim to do [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=200.0s)]
*  I mean this began this administration began with the pardoning of hundreds of people who attacked police officers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  So in order to somehow reestablish their credentials as the law enforcement party [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  When they betrayed law enforcement in the president's first accent office, they want to somehow create this confrontation [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=214.54s)]
*  I think they would be delighted if we were a nationwide [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=221.42s)]
*  Confrontation where they can somehow claim they're the party of law and order when they are in fact the party of chaos and disorder [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=224.3s)]
*  But I think that's part of what they're trying to achieve [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=230.94s)]
*  we need to keep speaking out in favor of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=234.3s)]
*  peaceful protest against any kind of violence directed law enforcement, but also [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=237.9s)]
*  Against abusing the military this way we in California like in most states love our National Guard [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=243.3s)]
*  They're there for us in wind and fire and hurricane and flood. We cherish our relationship with the Guard [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=250.06s)]
*  Likewise, we have the greatest respect for the Marine Corps and we don't want to see those forces abused in this way [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=256.7s)]
*  It would only erode public trust in those important [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  institutions [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=267.1s)]
*  the president of course has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=268.18s)]
*  Broken with tradition to create this unprecedented military parade in peacetime on Saturday in Washington DC [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=270.66s)]
*  It's also his birthday. He threatened today explicitly [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=278.18s)]
*  The use of quote I quote him here very heavy force [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=282.06s)]
*  Against quote protesters the protesters of this would be met with very heavy force. What do you think of that? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=286.3s)]
*  Well, you know, this is kind of classic would-be strongman kind of talk he wants a military parade on his birthday [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=293.82s)]
*  It's going to cost us over 40 million for that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=300.94s)]
*  They're wasting over a hundred and forty million on this deployment of the National Guard when it wasn't necessary in Los Angeles [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=304.06s)]
*  this abuse of taxpayer resources this abuse of the military this use of the military to provoke a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  Confrontation that apparently the president wants because he is just relishing a fight [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=320.42s)]
*  We have to recognize it for what it is in addition to a terrible abuse of military power [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=326.54s)]
*  It is also degrading our military readiness in terms of threats around the world [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=332.86s)]
*  But also it's a distraction from the fact he hasn't done what he promised in lowering prices [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=337.38s)]
*  He hasn't done anything to improve the quality of life for people [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=342.86s)]
*  And after this, you know big brawl he had with the on Musk he's looking to change the topic [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=346.62s)]
*  Senator Adam Schiff of California. Thanks for your time tonight. Appreciate it. Thank you [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=353.38s)]
*  You [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atd_mjxZcm4&t=376.06s)]
