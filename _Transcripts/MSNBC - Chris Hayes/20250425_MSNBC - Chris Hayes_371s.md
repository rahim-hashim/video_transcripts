# 'Mindblowing': Hegseth's phone number found all over web, posing massive security risk
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4)
*  Boy, it just seems every day, sometimes more than once a day, there's a new jaw-dropping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=0.0s)]
*  story about Pete Hegseth's incompetence and recklessness at the Department of Defense. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=4.2s)]
*  So yesterday we learned that Hegseth had an unsecured internet line installed in his Pentagon [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=9.44s)]
*  office so he could continue to use the commercial messaging app Signal, leaving him vulnerable [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=14.6s)]
*  to potential hackers who might be interested in what the head of the DOD is up to. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=19.92s)]
*  Of course, we also know that Hegseth has used his personal cell phone, which I got to stress [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=23.64s)]
*  in the government is like a real no-no, to discuss sensitive information about imminent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=27.88s)]
*  military strikes, again, using Signal in multiple chains. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=32.76s)]
*  Today, New York Times reports, quote, Hegseth's personal phone number was easily accessible [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=36.16s)]
*  on the internet and public apps as recently as March, potentially exposing national security [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=41.16s)]
*  secrets to foreign adversaries. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=46.58s)]
*  Helene Cooper covers national security at the New York Times, where she was one of the reporters [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=49.32s)]
*  who broke this story, and she joins me now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=52.92s)]
*  Great reporting, Helene. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=55.36s)]
*  Hi, Chris. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=56.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=57.64s)]
*  It's true. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=58.64s)]
*  I mean, even low-level government officials, I have a friend who works for NOAA, and they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=59.64s)]
*  are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=62.64s)]
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=63.64s)]
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=64.64s)]
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=65.64s)]
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=66.64s)]
*  So, in fact, you're about to see the real truth. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=67.64s)]
*  The truth is that in fact, we're not the least ahead of the DOD. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=70.48s)]
*  You're told, like, do not do anything officials. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=75.04s)]
*  Certainly nothing classified in your personal phone, right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=78.5s)]
*  Hi, Chris. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=83.38s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=84.38s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=86.5s)]
*  I mean, even low-level government officials, I have a friend who works for NOAA, and she [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=87.5s)]
*  does not do any government business on her personal cellphone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=92.66s)]
*  probably one of the most targeted person in the people in the world when it comes to what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=97.54s)]
*  hackers or what foreign adversaries, you know, and when I say target, I don't mean target [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=104.18s)]
*  to kill, I mean target to surveil, who would be one of the people who would be the top [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  five or six in the United States when you're looking at officials that foreign adversaries [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  would want to get a hold of his communications device. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=122.18s)]
*  So the issue is not that Pete Hekseth has a personal cell phone, everybody does these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=125.66s)]
*  days now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=131.29999999999998s)]
*  The issue is that he has been, that personal cell phone is easily findable on the web and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=133.06s)]
*  he's been doing government business on it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=139.34s)]
*  He's been involved in signal chats in which he texted the flight plans of American fighter [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=142.14s)]
*  jets and when they're going to take off to strike Yemen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=147.62s)]
*  So he's clearly been engaging in government business on his personal cell phone and that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=150.68s)]
*  phone was very easy to find, that number was easy to find as late as March 27th when a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  German newspaper Der Spiegel was able to surface that phone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=163.48s)]
*  What we found out in our story now in doing this is we got a, we were able to acquire [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=167.94s)]
*  the exact phone number that was, that Pete Hekseth used in the signal chat. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=173.24s)]
*  Our researchers found the phone number on the web earlier and so we knew that this was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=179.28s)]
*  Pete Hekseth's phone, personal phone, but then what we found out this week is that that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=184.28s)]
*  same phone number belonging to Pete Hekseth was the exact phone number that he used in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=189.68s)]
*  the signal chat. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=195.24s)]
*  So there you have the causal, the actual going from point A to point B where he's actually [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  doing government business on it and that was sort of mind blowing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  Right, hard confirmed that it's that number, the number that you can find online, the number [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=206.28s)]
*  of his personal phone, the personal phone that has a signal where he's sending these [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=209.88s)]
*  messages on, you know, not in sort of the classified channels to people like his wife [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  and his brother and there's a great quote in here from Mike Casey, former director of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  National Counterintelligence is what he says, there's zero percent chance that someone hasn't [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=224.2s)]
*  tried to install Pegasus or some other spyware on his phone, Mike Casey said. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  He is one of the top five probably most targeted people in the world for espionage and just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=233.68s)]
*  in case people don't know Pegasus, I mean there exists software that can be remotely [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=237.36s)]
*  put into your phone that will essentially dump everything in that phone to an espionage [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=241.52s)]
*  agency even if you're using an encrypted app because it's grabbing directly from the phone, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=246.72s)]
*  Exactly, it's called zero click technology where you don't even have to open any, all [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=253.52s)]
*  you have to do for it to grab is you don't have to open anything, it will just see you, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=259.92s)]
*  it will see what you are writing as you are writing it, as you are texting it, so signal [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=265.36s)]
*  for instance is encrypted at the moment that you're sending and as you're receiving, you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=271.6s)]
*  know, once you send it, it's encrypted, once you receive it, it's encrypted but what you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=276.6s)]
*  can't, what there's technology that's able to do is to, it's almost as if it's got a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=280.92s)]
*  camera on your shoulder and it's looking at what you're typing so if anything like that is on that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=286.28s)]
*  cell phone then you know Pete Hexeth would have, this would be an intelligence breach and it's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=292.4s)]
*  hard to imagine if you're Iran or if you're Russia or if you're China and China has proven [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=298.44s)]
*  that they're able to do this so has Russia. China had that, there was that big salt typhoon [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  case last year, they've proven that they're able to do some of this and that they wouldn't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=312.2s)]
*  be targeting the Secretary of Defense's cell phone. Yeah and I just cannot stress enough, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=318.68s)]
*  like this stuff is day one throughout the entire security apparatus in the United States, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=324.48s)]
*  from contractors to federal workers to anyone with classification to anyone in any of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=330.8s)]
*  military services. Day one, all of this stuff, like you really can't emphasize enough how much [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=336.24s)]
*  of a breach this would be if you were low-level. It's remarkable reporting you and your colleagues [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=343.0s)]
*  have put together. Helene Cooper at the New York Times. Thank you so much, appreciate it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGamz7DpEb4&t=347.56s)]
