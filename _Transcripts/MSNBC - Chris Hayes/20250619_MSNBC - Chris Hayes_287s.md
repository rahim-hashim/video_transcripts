# ‘Papers, please’: Hayes flags new police tactic trend in Trump’s America
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM)
*  One of the cherished parts of being an American is freedom of movement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=0.0s)]
*  When you walk around, and this obviously applies more to certain folks than others, but you [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  usually don't have to stop at internal checkpoints or to show your papers to police. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=9.0s)]
*  I've traveled in other countries where, say, your bus stops and heavily armed federal agents [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  climb on board to check everyone's papers. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=19.16s)]
*  It doesn't feel good. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  It feels like a quintessential fixture of a country that's not fully free. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=23.2s)]
*  And it's happening more and more and more in Trump's America. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=28.36s)]
*  What's up, guys? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=32.32s)]
*  Can I see your ID, please? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=33.8s)]
*  23-year-old Elzon Lemus, an electrician, was in his work van with a co-worker when they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=35.92s)]
*  were pulled over by ICE agents in Westbury. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=41.32s)]
*  Because you look like somebody I'm looking for. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=43.8s)]
*  What are you looking for? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Lemus asks why they need his ID. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  All right, this is going to go one of two ways here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=49.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=51.92s)]
*  I need to see your ID. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=52.92s)]
*  If you're not the guy I'm looking for, you're not the guy I'm looking for. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=53.92s)]
*  Do you have your ID? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=57.08s)]
*  But we need your ID. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=59.72s)]
*  Nah, I don't need it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=62.24s)]
*  Okay, if we don't get your ID, then we're going to have to figure out another way to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=63.24s)]
*  ID you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=65.84s)]
*  And that may not work out well for you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=66.84s)]
*  Nah, listen, I'm not rolling up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=68.84s)]
*  I can't be down for all this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=70.84s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=72.84s)]
*  The agent forces the door open and demands Lemus stops recording. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=73.84s)]
*  Lemus was born and raised in New York and was stunned. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=78.4s)]
*  I felt like my rights were just out the window. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=81.4s)]
*  So those agents pulled that 23-year-old from the van. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  They handcuffed him, later released him after confirming, whoopsies, he's an American. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=89.0s)]
*  No apologies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=93.64s)]
*  And he's not alone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  Brian Gavidia, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, was working on a car in a tow [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=96.48s)]
*  yard last week. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=100.84s)]
*  When he stepped outside, he was thrown into a metal fence by federal agents who asked [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=102.2s)]
*  him where he was born. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=107.48s)]
*  You're twisting this ****, I'm American, bro. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=108.48s)]
*  You guys are literally based off a skin color. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=112.2s)]
*  I got a new ID with me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=116.2s)]
*  My homie was born here just because of the way he looks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=118.2s)]
*  Again, you're working, you're outside, armed mass federal agents come up and say, show [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=126.2s)]
*  me your papers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=131.08s)]
*  Push you up against the fence. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=132.8s)]
*  He was not arrested, but he told the LA Times that those agents took his real ID and never [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=133.8s)]
*  returned it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the proof that he's an American. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=139.96s)]
*  It was the worst experience I've ever felt, he said. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=142.0s)]
*  I felt honestly like I was going to die. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=144.0s)]
*  These are the cruel absurdities people are now facing every day. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=148.0s)]
*  Like this car full of members of an Arizona-based Native American tribe who were followed for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=151.0s)]
*  miles and then pulled over by border patrol last week. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=156.24s)]
*  Everybody in here, you a citizen? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=160.24s)]
*  We're the first ones. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=163.24s)]
*  We're Native American, we're the first ones. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=165.24s)]
*  All perfect. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=168.24s)]
*  Perfect, huh? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=171.24s)]
*  What are you? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=172.24s)]
*  What are you? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=173.24s)]
*  Are you an American citizen? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=174.24s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=176.24s)]
*  You're not a first born, you're not from this land, and neither are you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=178.24s)]
*  This is the America that Donald Trump and Stephen Miller want, the what they're trying [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=183.24s)]
*  to create. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=186.4s)]
*  It's what we saw unfold at Dodger Stadium earlier today and at Home Depot in Hollywood, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=187.4s)]
*  just as we saw it on the other side of LA over the weekend. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=192.24s)]
*  They're going to end up in a flea market that was effectively shut down by ICE and border [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=195.24s)]
*  patrol agents armed with M-16s wearing masks, full military body armor. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=200.24s)]
*  They look like they're going to go kill Osama bin Laden. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=205.24s)]
*  Agents who went up to bystanders at a flea market and asked them, where are you from? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=209.24s)]
*  Got to show your papers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=215.24s)]
*  Americans are being forced to accept mass paramilitary forces, stopping people anytime, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=217.24s)]
*  anywhere, in any circumstance, demanding to know where people are from. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=223.24s)]
*  The way Trump sold this in the campaign was by saying, we're going to go at these other [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=229.24s)]
*  people that you hate, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=235.24s)]
*  There's this other group and they're bad and they're hurting our country, and I'm going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=237.24s)]
*  to protect you American citizens. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=241.24s)]
*  We're seeing every day, there is no way to do this, what they want to do, mass deportation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=243.24s)]
*  that is not massively disruptive to the liberties of every American. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=250.24s)]
*  In fact, it's an assault on the idea of America itself. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=255.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZbZnfMcmM&t=280.24s)]
