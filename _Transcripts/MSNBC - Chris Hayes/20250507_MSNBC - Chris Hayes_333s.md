# Crockett: GOP ‘running late and running scared’ over Trump budget bill
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0)
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett's a Democrat of Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=0.0s)]
*  She serves as a vice ranking member of the Oversight [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  Committee and also serves on the Doge subcommittee, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=4.42s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  I want to start with a question to you from your perch, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=7.86s)]
*  and particularly the Doge subcommittee. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=10.58s)]
*  If my read on this, which is they kind of like this weird [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=12.26s)]
*  division of labor where Elon Musk just cuts a bunch of stuff [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  and they get to be like, I don't know, take it up with him, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=19.86s)]
*  because then they don't have to vote for anything [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=22.42s)]
*  and they get a lot of cuts they want. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  And now that's coming to an end. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=26.68s)]
*  Yeah, listen, it's interesting because the Doge subcommittee [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=32.4s)]
*  is all for cosplay, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=37.2s)]
*  Like we had a hearing today and it was all about trans people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  fencing, and they brought in someone. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=42.84s)]
*  They actually subpoenaed a man and was like, hey, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=46.2s)]
*  we know we give you zero federal dollars, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=49.32s)]
*  but we want to talk about this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, so this is efficient of us [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=53.08s)]
*  to do this, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=56.0s)]
*  But they did not want to have a conversation around the cuts, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=57.46s)]
*  cuts that you just were having a conversation about, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=60.78s)]
*  One of the things that I decided to do, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=64.18s)]
*  they may not have wanted to talk about it, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=65.9s)]
*  but I was going to highlight it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=67.64s)]
*  And what I did is I went through each and every one [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=69.26s)]
*  of the members on the Doge subcommittee. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=71.98s)]
*  I went through their districts and talked about how many [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=74.22s)]
*  children specifically were at risk for losing their Medicaid. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=76.68s)]
*  And guess whose district was at the top of the list? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=80.5s)]
*  The chairwoman with 111,000 children [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=82.94s)]
*  that stands the risk of losing their Medicaid, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=86.98s)]
*  yet we're having a conversation or we're sitting out [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=90.5s)]
*  and giving red meat to Fox News instead of talking [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=94.42s)]
*  about the real issues. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=97.58s)]
*  Am I right that the train is running late right now [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=99.3s)]
*  in terms of the timing of all this? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=102.22s)]
*  I mean, I was trying to go back and look at where things were, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=104.38s)]
*  but the Ron Johnson quote was interesting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=106.86s)]
*  Again, a lot of this has been behind the closed doors. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=108.5s)]
*  Trump does so much by like fiat and decree, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=111.34s)]
*  even though he constitutionally can't, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=114.06s)]
*  that this has been obscured. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  In a different administration, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=117.06s)]
*  there'd be more eyeballs on this, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  but it does seem like they're running late. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=120.94s)]
*  Is that your sense? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=122.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're running late [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=126.54s)]
*  and they're running scared. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=127.9s)]
*  Listen, you either are going to do what you need to do [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=128.94s)]
*  as it relates to the people that elected you, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  or you are going to go ahead and make sure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=133.96s)]
*  that you bend the knee to your king. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=136.22s)]
*  And right now they don't know which one to do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=139.24s)]
*  I don't even know why it's a debate, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=142.3s)]
*  but that's where we are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=143.74s)]
*  Like this week, we were actually supposed to have markups [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=145.06s)]
*  in two of the most important committees. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=148.02s)]
*  We were supposed to have a markup in energy and commerce. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  That is where the Medicaid cuts are supposed to come in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  to the tune of $880 billion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  They also were supposed to have a markup [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=157.78s)]
*  as it relates to agriculture and SNAP benefits, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=160.22000000000003s)]
*  cutting $220 billion from SNAP [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=162.86s)]
*  when people only get $6 a day to eat in SNAP benefits [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=165.9s)]
*  for those that do receive it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=169.02s)]
*  And the last time I checked, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=170.38s)]
*  you probably can't get 12 eggs for that amount of money. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=171.58s)]
*  And so instead of doing it, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=174.5s)]
*  literally there was a leak in a story that came out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=176.38s)]
*  where staffers said, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=179.1s)]
*  no, we want to make sure we can flood the zone. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=180.5s)]
*  So whenever we do this, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=182.58s)]
*  we're going to make sure that these committees [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  are going to be at the same time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=185.38s)]
*  Like the fact that you're hiding from your constituents, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  the fact that you literally just are like, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=190.3s)]
*  let me just throw everything at you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=192.3s)]
*  so that we can overwhelm you, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  instead of actually doing your job, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=195.7s)]
*  I cannot wait until voters have an opportunity to say, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=198.26s)]
*  you took food out of my mouth, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=202.26s)]
*  you took a roof from over my head, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=204.06s)]
*  you're responsible for making sure [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=206.1s)]
*  that I do not have healthcare, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=207.86s)]
*  I'm going to make sure you don't have a job. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=209.98s)]
*  Do you think the balance of power in that caucus [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=212.98s)]
*  has shifted at all? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=217.86s)]
*  I mean, you have people that are in vulnerable districts, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=218.78s)]
*  there's just reporting that they had, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=221.94s)]
*  one of the ideas they flooded [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=223.54s)]
*  was cutting the federal contribution to Medicaid, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=224.64s)]
*  the folks facing voters in swingish districts [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=227.38s)]
*  got worried about that, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=230.98s)]
*  Johnson told the House Republicans [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=231.9s)]
*  they were cutting that idea out, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=233.7s)]
*  you've heard the reporting about the other cuts [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=235.3s)]
*  they're considering, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=237.06s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=238.26s)]
*  what is your sense of who gets steamrolled here, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=240.02s)]
*  Because there's sort of two factions [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=242.74s)]
*  that can't both have their way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=244.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's those in vulnerable districts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=249.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=252.02s)]
*  I think they're the ones that are going to get steamrolled. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=252.84s)]
*  I mean, when we look at what happened in New York, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=254.66s)]
*  all of those that were in vulnerable districts, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  for the most part, four out of five of them, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=258.9s)]
*  they ended up losing their seats. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=261.14s)]
*  So I think it's going to be those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  that potentially keep them actually in the majority, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=265.06s)]
*  those are the ones that are going to lose out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=268.74s)]
*  So the Don Bakens in Nebraska, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=270.26s)]
*  who's desperately fighting for his life, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  we know that Biden won that district, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=274.76s)]
*  we know that Harris won that district, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=276.14s)]
*  and unfortunately, our candidate did not overcome Don Bakens, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  so you've seen him speaking out, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  and I think what they'll try to do [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  is they'll try to have kind of this, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=286.06s)]
*  oh, I'm speaking out, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=288.46s)]
*  and they're hoping that people only see them talking [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=290.54s)]
*  and don't see what they're doing, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=294.54s)]
*  and I just hope that we do everything that we can [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=296.66s)]
*  to make sure that those constituents know [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=299.1s)]
*  that they are the reason that you are hurting right now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=301.3s)]
*  Mike Lawler, another one in New York, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=304.3s)]
*  who was the fifth out of those four or five, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  the one who survived, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=308.46s)]
*  he's going to have some tough votes coming up too, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=309.58s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmy Crockett, thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=311.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgHXm6tbww0&t=316.06s)]
