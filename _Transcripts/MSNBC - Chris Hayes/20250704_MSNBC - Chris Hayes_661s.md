# 'Overwhelming enthusiasm': Inside Zohran Mamdani’s stunning victory
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k)
*  In the days since it became clear that Zoran Mamdani would be the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City, the response from Republicans has been about as unhinged as you might expect. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is practically frothing at the mouth, threatening to arrest Mamdani, who of course has not broken any laws. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=11.0s)]
*  There's talk on the right that they're going to like denaturalize him and deport him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=17.0s)]
*  At least one Republican congressman has called for the 33-year-old state assemblyman, a naturalized U.S. citizen, to be deported. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=21.0s)]
*  And it hasn't just been that. Even some established Democrats have refused to back their party's choice or said really vile things about him, despite the overwhelming enthusiasm for his candidacy here in New York. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=28.0s)]
*  But if there's one thing Mamdani has demonstrated over the course of this campaign so far, is he's pretty good at just kind of sticking to his principles and message discipline. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=39.0s)]
*  He doesn't bow down in the face of pressure, but then he keeps pivoting back to the center of what he campaigned on, which is affordability. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=47.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what a lot of Democrats, again, across the ideological spectrum, have been both talking about and are looking for right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=55.0s)]
*  Lydia Polgrain had a good piece in the New York Times this week, writing, quote, Mamdani's one is a rebuke of the strategy such as it is that many leading Democrats have advocated in the face of Trump's shock and awe attempt to remake the presidency in the country in his dark image. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=62.0s)]
*  Happily veering between not getting distracted by Trump's lawless actions and signaling their moderation in the face of Trumpian antics as their base marches in the streets, Democrats are missing the core political reality of our time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=76.0s)]
*  Emma Vigeland co-hosts the Majority Report with my buddy Sam Seder. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=89.0s)]
*  Fash Shakir is a senior advisor to Senator Bernie Sanders and the executive director of More Perfect Union. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=93.0s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=99.0s)]
*  Emma, I want to start with the response to Mamdani and what you make of it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=101.0s)]
*  In some ways, he's sort of created in a lab to make Republican and conservative politicians absolutely lose their mind and they have not disappointed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=107.0s)]
*  But there's also been broadly a lot of pretty insane reactions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=117.0s)]
*  I think you're absolutely right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=122.0s)]
*  I mean, just think about this for a second. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=125.0s)]
*  The fact that so many people see Zoran Mamdani, a man who is born in Uganda and of Indian heritage, and they immediately go to anti-Semitism or Hamas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=127.0s)]
*  What else can you call that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=140.0s)]
*  And as you just said, Chris, this is not just Republicans. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=142.0s)]
*  Republicans, of course, we expect that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=145.0s)]
*  So many of the arguments that I'm hearing against Mamdani now, I feel like I could have heard them against Obama in 2008 when he won the nomination. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=147.0s)]
*  Where it's just this constant stream of racist attacks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=154.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, though, we saw from politicians like Kirsten Gillibrand and others some really unfortunate Islamophobic racism directed at Mamdani. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=158.0s)]
*  And it's just incredible to me to see how despite the fact that Democratic voters now CNN showed this the other day that they sympathize with Palestinians by more than 43 points at this point. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=169.0s)]
*  That you still see this reflexive reaction because of his faith from members of the party here trying to shut him down and trying to negate his message, especially when Democrats are talking about, oh, gosh, we have to bring young people and young men back into the fold. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=183.0s)]
*  The youth vote in this race was absolutely overwhelming. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=203.0s)]
*  Pulses, I think, estimated prior to the race that 18 to 44 year olds would be around 30% of the electorate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=208.0s)]
*  They were nearly half. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=215.0s)]
*  So if we want to bring young people back into the fold, this tactic of trying to silence him or not endorse him, it's the absolute wrong way to go. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really good point. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=225.0s)]
*  I mean, I should I want to be clear here about the sort of there's sort of two things going on with him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=227.0s)]
*  I mean, there's this really Islamophobic and disgusting sort of racist attacks as othering his politics on. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=231.0s)]
*  The question of Israel and Palestine, he co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=237.0s)]
*  He was an advocate for boycott, divestment, sanctions like his politics on that are politics that a lot of people in the Democratic Party do not share and oppose on the merits. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=241.0s)]
*  I just want to make the distinction like some people just don't like what he says about the issue because they have different views. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=250.0s)]
*  One of the things that you end up having to do Fazz in Democratic coalition politics, which I think is one of the things I think he's done very well is that's kind of what happens in coalition politics. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=256.0s)]
*  Like you are going to have views that people don't like and you're going to have to figure out how to talk to people about it, not just sort of like abandon those views and double back because that looks totally inauthentic, but also focus on the things where you do have the kind of maximal amount of power and consensus. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=266.0s)]
*  And I think my criticism of the current modern Democratic Party is it's lacking in grassroots-ism. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=286.0s)]
*  And here comes Zoran building from a grassroots coalition a constituency of people who care deeply about not only this issue, a whole set of issues around affordability. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=292.0s)]
*  And I would hope that more Democrats would heed it and say, hey, maybe there's something to learn from this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=303.0s)]
*  Maybe even on a whole set of issues, is there something that we could sit down and talk to him about and gather his inputs on rather than to stiff arm him and push this entire coalition away, which of course is why a lot of the coalition that Zoran has won has felt pushed out of the Democratic Party. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=308.0s)]
*  He brought people back in who had been not voting in 2024. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=323.0s)]
*  So it's frustrating, but this is part of a billionaire agenda. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=328.0s)]
*  To be clear, you have Bill Ackman, you got Barry Diller, you got a whole bunch of people, Mayor Bloomberg, who all are dumping money in. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=331.0s)]
*  And so you'll see these smear attacks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=337.0s)]
*  You'll see them from Trump because they want Eric Adams. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=339.0s)]
*  They want an indicted mayor of New York City to return. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=342.0s)]
*  And so you're going to have distraction, the politics of distraction for sure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, but there's something he does that I think reminds me of what Bernie Sanders I think has done quite effectively. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=348.0s)]
*  I mean, I should note Waleed Shaheed published this great analysis we've had on the show of mainstream media coverage of Mamdani, which has been overwhelmingly about Israel and Palestine and Gaza, even though that was not at all the focus of his campaign at all. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=355.0s)]
*  And in fact, he would get asked it by the media, but he was always talking about affordability, affordability, affordability. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=369.0s)]
*  And Emma, one of the things I think he does well that reminds me of Sanders is he gets this Venn diagram of stuff that he believes in, that progressive policy and that sound good to a lot of people, a rent freeze. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=376.0s)]
*  And he'll talk about other stuff and he doesn't run away from his values on this stuff. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=390.0s)]
*  But like Bernie Sanders, who I have interviewed literally hundreds of times, he will turn you back to those talking points about the stuff he wants to focus on over and over and over again where he feels most confident he's got the biggest audience. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=395.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=411.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And Fass knows this, you know, working for the OG Sanders here. But like this is how you beat billionaires and you combat a campaign finance system that is immensely corrupt. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=412.0s)]
*  Now in New York City, we have matching funds and that's a huge, I think, model for the rest of the country as to how to combat this influx of corporate money that is now completely dominating the Republican Party. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=425.0s)]
*  But you have, as Fass just said, Bill Ackman, DoorDash, like Bloomberg, all just pouring in endless money into the Fix the City Super PAC because basically Citizens United since 2010 said we're going to merge corporate personhood and we're going to make it so that corporations can have unabridged speech because speech equals money, like Buckley v. Valeo said. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=436.0s)]
*  And this has created this toxic storm that has brought us to this moment of oligarchy. And it's just incredible to me that you can have Andrew Cuomo, who has like the litany of just absolute scandals behind him, but who also on this issue of Israel-Palestine recently volunteered his services for Benjamin Netanyahu as his lawyer on ICC war crimes charges. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=459.0s)]
*  This is true. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=484.0s)]
*  This is true. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=485.0s)]
*  In late 2024, when Israel had already been accused of committing genocide by countless credible scholars and by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=486.0s)]
*  So you have a guy who is lapping up Trump donor money, billionaire money, and offering to defend a man who is slaughtering hundreds of innocent people a day. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=495.0s)]
*  Democrats are flummoxed that primary voters weren't into this kind of thing specifically because I do think there is another racism here that's or bigotry that's not being talked about, which is the assumption that Jewish voters are going to just be led by this one particular issue. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=504.0s)]
*  New York City has one of the largest Jewish populations in the world. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=519.0s)]
*  And I found a lot of the rhetoric about what they thought what a lot of national pundits thought Jewish voters would do in this race to be pretty anti-Semitic. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=522.0s)]
*  Turns out Jewish New Yorkers are like all everybody else. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=532.0s)]
*  We're voting and it's the economy, stupid as Carvel would say. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=535.0s)]
*  Right. These are kitchen table issues. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=540.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the thing about when you get to the number there's a million Jewish folks in New York City, roughly. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=543.0s)]
*  It's a city of eight million people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=549.0s)]
*  It's the thing, Faz, that like you always have to come back to with every group. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=551.0s)]
*  And this is a thing that we all fall prey to, I think, in political analysis. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=554.0s)]
*  Like when you're talking about a million of anyone, of anyone, like people got a lot of different views inside that million. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=559.0s)]
*  Like that's a lot of people. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=567.0s)]
*  And there's a there's a kind of short cutting that ends up happening a lot, particularly in Democratic politics, because it's such a diverse coalition. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=568.0s)]
*  And to try to address the coalition politics you were talking about earlier, to bring people together on a common set of agenda. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=575.0s)]
*  This is why Bernie Sanders and myself go back to the things that we know that huge amounts of Jewish Americans, Muslim Americans, Asian Americans, you name them, are going to feel, hey, can I talk to you about the issues around busing? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=581.0s)]
*  Can I talk to you around the issues of housing? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=593.0s)]
*  Can I talk to you about the issues of childcare? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=595.0s)]
*  How much will that resonate with you? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=596.0s)]
*  They'll start to hear. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=598.0s)]
*  And we are frogs boiling in water in the sense of the politics all around us has become this kind of sense of elitism driven politics here in the Senate. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=599.0s)]
*  Not only do you have this kind of bill that you've been talking about all day and you got crypto. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=606.0s)]
*  How do these things get moved to the top of the agenda? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=610.0s)]
*  But in here you have if you were to describe the AOC politics, the Bernie politics, the Momdani politics, as to say you're on behalf of people. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=612.0s)]
*  What would it look like if you said, hey, you know, the number one agenda item is we're going to talk about. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=619.0s)]
*  Housing costs. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=624.0s)]
*  It's just it's so many people. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=625.0s)]
*  It's like crazy that you it's not on the agenda anywhere. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=627.0s)]
*  Why? Because we don't have a working class politics that drives the agenda. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=630.0s)]
*  People know that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=634.0s)]
*  You [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6fnODmQ2k&t=654.0s)]
