# ‘Pathetic’: Mayor Bass reacts to DHS official saying her arrest is ‘on the table’
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ)
*  So what I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  occupation, and I have to tell you spending many years traveling into [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=5.72s)]
*  conflict areas, you know, it's the way the city, it's the way a city looks before [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=9.18s)]
*  a coup. That's how Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described this scene yesterday at [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=15.06s)]
*  MacArthur Park, the heart of a largely immigrant neighborhood. Federal [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=21.64s)]
*  immigration agents heavily armed in a military gear descended in armored [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=26.2s)]
*  vehicles and on horseback to conduct a sweep while a military style helicopter [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  circled overhead. It was a truly bizarre scene. Journalist Ken [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=34.84s)]
*  Clippenstein reports of the whole operation was intended as a quote show [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=40.0s)]
*  of presence, according to internal army documents he obtained, which have not [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=43.96s)]
*  been independently verified by NBC News. Mayor Bass rushed to the scene Monday [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=47.84s)]
*  morning telling agents to leave the park quote right now and joining me now is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=52.48s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. She previously represented the Los Angeles [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=56.8s)]
*  area as a Democratic congresswoman for 11 years. Mayor Bass, it's great to have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  you on first. I guess I want to find out from you how you knew about what was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=64.0s)]
*  happening there and if the federal government communicated you formally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=68.24s)]
*  through any channels in any way. No, there is no formal communication and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=71.8s)]
*  basically it's because the immigrant rights institutions in our city are [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=78.0s)]
*  very well organized. They have a rapid response network and I get my news from [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=82.84s)]
*  them. So I was sitting in a room and everybody's phone started blowing up [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=89.04s)]
*  and that told me that the military had arrived in a park, a park where nothing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=93.68s)]
*  was happening, Chris, and to see the soldiers march through, they literally [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=99.6s)]
*  marched through the kids summer camp. The kids had to be ushered in a building [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=104.48s)]
*  so that they weren't exposed to the scene. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  There were so there's a summer camp happening in the park. Now, did you do [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=113.84s)]
*  you can do you know that it was actual military is something that's been a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=116.84s)]
*  little unclear in the reporting federal agents in Camo or actually members of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=119.68s)]
*  the Marines or National Guard that have been mobilized by the Trump [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=123.72s)]
*  administration. Do you know that for a fact? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=127.44s)]
*  No, and let me just tell you that that is one of the mysteries of what is going [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=129.6s)]
*  on in our town. What I do know is that the custom Border Patrol was definitely [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=134.36s)]
*  there. I have been told that the National Guards and the Marines were playing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=138.88s)]
*  different roles, some on the periphery, but that we don't know that for sure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=143.68s)]
*  That is the problem. We have a lot of people who are not in uniform at all [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=148.2s)]
*  wearing street clothes with vests, but the vests sometimes say nothing more [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=152.76s)]
*  than police or it says nothing at all. Jumping out of unmarked cars with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  tinted windows, no license plate, wielding guns, pulling people off the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=163.32s)]
*  street. That is the scene in L. A. Right now. And it's shameful because there [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=168.68s)]
*  isn't that we didn't. We were not having problems before the first raid, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=174.16s)]
*  which was June six. The administration has brought deliberately chaos in a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=178.2s)]
*  situation, chaos and fear because people around the city now are afraid to go [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=184.24s)]
*  to work. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  I want to. There's been a lot of invective hurled at you by federal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=191.8s)]
*  spokespeople from the administration. I want to just give you a chance to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=196.36s)]
*  respond to a few things. So one of them was the spokesperson DHS had this to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  say about the possibility of arresting you. Not sure for what, but here's what [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  she had to say. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  When you have scenes like you did out in L. A. Today, where you have the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  mayor, Karen Bass, interfering with official federal officer proceedings, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  trying to enforce the laws that are put on the books by members of duly [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  elected members of Congress. Are you all hesitant to just go out and arrest her? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=226.12s)]
*  Or has it has all of this behavior not reached that threshold yet? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=231.72s)]
*  We're certainly keeping everything on the table. Charlie, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  your reaction that mayor? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=242.0s)]
*  Well, they're, you know, they're going to arrest me for doing my job. I mean, as [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  mayor, my number one responsibility is to keep Angelino safe. Now, it never [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=250.08s)]
*  dawned on me that I would have to worry about keeping Angelino safe from my own [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  government, from military that are supposed to be overseas fighting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=259.48s)]
*  foreign enemies from the Custom and Border Patrol. We're about two and a half [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=264.48s)]
*  hours away from a border or from the National Guard that have been [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=269.0s)]
*  federalized unnecessarily. You know, this is an example of the federal [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=273.68s)]
*  government essentially seizing power from a governor, federalizing the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=278.16s)]
*  National Guard's bringing them to Los Angeles when nobody asked for them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  These air young women and men that have pulled been pulled out of work. They've [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=287.8s)]
*  been pulled from their families. They've been pulled from school for an [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=291.56s)]
*  assignment that is basically I mean, I don't know what this is other than a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=295.52s)]
*  political stunt. I do feel like L. A. Is a Petri dish and we are the experiment [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  and basically sending the signal to the nation that this is what's coming your [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  way. First L. A. Let's see who's next. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=308.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to when you talk about the sort of federal power grab here, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=313.12s)]
*  this is what the Customs Border Patrol sector chief had to say, basically [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=318.44s)]
*  telling you that, you know, not quite. It's my city now, but but but sort of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=323.12s)]
*  that idea. Take a listen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=327.88s)]
*  The federal government is not leaving L. A. I don't work for Karen Bass. The [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=331.84s)]
*  federal government doesn't work for Karen Bass. We're gonna be here till [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  that mission is accomplished, as I said, and better get used to us now because [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=339.08s)]
*  this is gonna be normal very soon. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  What do you say that? I mean, I just I just have to say that I think that it's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  pathetic. I mean, last I checked all of us work for the American people. And so [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=352.68s)]
*  as I said, I am the duly elected official here to represent the city, and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=358.2s)]
*  it is my job to protect the city. I was not interfering. It is my [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  responsibility to ask what are you doing here in this park where nothing is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=367.76s)]
*  going on? Why are you grabbing people off the street, making a lot of people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  believe that kidnappings are taking place? You know, we have whole sectors [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=378.84s)]
*  of the city now and the economy that has come to a halt. Our fashion district, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=383.2s)]
*  4000 independent businesses is a ghost town. We have restaurants and other [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=388.2s)]
*  places of work where the workforce is afraid to come in. Having restaurant [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=393.24s)]
*  owners tell me that this is worse than Covid. So this is damaging to our [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=397.68s)]
*  economy. It's damaging, especially to the Children. And this is all about a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=402.8s)]
*  political stunt. And I think it's really sad to disrupt people's lives. We don't [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=408.56s)]
*  know where people are taken. We don't know if they're in the state. They have [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=412.44s)]
*  no contact with their families, no contact with lawyers. They're held in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  inhumane conditions. They're held in mass cells with 300 people in them, and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=419.88s)]
*  that are designed for, you know, maybe 30 or so multiple beds in the detention [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=425.52s)]
*  center where they're only supposed to be held for a day or less, and they've [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=431.6s)]
*  been held there for many days and in some cases weeks. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=436.04s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. I really appreciate you taking time to speak to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  us tonight. Thank you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=445.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAfxumXnXQ&t=447.20000000000005s)]
