# ‘Not even remotely normal’: New concern over Trump’s rambling speeches, posts
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE)
*  If we're going to have a conversation about the mental acuity of a recent president, it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=0.0s)]
*  does seem a little weird to be focusing exclusively on the last one, and also include the one [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=4.7s)]
*  who blasted out this typically truly insane all-cap social media screen yesterday, Happy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=11.38s)]
*  Memorial Day to all, okay, weird way to start, including the scum that spent the last four [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=16.82s)]
*  years trying to destroy our country through warped radical left minds who allowed 20 million [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=22.3s)]
*  people to illegally enter our country, many of them being criminals and the mentally insane [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=27.62s)]
*  through an open border policy that only an incompetent president would approve and on [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=31.18s)]
*  and on and on like an old man ranting at the sky. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=35.46s)]
*  Alexi McCammon is host of the podcast In Sync with Alexi Feshekir, the senior advisor, Senator [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=38.74s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, executive director of the progressive nonprofit news organization More [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=43.46s)]
*  Perfect Union. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=47.3s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=48.3s)]
*  You know, one of the things, Alexi, that I think is sort of struggle, and it is a news [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=49.3s)]
*  room saying that we don't cover the planes that land, that when things are normal, they're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=55.58s)]
*  not news, when they're abnormal, they become news. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=63.14s)]
*  And again, Trump's sort of stream of consciousness, these addresses over the weekend, which would [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=67.14s)]
*  have been like obviously massive, enormous news cycles if they had been delivered by [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=71.74s)]
*  another politician, including Joe Biden, are so absorbed and priced in now that to see [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=76.68s)]
*  what's in front of your face, is itself difficult? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=82.58s)]
*  Yeah, it was news when he wished Joe Biden well after he was diagnosed with prostate [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=85.9s)]
*  cancer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=91.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=92.7s)]
*  That was like, oh, my God, this is amazing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=93.7s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=94.7s)]
*  And to your point, it's like we're normalizing these crazy screeds, which is, of course, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=95.7s)]
*  just lowering the bar for Republican leadership, not Democratic leadership, lowering the bar [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=100.22s)]
*  for Republican leadership for the forever future, as far as I can tell. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  And it's a disgrace when Democrats included say, well, we should thank President Trump [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=109.62s)]
*  for being nice and normal and choosing Biden over cancer. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=113.58s)]
*  I mean, he's calling him scum a few days later. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=117.30000000000001s)]
*  So it's a problem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  You know, part of it, too, has to do with this question about, you know, one of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  sort of questions in the political discourse after this this book on the on the last few [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=125.06s)]
*  years of the Biden administration or the Biden administration is the degree to like how on [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=129.54000000000002s)]
*  top of what was happening as White House was Joe Biden, which, again, I think there's some [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=133.62s)]
*  interesting questions here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=139.22s)]
*  But but on the in the current world we live in, like Trump does come out every day and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=140.22s)]
*  like ask what he's signing when they give him his executive orders. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=145.74s)]
*  And on the single biggest piece of domestic legislation, which is this big, beautiful [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=150.54s)]
*  bill like he doesn't seem to be that in control of it at all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=154.7s)]
*  In fact, it seems like it was written by like, you know, the same people that have been running [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=159.82s)]
*  the party for 20 years fast. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=163.86s)]
*  Well, we know mental inocuity or whatever the word is comes in many forms. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=165.9s)]
*  The one that we're concerned about with Donald Trump oftentimes is that you don't know what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=170.54s)]
*  to expect of a decision. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=175.82s)]
*  There's no steady hand on the rail. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=177.46s)]
*  It's constantly in reversal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=178.74s)]
*  So, you know, you are in earlier in the show talking about the EU tariffs and the tariffs [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=180.7s)]
*  in general has been a kaleidoscope of on then off and on then off. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=184.18s)]
*  You take this weekend, there was post on True Social about Putin and he saw a very upset [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=187.98s)]
*  of Putin's killing civilians. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=192.54s)]
*  It wasn't just weeks ago when he brought Zelensky in and dressed him down for saying exactly [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=193.66s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=198.5s)]
*  We talk about the big, beautiful bill that you mentioned. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=199.94s)]
*  He said, don't f with Medicaid. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=201.66s)]
*  They cut Medicaid. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=203.54s)]
*  He says, we're not raising taxes on the rich. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=204.54s)]
*  Then he's not for that anymore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=206.62s)]
*  You know, every single day Doge cuts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=208.78s)]
*  I mean, he's moved all kinds of places on that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=210.66s)]
*  Every single day you get a reversal of some kind that you're just like, you know, you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  can't have any degree of confidence that there's a steady hand on the wheel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=217.5s)]
*  Yeah. And that and that that's where the sort of rubber hits the road fuzz on that Alexi [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  on that tariff point. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=225.38s)]
*  I mean, like Trump, you know, the Trump speech for West Point, which was genuinely bizarre [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=226.38s)]
*  and I mean, you can see how quiet it was. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=230.82s)]
*  It reminded me of when he went to talk to the Boy Scouts like eight years ago and he [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  was talking about like how how hot the women were on some boat of some friend that he knew [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=236.5s)]
*  in front of the Boy Scouts. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=242.18s)]
*  Sort of similar vibes here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=244.06s)]
*  But it's like, OK, well, that's that's just words. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's weird. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  But the tariffs are this one place where the words and the deed are the same. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=250.42s)]
*  Like he that is policy and they're being it's being made willy nilly back and forth [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=255.26s)]
*  with hundreds of billions of trillions are being traded on it and business decisions [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=260.02s)]
*  inside the rattling brain of this guy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=264.18s)]
*  Yeah, the consequences are huge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  They're global. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=270.18s)]
*  And like, yes, there are many questions being brought up about Biden. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=271.34s)]
*  He tripped over a sandbag. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=275.62s)]
*  What Donald Trump is doing is literally going to throw the country, the world into a trade [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=278.1s)]
*  war, going to turn the country into a recession. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=283.42s)]
*  I mean, to Fazz's point, it's really alarming when you look at the timing of these screeds [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=286.82s)]
*  on True Social, as well as his major policy announcements like 50 percent tariffs on the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  EU. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=296.62s)]
*  And then suddenly he's backtracking after a call that we're only getting his readout [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=297.62s)]
*  from, not anyone else's readout. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=301.46s)]
*  We also don't even know if he's actually talking to these people, who he's calling, who's calling [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=303.66s)]
*  him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=307.94s)]
*  It is really alarming. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=308.94s)]
*  And it's clear that he is detached from reality. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=310.58s)]
*  And that is the bigger problem than his rhetoric. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=314.34s)]
*  Yeah. And this other point about the sort of lack of stability, Fazz, this is this is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=316.86s)]
*  a kind of boring classic, like, I don't know, institutionalist point, but it's worth making. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=320.46s)]
*  And I think you will appreciate this because you've worked on staff. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=326.5s)]
*  Is that like process actually does matter and some process to make decisions matters [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=330.3s)]
*  and not just having the principal like go off half cocked all the time. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=336.54s)]
*  Your point about Russia, like what's the strategy there? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=342.54s)]
*  What's the process? There is none. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=345.42s)]
*  Who's in control? Who knows? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=347.58s)]
*  It's Steve Witkoff one moment or the next. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=349.74s)]
*  And it's like, again, the stakes here are a meat grinder of a war, the worst act of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=351.38s)]
*  aggression on the continent since World War Two. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=356.7s)]
*  And essentially just like tossing off tweets as policy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=359.62s)]
*  And I'll make another simplistic, naive point alongside yours, which is as staffers, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=363.86s)]
*  you're often trying to figure out what the boss wants to solve for. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=368.78s)]
*  What is the solution orientation that is motivating whatever positions that he's moving through? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't give you solution orientation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=378.86s)]
*  He wakes up with a grievance. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=381.86s)]
*  He's upset at Tim Cook because he's not going to the Middle East trip. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=383.14s)]
*  So we're going to levy some kind of tariffs on him, apparently. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  But as staff, when you're often working for principal, you're saying, where can I [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=389.74s)]
*  land this plane to do something positive? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=393.42s)]
*  And Trump's kind of constant movements don't give you even a big, beautiful bill, right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=396.22s)]
*  Don't give you a place to say this is where the president wants to land, what he wants to do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  There's no there's no stability in his decision making. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=406.3s)]
*  And thus chaos abounds. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's well said. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=410.62s)]
*  Alexi McCammond, Fez, Shakir. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=411.94s)]
*  Great to have you both. Thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=413.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLXSfC49aPE&t=423.42s)]
