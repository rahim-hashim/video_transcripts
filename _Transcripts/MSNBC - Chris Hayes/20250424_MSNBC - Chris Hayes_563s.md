# ‘Unpopular’: Trump whines about Fox News poll showing his approval rating cratering
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump is unpopular. He's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to force for an unpopular agenda and kind of hoping no one notices, but [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=5.28s)]
*  sometimes, once in a while, he gets caught and he has to retreat. Well today's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=9.24s)]
*  one of those days. Last night on this very program, we brought you this story, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  a story about the Trump administration announcing they were going to gut the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=17.28s)]
*  Women's Health Initiative, a groundbreaking 30-year study into [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=21.48s)]
*  preventative health care for post-menopausal women. It's funded by the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=25.92s)]
*  NIH, National Institutes of Health. It costs only about, get this, ten million [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=29.36s)]
*  dollars a year, the trillions of dollars in the federal budget. Now the Women's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=33.36s)]
*  Health Initiative has done a bunch of really important research on subjects [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=37.44s)]
*  like breast cancer and heart disease and osteoporosis. By the government's own [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=40.72s)]
*  estimate, it has saved countless lives and billions and billions of dollars in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=46.04s)]
*  medical costs. But Trump and Elon Musk tried to end it. And last night, we put a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=50.84s)]
*  spotlight on that. We asked, who exactly voted for this? Well it turns out, no, no [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=55.96s)]
*  one did. After spotlighting that story, lo and behold, get this, administration [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=61.0s)]
*  reversed course announcing today they're gonna keep funding the study. Federal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=65.8s)]
*  officials saying, don't worry, yeah, don't worry about that. Now if only the same [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  could be said for many of the other countless destructive budget cuts like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=74.62s)]
*  just for instance, eliminating inexplicably funding for National [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=78.28s)]
*  History Day, a competition where middle and high school kids share their love of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=82.12s)]
*  history. But fundamentally what they're banking on is that they're doing so much [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=85.72s)]
*  in so many different parts of the government that are so destructive, no [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=91.32s)]
*  one could just pay attention to all this stuff, right? It's gonna go past most [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  voters because what they are actually doing is really unpopular. Now the key [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  here is that Donald Trump wants you to believe desperately that he is popular. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=105.84s)]
*  It's all part of the con. Just because he managed to win a plurality of voters, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=109.12s)]
*  which he did, very poor approval ratings and four criminal cases tailing him, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=113.64s)]
*  including a conviction state court. And he did manage to win the popular vote, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=118.48s)]
*  unlike in 2016, it's the first time in three tries. But all of a sudden after [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=122.0s)]
*  that victory, the conventional wisdom quickly congealed that America was Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=126.36s)]
*  country, that he was a political colossus. Remember, the guy won by about a point [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=131.04s)]
*  and a half, hardly a landslide. He was inaugurated with basically the highest [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=137.32s)]
*  approval rating that he has ever had, which also happened to be the second [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=143.04s)]
*  lowest approval rating ever for a new president, topped only by himself the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  first time around. He has never been very popular and his approval rating has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=151.88s)]
*  only gone down since. Nate Silver tracks the average over on his substack. Full [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=157.84s)]
*  disclosure, some of the graphs on that site are really difficult to show on TV. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=162.76s)]
*  They require lots of explanation. This ain't one of them. See that there? You [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=166.6s)]
*  could see what's doing. Line just keeps going down. Even Fox News has no choice [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=171.88s)]
*  but to face this reality. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=177.16s)]
*  If you look at our new Fox News poll at 100 days job approval compared to other [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  presidents, there you see the president at 44% on you see his first term at 45% [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=184.96s)]
*  at this mark, the 100 day mark. We have other new polls that are revealing some [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=192.08s)]
*  concerns about the economy. Boy, that's a tough graphic. If you're Donald Trump [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=197.36s)]
*  sitting in the White House watching Fox News all day, that's the kind of clip [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=200.96s)]
*  that really gets Donald Trump yelling at the TV. In fact, he's now calling for [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=204.56s)]
*  Fox's pollster to be fired. Also says the Wall Street Journal sucks. We're not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  even 100 days in and Trump is already at the polls or fake stage. But again, they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  show what they show even at the granular level, right? When you dive into it and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=219.72s)]
*  you look through the numbers, you break his approval rating down by issue. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  Things don't get any better for him. I mean, he is underwater on basically [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  everything. Let's start with the economy. That's supposed to be Trump's bread and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  brother. Traditionally, it's been his biggest strength. That same Fox News poll [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=233.68s)]
*  has 56% of voters approving of Trump's handling of the economy. 38 approve [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  underwater by 18 points. And it's not hard to see why he ran on making things [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=244.76s)]
*  cheaper on day one. That was his promise. But maybe you've noticed things are not [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  Instead, he started a trade war tank. The stock market is about to make everything [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=254.68s)]
*  more expensive. New Reuters Ipsos poll shows disapproval of Trump's handling [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=259.08s)]
*  specifically on the cost of living at 57%. That Fox poll shows him with a 59% [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=263.64s)]
*  disapproval rating on inflation and a 58% disapproval rating on tariffs. A new [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=269.52s)]
*  Pew poll has disapproval of the tariffs at 59%. The data here is real, clisthor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=274.6s)]
*  clear, right? Keep in mind, and this is key, stuff hasn't even really started to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=281.12s)]
*  get more expensive yet. The fallout from the tariffs takes time. There's a delayed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=286.52s)]
*  reaction before we start seeing shortages and price hikes. Now, if that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=291.36s)]
*  happens, it's sort of an interesting question about what happens at Trump's [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=294.88s)]
*  numbers. Can they go lower? Can they break through the previous floor? But [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=299.36s)]
*  here's the thing. It is not just the economy, even on immigration, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=304.0s)]
*  Where he likes to pretend the country is just overwhelmingly united on his side, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=307.92s)]
*  he's slipping. Bunch of recent polls saw him underwater on issues of immigration, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=312.56s)]
*  ranging from about a point to as much as five points. That was not the case a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=317.04s)]
*  month or two months ago. That Fox News poll provides some interesting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  insights because when voters were asked about border security, Trump is doing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=324.72s)]
*  very well. But when they were asked about immigration at large, look at [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=329.12s)]
*  that. His approval is underwater. That, I think, is due to his neglect of due [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=332.68s)]
*  process. The stories of Kilmar or Brego Garcia, the young graduate students [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=337.36s)]
*  here totally legally who've done nothing wrong at colleges getting abducted [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=341.48s)]
*  off the street and put into prison. Or the people deported to a foreign gulag [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=345.92s)]
*  with no trial because they had an autism awareness tattoo. Not very [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=351.76s)]
*  popular. Look at this. Okay, a new economist, you go poll. Half of all [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=355.88s)]
*  Americans say Trump should return Kilmar or Brego Garcia, the U. S. Only [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  28% say he should not. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  Even Trump's so called war on woke. That was a key component of his campaign [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=368.74s)]
*  and a huge part of what they're doing. The government even that is underwater. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=373.16s)]
*  Look at this. His attacks on D. I, which are really attacks on civil rights law, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=377.0s)]
*  are unpopular. He's down nine points on the issue, according to one poll. Now, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=381.36s)]
*  instead of changing course, Trump is doing more of what voters say they [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=385.12s)]
*  dislike. In fact, yesterday he signed an executive order that seeks to just [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  straight up annihilate a key provision of the Civil Rights Act. He's basically [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  ordering the federal government to ignore what's called disparate impact. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  That's when some institution does something that on paper may look neutral, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=401.6s)]
*  but in practice ends up discriminating disproportionately one against one group [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=404.6s)]
*  or other. It's part of the original Civil Rights Act. It's a bedrock civil [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=408.32000000000005s)]
*  rights principle. It's something that Martin Luther King Jr and the people [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=412.04s)]
*  that generation marched for that they died to protect in this country. Trump [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=418.04s)]
*  signs an order, wanting to undo it. Now, I will say to be fair, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=422.92s)]
*  when he signed the order last night, it sure did seem like he was hearing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  about it for the first time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  Lastly, sir, we have an executive order on disparate impact theory. This is [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=431.36s)]
*  a theory that underlies a lot of the modern D. I. And C. R. T. Driven [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=434.56s)]
*  diversity culture. The basic idea here is instructing your departments and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=439.56s)]
*  agencies to no longer rely on disparate impact theory as they're regulating, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=443.88s)]
*  as they're issuing guidance, as they're making rules. We want to focus on [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  results. We want to focus on actual fairness. We want to focus on merit, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  not things like disparate impact theory and the whole sort of diversity, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=458.08s)]
*  equity and inclusion cult. It's getting out of that. Yes, sir. Yeah, he seems [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  to have total command. I don't think this stuff plays well with anyone. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=467.04s)]
*  Again, I don't want to overstate the case right? Like we're a very polarized [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  country. Trump just won an election that by all rights, I think it was [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=474.6s)]
*  preposterous. He won, but he won. There's enduring popularity among his [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=479.08s)]
*  base. But again, Trump keeps acting like he has a huge mandate. In reality, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  he is unpopular basically every turn because here's the thing, and this is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=490.08s)]
*  really key, and we've seen this now a few times. So whatever skills he has [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  at marketing and branding, and they are considerable, one has to say he does [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  not have the same skills for governing. Turns out people bought the packaging, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=503.8s)]
*  but once again, we're all reminded the product inside sucks. The only thing [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=509.56s)]
*  keeping him afloat is an agenda of intimidation and fear that enforces a [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=516.28s)]
*  politically toxic kind of discipline among Republicans in Washington. They [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=520.2s)]
*  feel they have to go along with his unpopular agenda. But I think, not [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=524.88s)]
*  guaranteed, I think it's going to catch up to them eventually. Because [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsMrauA8OGw&t=529.92s)]
