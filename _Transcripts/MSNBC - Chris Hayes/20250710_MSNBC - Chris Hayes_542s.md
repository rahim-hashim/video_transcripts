# Florida congressman's ‘unhinged, racist and Islamophobic’ posts under fire
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE)
*  When Donald Trump named Michael Waltz as his national security advisor back in January, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=0.0s)]
*  he's not in that job anymore, of course, Waltz had to leave his safe Republican congressional [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=5.4s)]
*  seat in Florida. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=9.48s)]
*  Half year later, Waltz is out of the administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=11.02s)]
*  His old house district is now represented by the legislator in this video. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=12.96s)]
*  Any type of facilitation that was you're done to next 30 seconds. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, 30 seconds is disgusting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=21.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=24.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=25.6s)]
*  Come on up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=26.6s)]
*  Enjoy your terrorist rag. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=27.6s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=28.6s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  I'm the chairman. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=32.2s)]
*  I can say what I want. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=33.2s)]
*  If you don't like it, you can leave. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=34.2s)]
*  The guy calling that a terrorist rag is Randy Fine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=38.0s)]
*  He's a Trump endorsed, extremely online, far right troll who has spent his short time [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=40.92s)]
*  in Congress launching a similar barrage of sort of predictably disgusting and bigoted [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=45.44s)]
*  statements. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=50.2s)]
*  Earlier this week, when Congresswoman Ilhan Omar criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Fine responded on social media, telling her, quote, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=56.44s)]
*  When Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded Fine apologize, he wrote, quote, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=66.48s)]
*  Fine has repeatedly called Omar and her colleague Rashida Tlaib and New York mayoral candidate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani Muslim terrorists. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=77.96s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=81.2s)]
*  He's also said protesters blocking roads is an act of terror, quote, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=91.36s)]
*  There are many, many, many more disgusting, bigoted, Islamophobic, particularly statements [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=103.16s)]
*  he's made. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I can't read to you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the public really calling out Fine's bigotry, but Republicans seem to have basically [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  normalized this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=116.16s)]
*  Like this, there was a time, there really was a time in my lifetime where this would [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=117.88s)]
*  be a scandal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=122.16s)]
*  And it's not a scandal anymore. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=123.16s)]
*  It's a selling point. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=124.16s)]
*  And sometimes you just really have to just take a step back to take in how degraded things [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=125.16s)]
*  have gotten. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=129.52s)]
*  Brendan Buck worked in communications for House speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=131.28s)]
*  Alex Wagner is a senior political analyst for MSNBC, and they both join me now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=135.08s)]
*  Brendan, let me ask you, do you think I feel like 15 years ago, 16 years ago, this calling [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  of member of Congress, a Muslim terrorist would be a scandal? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=146.48s)]
*  There be like calls to deal with it and things like that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=152.04s)]
*  But am I wrong about that? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=155.16s)]
*  No, I mean, this should be a record scratch moment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=158.92s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=162.2s)]
*  I mean, look, you know, I worked for two speakers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=163.2s)]
*  There were plenty of times where a speaker had to maybe even just quietly bring a member [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=166.32s)]
*  in and kind of remind them of what their expectations are around here and things we do and don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=171.0s)]
*  do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=175.72s)]
*  I'm just not sure that Mike Johnson or anybody in the leadership is really in a position [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=176.72s)]
*  to be able to do that right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=180.68s)]
*  Look, I don't want you to, I sincerely don't believe that he sees this as, or most Republicans [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=182.84s)]
*  there should see this as a selling point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=188.88s)]
*  Maybe this does something for him online. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=192.0s)]
*  I imagine the reaction from most of their members is ranging from gross to that's really [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  inconvenient for me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't think any of them are cheering for it, but none of them are probably in a position [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=201.44s)]
*  where they can actually do or say anything about it, because there's really only one [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=204.92s)]
*  speed right now, and that's you're on the attack all the time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=209.12s)]
*  And anybody who shows weakness is somehow aiding and abetting the opponent here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  And they're just not going to be willing to do that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=216.6s)]
*  So yeah, they're going to look the other way. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  This should be a layup. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=220.44s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy basically ran Steve King out of Congress for some of the things that he [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=221.68s)]
*  said. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  That wasn't that long ago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  That is the way that it used to be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=228.48s)]
*  It's just not anymore. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=229.6s)]
*  Alex, what do you think? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=232.04s)]
*  This is a guy that in Florida, Governor DeSantis has called someone who repels people, but [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  he also happens to be one of the architects of the Don't Stay Gay Act and the Stop Woke [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=239.12s)]
*  Act, which are now Republican orthodoxy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=243.4s)]
*  I got to say, Chris, I thought about his kind of anti-Muslim, which is being generous, tirade [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=247.2s)]
*  against Ilhan Omar in the context of his broader, I guess we'll say struggle against what he [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=253.76s)]
*  calls anti-Semitism. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  This is happening in the context of like Elon Musk's Nazi Grok AI chatbot going out there [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=260.32s)]
*  and spewing hate speech. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=267.24s)]
*  It has been fed that hate speech because conservatives demanded a, you know, information-free, free [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=269.48s)]
*  speech platform, which Elon Musk created for them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  And where, I ask, is Randy Fine in the context of that fight against anti-Semitism? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  He's nowhere, because it's not about anti-Semitism. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not about principle. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=291.64s)]
*  It's a completely tribal fight, us versus them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=293.52s)]
*  And that's the essential battle here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  It's cloaked in anti-Semitism. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=300.2s)]
*  It's cloaked in the sort of religious fervor. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=301.88s)]
*  But it's truly about owning the libs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=304.32s)]
*  That's all it is in the cruelest, basest way possible, which is, and by the way, dovetails [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=306.16s)]
*  with the agenda of stop, woke, and don't say gay. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  This is all about a sort of tribal group think. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=313.88000000000005s)]
*  And he's been involved in all of it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think we should think of that as a coincidence. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Raul. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  I just want to follow up with you and then I'll come back to you, Brendan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=324.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, one of the things I think that they've unlocked on the right is that if there aren't [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=328.48s)]
*  people inside your own party calling something to question, it goes away as a scandal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=332.96s)]
*  Like the only logs that can get thrown to a fire of a scandal are like George Santos, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=339.23999999999995s)]
*  right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Like if people on your own side are calling for it, then it is a scandal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  But if you keep everyone together, no matter what, it goes away. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=349.0s)]
*  I don't think Democrats have sort of figured that out, nor maybe should they. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=352.64s)]
*  But that does seem like part of the dynamic here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=355.96s)]
*  Totally. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=357.96s)]
*  I mean, if you have someone that sort of bucks the trend and someone who raises the flag [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=359.96s)]
*  and says this isn't okay from a corner that isn't normally ringing the alarm bell, then [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=363.44s)]
*  it goes by without passage. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=367.96s)]
*  And I do think when Randy Fine came to Congress, the expectation was a real fighter's coming [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  to Washington, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=375.64s)]
*  This is part of the brand. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=376.76s)]
*  And it's seen as, you know, this is the DNA of MAGAism, fight, fight, fight. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=378.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I just I don't know, I mean, I respect everything Brendan has to say about Congress. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=383.76s)]
*  But I don't know that there isn't some kind of lust for more of this attitude, which is, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=389.4s)]
*  again, tribalism at all costs. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=394.96s)]
*  Well there's a question, right, Brendan, if the lust for that attitude, and I think there [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=398.4s)]
*  is lust for this attitude, if it comes from the voters in the primaries, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  Or it comes from the people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Like I'm not necessarily sure where it comes from. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  It does seem like it's coming in some ways from voters in low-term out primaries. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=410.76s)]
*  I'm not sure if it's coming from somewhere else, also coming from the culture. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=415.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, I mean, this was a candidate, at least, that people saw a lot of red flags [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=419.88s)]
*  with. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this was, let's remember, this was a person we actually feared was going to lose [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  in a ruby red seat in Florida. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=429.56s)]
*  He ended up winning somewhat comfortably, but there was a lot of concern about his ability [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=432.48s)]
*  to actually win that seat. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  So I do still believe, again, that he is a bit of an outlier here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=437.88s)]
*  He is not sort of your median House Republican, as much as we sort of paint them as all sort [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=442.56s)]
*  of nuts. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=446.96s)]
*  But the problem, I think... [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=447.96s)]
*  I would never say Randy Fine is a median House Republican, to be clear. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=450.52s)]
*  Okay, I appreciate that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=455.48s)]
*  Look, we've been having this back and forth now for like six years, where we're just throwing [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=457.52s)]
*  censures back and forth at people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=462.04s)]
*  At some point, if you're engaging in this, you are doing a censure because you want to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=464.68s)]
*  take the moral high ground, right? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  You're censuring Ilhan Omar because you think she has said something so repugnant. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=471.36s)]
*  You would think then that you would be in a position where one of your members says [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=476.12s)]
*  something like that, you are going to self-police. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=479.2s)]
*  But if you're not self-policing your own side, this is all just sort of a partisan game where [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=481.72s)]
*  you're playing gotcha with whoever said the next thing, because the consequences matter [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=486.04s)]
*  less and less. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=490.0s)]
*  It used to be a big deal if you got censured. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=491.0s)]
*  Now it's something that's kind of like a badge of honor. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=492.84s)]
*  So of course it hasn't stopped. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  This, I think, is the thing, the broader thing that I think we're seeing is the degradation [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=496.44s)]
*  of the notion of taboo or offense or anything or scandal to sort of omnidirectionally in [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=502.11999999999995s)]
*  a way that I think is probably not for the best of the society. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=508.64s)]
*  But we'll take that up another day. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=511.23999999999995s)]
*  Brendan Buck and Alex Wagner, thank you both. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=514.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjv9O7j5LE&t=522.84s)]
