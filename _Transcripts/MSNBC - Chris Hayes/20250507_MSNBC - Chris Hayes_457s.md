# 'Clock ticking': GOP stressed over how to pass Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. You know for all of Donald Trump's authoritarianism and his assault on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=0.0s)]
*  rights and bulldozing the institutions of our government the Trump administration this time around has been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=5.8s)]
*  really bad at actually [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=11.84s)]
*  Legislating like the stuff of making laws this stuff of democracy. I mean remember [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=13.84s)]
*  Republicans came in with the government trifecta and while Trump has set records for executive orders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=19.32s)]
*  He hasn't exactly been setting records for laws. He's signed. In fact, you can literally count them on one hand [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=24.84s)]
*  Trump has so far signed just five bills into law [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=31.44s)]
*  Fewer than any president in the first hundred days of an administration since at least Dwight D [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=35.36s)]
*  Eisenhower in the 1950s according to an NBC News analysis. That's pretty wild, right? Like Donald Trump [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=41.2s)]
*  He's got this big agenda. They're like totally transforming the government. He's got congressional majorities that you know [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  He controls [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  Now one big reason for the lack of Trump legislation this time around is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=55.699999999999996s)]
*  That Republicans have set up a kind of division of labor that works for them not for the people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  Trump gets to play king and he issues all the decrees he wants and members of Congress get to kind of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=64.86s)]
*  Shred their shoulders when they get confronted in town halls by constituents asking things like why did you fire the park rangers? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=69.9s)]
*  Why are you giving Elon Musk and his crew access to my personal info? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=77.02s)]
*  Why did the Social Security administration call me dead? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=81.02000000000001s)]
*  but there was a clock ticking on this because [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=84.78s)]
*  Trump and Republicans do have this really big thing. They want to do it's an agenda [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=87.42s)]
*  they can only achieve through legislation which is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=91.18s)]
*  cut taxes for rich people and cut health care for non rich people and that happens to be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=94.34s)]
*  Really really unpopular like incredibly unpopular if you can remember all the way back to Trump's term [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  First term a lot of us blocked it out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=106.66s)]
*  But his most unpopular moments aside from January 6 right before then his most unpopular moves [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  Were his two big legislative pushes. The first was his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=115.38s)]
*  unsuccessful attempt at [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=120.14s)]
*  Repealing the Affordable Care Act which ended in the middle of the night with Republican John McCain's notorious thumbs down on the Senate floor [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=121.86s)]
*  And the second was the successful Republican attempt to cut taxes for corporations and rich people [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  Adding one and a half trillion dollars to the national debt. It did however have a capuchy name [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  It was called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=139.02s)]
*  Decent branding and this time around [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=143.3s)]
*  congressional Republicans seemed inclined to put their priorities into a few separate bills because it's a lot and the politics are quite tricky and they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=145.94s)]
*  Have a especially historically narrow margin in the house [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=153.22000000000003s)]
*  But instead the president has been obsessed with another strategy laid out in December by former Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  economic adviser and current Fox business host Larry Kudlow [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=162.94s)]
*  Put together a real [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=167.54s)]
*  Reconciliation bill that includes border security and tax cuts. That's what I want. We absolutely [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=169.94s)]
*  Can do that and the plan is to put the border security and some defense [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=175.86s)]
*  components of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=183.18s)]
*  Reconciliation out first and then follow it up with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=185.18s)]
*  No [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=188.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no all at once ma'am all at once as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=190.66s)]
*  sources close to President Trump are telling us [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=197.78s)]
*  He was like one big beautiful bill. I mean who doesn't love a good BBB [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=202.26s)]
*  Sources close to Trump. So this time around right Republicans have combined get this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=209.54s)]
*  They've combined the two least popular elements from Trump's last term [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=214.5s)]
*  the tax cut for rich people and cuts to health care for the non-rich into [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=218.66s)]
*  one big beautiful bill [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=223.34s)]
*  Republicans who are bad at governing but decent at messaging came up with a big beautiful name for the bill is gonna be called the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=225.38s)]
*  Renewing the American Dream Act, which you know sounds good [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=231.7s)]
*  But when Trump heard that according to punch bowl reporter Jake Sherman, he had Cudlow's reaction to the name [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=235.94s)]
*  No, no, no, you actually have to call it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=242.04s)]
*  one big beautiful bill [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=245.64s)]
*  Well, I like one big beautiful bill and I always have I always will one big beautiful bill [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=248.16s)]
*  I like to name it that if you can that gorgeous big beautiful bill a big beautiful bill as I call it our big [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=253.98s)]
*  Beautiful bill great big beautiful bill [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=261.0s)]
*  Beautiful bill and we're trying to come up with a name and I said, why don't we just go with the great big beautiful bill? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  I think now I think we can finally say one big beautiful bill. We're gonna abbreviate it as the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=269.72s)]
*  OB BB or is it just a BBB? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=275.72s)]
*  Republicans were even better at caving in Donald Trump from the art of messaging have decided to name the bill [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=279.92s)]
*  One big beautiful bill, which is just perfect [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  Here's the thing you can call it whatever you want. The bills substance is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  extraordinarily unpopular [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=294.16s)]
*  It of course extends tax cuts for businesses and billionaires it boosts spending on immigration enforcement by [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  Iwatering amounts. I mean enormous and morose amounts along with huge increases to the Pentagon budget [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  Jacking up the debt ceiling and would cost so much. It's stressing out almost everyone on Capitol Hill as [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  NBC News reports Republicans facing tough reelection fights in the 2026 midterm elections are worried [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=316.0s)]
*  It's not mathematically possible to achieve their spending targets without a steep cut to Medicaid [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=322.0s)]
*  citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office because you see in order to offset part of the bills costs they need to find a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=327.04s)]
*  whopping [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=333.88s)]
*  880 billion dollars in Medicaid cuts. That's a lot. So here's the thing Mike Johnson congressional Republicans are caught in this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=334.8s)]
*  uneasy political position [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=343.32s)]
*  They have already been trying to duck headlines and constituents as Elon Musk's waves his chainsaw around [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=345.32s)]
*  Unilaterally slashing benefits all over the place and now members are asking themselves this crucial question [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=351.56s)]
*  How exactly do you cut eight hundred billion dollars from Medicaid without people realizing you are cutting? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  eight hundred billion dollars from Medicaid [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  They not only have to find these cuts and get agreement on them from their caucus [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=366.68s)]
*  They also have to kind of work out a cover story like what kind of story they're going to tell people about these cuts [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=370.16s)]
*  And so far it's not going well. I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=376.62s)]
*  Have to ask one question about the the tax bill will we get it before Memorial Day? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  No, no, there's no way because again, unfortunately president Trump chose the one big beautiful bill [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=386.52s)]
*  What he should have done is the multiple step process [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  I suggested three steps get the border funding second step just extend current tax law [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=394.7s)]
*  So we take an automatic we get it before the end of the year quickly [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=400.38s)]
*  Not if we don't come down with a reasonable pre-pandemic level spending there's enough of us in the Senate that will not agree to that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=405.24s)]
*  Boy, that's bad news. Oh boy. It is bad news [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=410.72s)]
*  Well for them because they're trying to preserve tax cuts that expire the end of the year on the other side of that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=414.24s)]
*  They're facing midterm elections with the president who's polling worse than any other president ever at the hundred-day mark of his administration [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=419.0s)]
*  And they have yet not started doing the thing that will most likely be the least popular thing they do [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=425.24s)]
*  Slashing Medicaid benefits to finance more tax cuts [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-E175cZRoY&t=431.76s)]
