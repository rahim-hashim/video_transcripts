# ‘Political retribution’: Newark mayor speaks out on Trump DOJ charging Dem congresswoman
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA)
*  Joining me now is Ross Baraka, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=0.0s)]
*  Mayor of Newark and a Democratic Governor, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=2.16s)]
*  Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=4.42s)]
*  Mayor, it's good to have you on the program. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=6.96s)]
*  First, just as someone who was there that day, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=8.58s)]
*  your reaction to the announcement of these charges. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, I think the Congresswoman will be vindicated. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=17.52s)]
*  When people see the video from the beginning to the end, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=21.76s)]
*  you'll see actually what happened in there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=24.36s)]
*  This is a lot of theater that's going on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=26.64s)]
*  It's been going on for some time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=29.0s)]
*  And obviously, when this thing gets to court, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=31.16s)]
*  I think she'll be completely vindicated. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=33.92s)]
*  I didn't see her do anything wrong while she was there at all. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  All I hear was people yelling, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=41.36s)]
*  get your hands off her, get your hands off her, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=43.8s)]
*  get your hands off her. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=45.68s)]
*  I mean, that's what sticks in my head the entire time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=46.68s)]
*  I want to play for you what the President [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=50.84s)]
*  said today defending this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=52.28s)]
*  He had some interesting words. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=53.96s)]
*  He kept talking about woke, somewhat inexplicably, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  but I'll play it for you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=58.16s)]
*  And have a look, and I want to get your response. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=59.16s)]
*  This is what the President said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=61.63999999999999s)]
*  The President is weaponizing with the arrest [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=65.11999999999999s)]
*  of a congresswoman, a Democratic congresswoman. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=71.56s)]
*  Oh, give me a break. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=73.32s)]
*  Did you see her? She was out of control. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=74.12s)]
*  Did you? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=75.8s)]
*  Those days are over. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=76.44s)]
*  The days of woke are over. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=77.72s)]
*  That woman, I have no idea who she is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=82.6s)]
*  That woman was out of control. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=85.64s)]
*  She was shoving federal agents. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=87.32s)]
*  She was out of control. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=88.92s)]
*  The days of that crap are over in this country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=90.52s)]
*  We're going to have law and order. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=93.28s)]
*  Do you understand why the President said the days of woke [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  are over in reference to criminal charges [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=98.36s)]
*  against a sitting member of Congress? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Right, being woke is not a crime. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=104.88s)]
*  It's actually the opposite of being asleep. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  It means being aware and being focused [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=108.36s)]
*  and understanding what's going on around you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=110.08s)]
*  I mean, the fact that he used that kind of identifies [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  that this is political, the target of it is political, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  is political retribution. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  It is focusing on people who he thinks disagrees with him, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=120.64s)]
*  his philosophy, the direction he wants to take the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=125.12s)]
*  Saying woke and along with criminal charges at the same time [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  really kind of devalues the whole process in the first place. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=132.84s)]
*  And it really speaks to this kind of authoritarianism [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=136.44s)]
*  that we're experiencing in this country right now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=139.36s)]
*  You were arrested on that day, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=142.68s)]
*  and I think somewhat inexplicably, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=144.04s)]
*  they said you were trespassing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=146.12s)]
*  And then this sort of turn of events [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  in which those charges against you were dropped [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  right before these charges are announced. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=152.32s)]
*  I want to read to you what the acting U.S. attorney [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=153.88s)]
*  in New Jersey had to say. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=158.48s)]
*  After extensive consideration, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=160.76s)]
*  we have agreed to dismiss Mayor Baraka's misdemeanor [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  charge of trespass for the sake of moving forward. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=164.68s)]
*  In the spirit of public interest, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=167.44s)]
*  I've invited the mayor to tour Delaney Hall. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=168.6s)]
*  The government has nothing to hide at this facility. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  I will personally accompany the mayor [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  so he can see that firsthand. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  Do you understand why the charges are dropped? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=176.55999999999997s)]
*  Are you gonna get into that facility? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, the charges were baseless, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  and I'm thankful that we agreed that they should be dropped. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=185.04s)]
*  We are gonna get into the facility. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=189.72s)]
*  And I would love to have a tour, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  but it's not about me touring it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=193.32s)]
*  I mean, it's not Disney World. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=195.0s)]
*  We were there basically to get the inspections done. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  They began to let our inspectors in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=200.16s)]
*  They were still in court arguing about the idea [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  of them needing a certificate of occupancy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  in order to move forward. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=209.2s)]
*  That was our basic contention from the beginning. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=210.2s)]
*  And in fact, they weren't letting our inspectors in. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=212.48s)]
*  And this was a conflict we were having with the GEO Group [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=215.88s)]
*  and not with the government or ICE [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  because GEO Group owns the property. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=220.48s)]
*  So our contention was with them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=222.88s)]
*  How it turned into all of this is beyond me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=225.04s)]
*  Yeah, just to be clear, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=228.28s)]
*  the GEO Group is a sort of third party vendor and contractor [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=229.16s)]
*  does a lot on the immigration side [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=232.76s)]
*  in terms of immigration detention facilities. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=236.32s)]
*  They own that property, they run that property. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=238.44s)]
*  It was your contention [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  that they did not have a certificate of occupancy, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=243.44s)]
*  which folks I think who've ever run a business [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=246.08s)]
*  or apartment or house know you need to have one. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=248.0s)]
*  So, and your municipal inspectors were not let in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=252.4s)]
*  And you're just saying that they're just out of line. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Like they are out of code with the city of Newark [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=257.2s)]
*  at a basic sort of boring mundane municipal level. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=260.28s)]
*  100%. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=265.96s)]
*  And they're arguing that they have a certificate [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=267.36s)]
*  of occupancy for almost 20 years ago. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  We're saying that that's invalid [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=271.2s)]
*  and I need to go through the process. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=272.92s)]
*  And it's okay for them to disagree with us, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  but there's, we have instruments in place [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=276.2s)]
*  when people disagree is called the court, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Courts make decisions about which way we go forward, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  who's right and who's wrong. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=283.88s)]
*  Nobody else has the right to make that decision [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=285.76s)]
*  except a judge. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=288.36s)]
*  And we were in the process of doing that in fact. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=289.52s)]
*  And they made a decision to do what they did. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=293.56s)]
*  So, and we're still in court as a matter of fact. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, my understanding is it right, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=298.44s)]
*  and it's correct if I'm wrong here, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=299.96s)]
*  but that you were offered a plea deal [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=301.2s)]
*  by this acting US attorney Alina Haba on your own charges. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=304.4s)]
*  And you said, no, I didn't do anything. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=307.76s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=309.48s)]
*  No, I mean, ultimately the lawyers discussed [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=311.32s)]
*  what it would mean to drop the charges [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=314.44s)]
*  and we agreed together to drop those charges, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=316.92s)]
*  to dismiss them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=320.04s)]
*  And we got to an amenable place and we did it, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I'm glad that they made the decision to do that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=324.52s)]
*  I thought the charges were baseless in the first place. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=327.4s)]
*  And so we get a chance to move on, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  but unfortunately we have to now organize around [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  what's going on with the Congresswoman [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=334.84s)]
*  who is the representative of the Congress. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=336.48s)]
*  The representative of my district, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  congressional district number 10, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=341.24s)]
*  who is now under these more baseless [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=343.0s)]
*  kind of accusations as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=345.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna just read what the Congresswoman [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  said this morning about, she basically says, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  look, they're trying to get me to plea, to roll over, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  And I didn't do anything wrong. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=353.8s)]
*  Take a listen to what she had to say. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=354.8s)]
*  Well, the Justice Department and Alina Haba [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  wanted me to admit to doing something that I did not do. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  And I was not going to do that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=364.36s)]
*  Once again, I came there to do my job [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  and conduct an oversight visit, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=369.12s)]
*  and they wanted me to say something differently, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  and I'm not doing that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=372.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you agree with that characterization, I imagine? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=375.32000000000005s)]
*  I imagine, do you think it's a good idea [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=377.68s)]
*  that she not plead to something? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=379.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think she did anything. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, and you can't make people confess [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=386.16s)]
*  to something they didn't do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=390.0s)]
*  That's what we have court for. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  I think the video was cleared. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=392.6s)]
*  There's enough witnesses that were there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=394.04s)]
*  And I think that she's gonna be vindicated. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=396.72s)]
*  I think it's silly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=398.24s)]
*  And in an overall sense, as was stated on this, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=399.76s)]
*  is a kind of weaponization of the Department of Justice, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=403.0s)]
*  the US Attorney's Office, to target individuals [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=406.04s)]
*  because they disagree with them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=408.32s)]
*  And that's really authoritarian, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=409.8s)]
*  and we should get away from that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=411.04s)]
*  as far as we possibly can. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=412.48s)]
*  Newark Mayor Roz Baraka, who was there that day, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=414.92s)]
*  apprehended and then released. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=417.64s)]
*  Charges dropped within the last 24 hours. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much, appreciate it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=422.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCpljW7iWA&t=428.24s)]
