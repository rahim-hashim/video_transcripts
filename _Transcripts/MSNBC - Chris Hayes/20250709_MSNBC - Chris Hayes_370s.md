# ‘Full Nazi’: Elon Musk's AI chatbot started calling itself 'MechaHitler'
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34)
*  Among all the other things happening at X today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=0.0s)]
*  the company's CEO, a woman named Linda Jacarino, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=3.12s)]
*  announced she's leaving after just two years in the job. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=6.32s)]
*  In a lengthy post, Jacarino wrote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=8.84s)]
*  ''When Elon Musk and I first spoke of his vision for X, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=10.88s)]
*  I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=13.4s)]
*  out the extraordinary mission of this company. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=15.76s)]
*  I'm immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=17.92s)]
*  the responsibility of protecting free speech, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=20.68s)]
*  turning the company around and transforming X into the Everything app.'' [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=22.68s)]
*  Elon Musk simply responded, ''Thank you for your contributions.'' [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  After Musk bought the site, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=33.4s)]
*  Jacarino was brought in to be the adult in the room, I guess, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  but she may have gotten more than she bargained for with her boss's rants, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=38.04s)]
*  a platform that seems to court right-winging spree risks, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=41.0s)]
*  and a high-profile AI chatbot that refers to itself as Mecca Hitler. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=43.6s)]
*  Brian Barrett is the Executive Editor of News at Wired, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=48.0s)]
*  which has done extensive coverage of Grok, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=50.72s)]
*  Elon Musk, and he joins me now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=52.56s)]
*  Brian, let me first start on the Jacarino news and the question of whether we [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=55.28s)]
*  know if her departure was at all related to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=59.32s)]
*  the extraordinary and appalling meltdown of the Grok AI system yesterday. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=62.72s)]
*  I'll say first that we don't know. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=69.64s)]
*  You could certainly see how it might be the last straw, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=72.56s)]
*  but I will say there were plenty of other straws [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  before this that could have been the last one. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=77.12s)]
*  If you're not leaving over the white genocide incident [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=79.28s)]
*  that you mentioned that happened in May, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=81.68s)]
*  this is worse, but it's all pretty bad. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=84.08s)]
*  I think there are some other factors to consider here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  One is that X is now a part of XAI. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  It got absorbed by the AI company that Elon Musk also owns, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=91.36s)]
*  so her roles diminished there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=95.0s)]
*  Also, she came in as someone who could make nice with advertisers, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=96.6s)]
*  bring them back to the platform. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=100.56s)]
*  Now that X is evolving into A, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  an everything app with payments and who knows what else, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=105.6s)]
*  and B, an AI forward Mecca Hitler app, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=108.32s)]
*  it's less clear what her role would be. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=112.6s)]
*  So it makes sense that she would head out now, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=114.44s)]
*  but I don't know that you could say this is the one thing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=117.72s)]
*  where she finally said enough is enough. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=119.84s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about what happened with Grok. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=123.88s)]
*  I was horrified and fascinated in equal measure. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=125.48s)]
*  I mean, it's clear that there's a thing that happens on X all the time, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=131.92s)]
*  which is there'll be something and then Grok will fact check it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=137.24s)]
*  and seem to be kind of a liberal or correct right-wing misinformation, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=139.96s)]
*  and then all the right-wing people on the app get so mad at it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=144.8s)]
*  So do we actually, A, do we know why this happened, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  and B, why it took them so long to put a stop to it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=152.96s)]
*  Well, in terms of why it happened, I think you can look at, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  you mentioned before they added these system prompts that said, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=162.24s)]
*  don't shy away from politically incorrect material. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  And there was another one there too that said, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  don't necessarily trust the media, media sources. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=170.27999999999997s)]
*  So that combined was a factor, certainly. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  But then also you got to remember that these AI models, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  when you're knowledge-based, when you're training data, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  comprises the entirety of the internet, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  there's a lot of really bad stuff on the internet, which we all know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=185.04s)]
*  So when you don't put in the right guardrails or when you remove guardrails, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  it's garbage in, garbage out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=192.16s)]
*  And I think that's what we saw. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  I think we went, any of these AI models, if you let them run rampant, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=194.16s)]
*  that's probably what they'll do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=197.4s)]
*  That's why companies spend so much money trying to prevent this from happening. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=198.52s)]
*  I mean, to me, the part that was fascinating, right, is to the degree to which [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  the system prompt was, don't worry about things that are politically incorrect, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  right, and then you train this LLM on all the content of the internet, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  that it just took that prompt, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=215.4s)]
*  That the sort of neural network mapping of the conceptual deep meaning of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=218.08s)]
*  don't be politically incorrect is go full Hitler at the level of the model itself. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=224.48s)]
*  We want to be a little bit careful because we don't know for sure, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=233.4s)]
*  there may be stuff going on behind the scenes, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=235.64s)]
*  there may be some other tweaks that are made, but fundamentally, yes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=237.96s)]
*  I think it at least speaks to the ethos of, hey, we're going to let you run a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  little bit wild, we're going to give you an inch, you're going to take several [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=244.72s)]
*  miles in this case of hate speech and terrible things. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=247.88s)]
*  What is the success level of X? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=252.32s)]
*  I feel like it was clear it was losing a ton of revenue, it was losing a ton of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=257.28s)]
*  value. When Trump got elected, there was this sort of sense that the administration [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=261.48s)]
*  and X would successfully bully advertisers to come back to the platform. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=266.24s)]
*  There was even reporting about administration officials doing the FTC [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=270.84s)]
*  investigation into possible conspiracy to obstruct trade. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=275.84s)]
*  But where does this thing stand? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=281.12s)]
*  I think when you talk about the success level of X, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=286.6s)]
*  it's important not to get too caught up in dollars and cents. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=289.44s)]
*  I think it's clearly lost a ton of users, it's clearly not a happy place for [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=292.24s)]
*  advertisers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=296.92s)]
*  I thought it was interesting that Linda Icarino said that she had done so [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=297.6s)]
*  much to restore advertiser trust, that's gone now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=301.16s)]
*  But I think success for X is really how much can it advance Elon Musk's agenda, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  how much can it be his personal playground, how much can he use it as a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=309.68s)]
*  lever for power. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=312.08s)]
*  And I think clearly it's done that in spades for him. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=313.16s)]
*  So monetarily, probably lost, but he's got $200 billion. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=316.6s)]
*  He doesn't care that much, I would imagine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=321.16s)]
*  And it's still a really great place for him to hang out with his like-minded [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=323.76s)]
*  buddies. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=327.8s)]
*  And his personal AI, Brian Barrett at Wired, which I have to say has been doing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=330.56s)]
*  some of the finest reporting in this Trump administration. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=334.6s)]
*  I read you guys constantly on a subscriber and you're doing amazing work. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=338.24s)]
*  So thank you for all the work you guys are doing over there. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1cgTPqNQ34&t=341.44s)]
