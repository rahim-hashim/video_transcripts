# ‘We need to do some rewriting’: Trump official caught trying to alter intel report
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME)
*  We're in the midst of one of, I think, the worst intelligence scandal since the Iraq [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=0.0s)]
*  War, and it's less than six months into Trump's second term. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=3.88s)]
*  This administration's lawless resurrection of the 200-year-old wartime law to rendition [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=7.12s)]
*  people out of this country was always, I think, on its face ridiculous. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=12.72s)]
*  We know that we're not experiencing World War I or World War II, the other times it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=16.28s)]
*  was used, the War of 1812. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=20.2s)]
*  And not only does Donald Trump still have to pretend we're at war, his administration [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  had to concoct an elaborate conspiracy to justify it, whereby this Venezuelan gang, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=26.76s)]
*  Tren de Uruguay, is somehow under the direction of the Venezuelan government, and therefore [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=32.36s)]
*  Venezuela is invading our country with its gang members, which means we are at war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=37.0s)]
*  Obviously all that is ludicrous. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=43.44s)]
*  We all know that, right? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, it turns out the people inside the intelligence community knew it too. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=47.64s)]
*  New York Times reporting in March, quote, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Well, now we find out the chief of staff for the director of national intelligence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=56.76s)]
*  is essentially trying to cook the books and rewrite the National Intelligence Council's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=70.08s)]
*  official assessment to match the White House's lie. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=74.8s)]
*  In an email to intelligence officials on April 3rd, Tulsi Gabber's chief of staff, Joe Kent, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  wrote, quote, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=83.72s)]
*  Let's just come out and say Tren de Uruguay leaders are given sanctuary in Venezuela as [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=84.72s)]
*  their gang members commit horrendous crimes in America. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=97.2s)]
*  The acting head of the National Intelligence Council did make those edits in a new intelligence [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=101.32s)]
*  assessment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=105.52s)]
*  But Gabber fired him and his deputy anyway, smearing them as biased deep state bureaucrats. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=106.52s)]
*  Charlie Savage is one of the New York Times reporters behind this story, and he joins [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  me now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  So Charlie, just walk me through what the sort of intelligence community itself found [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=116.56s)]
*  when it was doing the work and what the reaction was from the chief of staff for the DNI. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=121.96s)]
*  So this is a convoluted story that you did a good job of setting it up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=129.64s)]
*  There were two intelligence assessments. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=133.04s)]
*  In February, when the Trump White House is getting ready to issue this Alien Enemies [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=135.8s)]
*  Act proclamation to summarily remove Venezuelans without due process, sent them to that notorious [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=142.0s)]
*  Salvadoran prison, they asked for an assessment of the relationship between Venezuela's government [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=149.12s)]
*  and this gang because that old law you described requires a connection to the actions of a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=155.8s)]
*  foreign state to be in this sort of wartime situation where its extra powers would be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  activatable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=167.16s)]
*  The intelligence community looks at their collections, the NSA, the CIA, FBI, everybody [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=168.52s)]
*  else. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=173.04s)]
*  There is a broad consensus that the gang is not under the direction and control of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=174.04s)]
*  Maduro regime in Venezuela. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  They're hostile to each other. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=181.12s)]
*  The government treats them as a threat. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  The security forces get in gunfights with them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=184.96s)]
*  The gang itself is too disorganized to obey instructions even if there were any. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=187.84s)]
*  There's a little bit of a partial, not complete, dissent by the FBI based on a few prisoners [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=192.72s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=197.2s)]
*  But the rest of the intelligence community thinks they're lying, they're making stuff [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=198.2s)]
*  up to try to get out of their own legal troubles. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  There's no intercepted communications, no intercepted financial data that you would [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=204.52s)]
*  see if there was this kind of coordination. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=208.44s)]
*  So the intelligence community says this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=210.44s)]
*  The White House says, we're going to say the opposite in this proclamation anyway. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=212.44s)]
*  The White House says the cop will come out in mid-March and he says, I find as president [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=216.92s)]
*  that it's true that the Venezuelan gang is being controlled by this government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=220.68s)]
*  And that sets off when it's revealed that they said something that their government [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=225.56s)]
*  actually thinks is a lie to activate these powers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=230.44s)]
*  That sets off this effort to redo the intelligence assessment. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=233.64s)]
*  And then even when it's in draft form, the chief of staff to Tulsi Gabbard asks for a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=238.2s)]
*  further rewrite so it cannot be used to damage Trump for having said the opposite. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=243.48s)]
*  Now, you know, I think people of a certain age who particularly came up as reporters [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=248.48s)]
*  in the midst of the Iraq war learned intimately in that, that it's extremely dangerous to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=252.76s)]
*  have political appointees sort of pushing down and altering intelligence because what [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=262.12s)]
*  you want intelligence to do is to tell you what really the best assessment is, not what [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=267.68s)]
*  pleases the boss, not what's politically convenient. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=272.8s)]
*  Obviously, in the case of Iraq, that was a whole other story. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=275.44s)]
*  I mean, Kent's email to me strikes me as like wildly sort of out of line and anomalous for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=278.36s)]
*  how these things usually go down. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=284.16s)]
*  But maybe I'm wrong. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=286.24s)]
*  What's your sort of understanding? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=287.24s)]
*  I mean, there's something very blatant about this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=291.2s)]
*  Even in Iraq, you know, the worst parts of Iraq were the insinuations by the Bush administration [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=294.92s)]
*  that Saddam Hussein was connected to al-Qaeda and somehow responsible for 9-11, even though [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=301.92s)]
*  they hated him as a secular ruler. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=308.2s)]
*  That certainly was not a connection at all between al-Qaeda and Iraq. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  But they didn't produce official proclamations and write intelligence memos saying that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=315.96s)]
*  They would just sort of insinuate it and kind of put it out as a vibe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=322.08s)]
*  And this is an effort to create official documents that are just saying things for which there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  is no evidence or what the available evidence actually actively contradicts. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  And so in that sense, it's not just comparable to Iraq, but it's actually its own thing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=339.94000000000005s)]
*  It's something more blatant. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=346.16s)]
*  The individual, the chief of staff here, I think hasn't gotten quite enough attention [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  is Joe Kent. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=352.16s)]
*  Now, he is a failed Republican congressional candidate twice. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=353.16s)]
*  He ran in a district that was quite Republican and was beat twice by congressional Democrat [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=356.6s)]
*  Mary Gleason Camperez. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=363.36s)]
*  She now represents the most Trump-voting district in the country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  And the reason for that is Mr. Kent's past statements, affiliations and associations [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=368.36s)]
*  with certain extremists proved to be a burden on the campaign trail. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=374.56s)]
*  He's now the guy basically, I mean, chief of staff for DNI is a big deal. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=379.16s)]
*  Like he's kind of operationally running the American intelligence apparatus. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=382.12s)]
*  Well, he's only doing that right now, too. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=386.6s)]
*  He is also the pending nominee to be the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, which [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=389.64s)]
*  is a very, very important job in the 21st century in the intelligence community. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=395.64s)]
*  So he has this placeholder job right now as chief of staff to Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=401.36s)]
*  So yes, he's a, he had run for Congress. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=405.2s)]
*  He should have won that race given the makeup of that district, but he was kind of too out [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=407.86s)]
*  there even for a district that is a very pro-Trump district. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=412.7s)]
*  And now he's in this role and this is what he's doing with it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=418.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=420.90000000000003s)]
*  Charlie Savage, The New York Times. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  Great reporting. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate you sharing with us. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcRu8H-MME&t=437.86s)]
