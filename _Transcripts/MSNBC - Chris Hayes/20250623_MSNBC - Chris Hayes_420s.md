# 'His intel was the TV': How Fox News influenced Trump's decision to strike Iran
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ)
*  Maybe it's a little early to go there, but this will go down in history as one of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  greatest military victories taking out the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=6.84s)]
*  They have been responsible for hundreds of thousands of missiles between themselves and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=12.52s)]
*  their proxies being fired into Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=16.5s)]
*  They have threatened to wipe Israel and the U.S. off the map, and that threat has been [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=18.94s)]
*  removed tonight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=23.8s)]
*  That was Fox's Sean Hannity on Saturday night. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=24.8s)]
*  Congratulations to Donald Trump for doing exactly what Hannity and most of the other [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=27.76s)]
*  anchors on Fox wanted him to do, bomb Iran. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=31.44s)]
*  In fact, Fox may have helped convince Trump to attack. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=34.24s)]
*  According to the New York Times, Trump ultimately decided to strike Iran for a couple reasons, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  but here's a big one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=42.08s)]
*  Quote, the president was closely monitoring Fox News, which was airing wall-to-wall praise [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=43.08s)]
*  of Israel's military operation and featuring guests urging Mr. Trump to get more involved. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=48.24s)]
*  Liam Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent at the New York Times. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  She's one of five reporters on that story about Trump's evolution on striking Iran, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=55.36s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=59.76s)]
*  Liam, it's great to have you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=60.76s)]
*  I was struck by two things. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=62.48s)]
*  One, the first statement from any U.S. official after the Israeli strike started from Marco [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=65.16s)]
*  Rubio State Department was very distancing, extremely distancing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=71.06s)]
*  And then the real change, first in the tone and then in the actions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=76.52s)]
*  Give us what your reporting says about that trajectory. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=82.72s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=86.16s)]
*  We all know, and you know very well, that Donald Trump has prided himself on being a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  non-interventionist. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=96.24s)]
*  He pledged during his campaign that he was not going to get the United States involved [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=97.24s)]
*  in any more forever wars. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=102.94s)]
*  He thought they were stupid. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=105.12s)]
*  He's long been one of those people who did not want. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=106.56s)]
*  He's very much of the America first category. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  And that was what we saw in the first day of the Israeli campaign. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=116.8s)]
*  As you mentioned, the Marco Rubio statement and the administration and the Trump White [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  House made clear that the United States had nothing to do with it and was not taking part [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=127.28s)]
*  in the offensive operations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=132.76s)]
*  But then there started to be a shift. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  And that shift happened pretty early on. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  One official told me that it happened, it started as early as the next morning when [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=143.4s)]
*  President Trump woke up and watched Fox News and started to see how well Israel was being [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=148.04s)]
*  presented as doing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=156.44s)]
*  Israel was hitting all of these Iranian strikes, Iranian sites. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=158.3s)]
*  It was taking out military commanders, nuclear scientists. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=164.32s)]
*  And that was being presented on Fox as this huge victory. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=168.4s)]
*  And Israel was doing, doing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=172.56s)]
*  And then there was that quote from the German chancellor who said that Israel was doing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=174.76s)]
*  everybody's dirty work for them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  But this coverage, and Trump started to see this as Israel looking strong and going really [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=182.04s)]
*  well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=188.52s)]
*  And he decided that he wanted a piece of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=189.52s)]
*  He wanted to take part. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=191.8s)]
*  And that's where we saw that shift started, where Donald Trump started to take credit [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  for stuff that the United States had not been taking part in. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=198.36s)]
*  He said that the U.S. had, he said we had complete air control. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=202.24s)]
*  We had established air superiority over Iran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  That's not us, it's Israel, unless you think the United States is Israel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  And he started making threats about Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  He came back early from that G7 meeting and called his advisors, his national security [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  advisors to meet with him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=228.96s)]
*  And by then he had pretty much decided that he wanted to get his piece, get in on the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=230.72000000000003s)]
*  action. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=238.36s)]
*  He decided that he liked the idea of this bunker buster bomb, the GBU-57, which is a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=239.36s)]
*  massive ordnance penetrator, is the formal name for it, that hasn't been used in combat [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  before. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=254.56s)]
*  But if you recall, in Afghanistan, I think it was 2017 or 2018 when Trump ordered that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=255.56s)]
*  the military drop the MOHA, which is that really big bomb that basically bombed a whole [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  bunch of tunnels and hills, but it didn't kill a lot of insurgents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=270.12s)]
*  He likes that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=275.86s)]
*  He likes that big, the big show, the big idea of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=276.86s)]
*  And he liked the idea that this was something that only the United States had, according [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=281.3s)]
*  to our officials. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=285.54s)]
*  He ordered up the strikes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=286.54s)]
*  But the interesting part about it is he telegraphed so much of this on media. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  Can I read? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=297.3s)]
*  I want to read, I just want to read this portion. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=298.3s)]
*  Even as military planning was being conducted in secrecy, each of Mr. Trump's social media [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=301.18s)]
*  posts seemed to be telling the world what was coming. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=305.02s)]
*  The president said one military official was the biggest threat to OPSEC. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=307.46s)]
*  To build confusion to the attack plan, military officials decided to have two groups of B-2 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  bombers leave Missouri around the same time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  So the Pentagon, a Pentagon, one military official was very, very, who said to me, he [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=320.18s)]
*  was very, very frustrated. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=326.32s)]
*  This was before I knew that there were going to be attacks. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  I remember on the phone with him and he's like, the president is the biggest threat [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=332.3s)]
*  to OPSEC that we have every time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  Even if we were going to do something, he's putting it all out there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=338.86s)]
*  That's not what you do when you're about to order up a strike. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=342.38s)]
*  A lot of this was playing out, as we saw on social media in one minute. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=346.5s)]
*  And then Trump got, one minute Trump would say Tehran should evacuate, the next minute [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=352.02s)]
*  he would say, nobody knows what he's going to do. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  He looked, he seemed to be all over the place, but he was definitely giving, forecasting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  very much what the U.S. was about to do. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=368.5s)]
*  So the Pentagon had to do misdirect. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  They had to end up coming up with that statement in which Caroline Levitt said he's going [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=374.42s)]
*  to decide in two weeks. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=379.18s)]
*  And they had to send B-2 bombers towards Guam to sort of call attention away from the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  main strike package that was headed east. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  Haleem Cooper at the New York Times. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=390.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for sharing your reporting. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=391.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw9soeWkPvQ&t=393.02s)]
