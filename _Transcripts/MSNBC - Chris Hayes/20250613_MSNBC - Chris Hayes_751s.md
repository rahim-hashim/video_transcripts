# ‘Coast to coast’: Millions set to rally against Trump at 'No Kings' protests
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and thank you for joining us on a very, very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=0.0s)]
*  busy Friday. We're covering a whole bunch of developing stories, including the escalating [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=4.32s)]
*  conflict between Israel and Iran that began, or at least this round of it began, 24 hours [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=8.58s)]
*  ago when Israel launched those military strikes against the capital city of Tehran, targeting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=14.1s)]
*  both nuclear and military infrastructure, as well as key leaders, the armed forces, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=18.88s)]
*  residential homes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=24.12s)]
*  Iran then retaliated earlier today, starting around 9 p.m. local time in Tel Aviv. The [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=26.16s)]
*  United States helped Israel defend against those strikes, so now we have apparently been [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=31.68s)]
*  pulled into yet another war in the Middle East, which really does seem to me to amount [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=36.4s)]
*  to another broken promise from the Trump administration, which quite clearly campaigned on that not [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=41.4s)]
*  happening. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  I'm going to have much more on this story a little later in the hour. We begin tonight [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  with what's happening here in the United States on American streets, where resistance and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=51.04s)]
*  protests and public opinion and politics, all of that still matter. Across many, many [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  different fronts today, the country is locked in a kind of arm wrestle between Donald Trump's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  desire to subjugate the country under his rule and the people's desire to not be governed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  unilaterally by a king. This conflict, of course, perhaps most pronounced in Los Angeles, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=71.5s)]
*  where Trump has deployed the National Guard against the wishes of the state Democratic [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=77.08s)]
*  governor. The use of National Guard members was actually struck down by a district court [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=80.84s)]
*  judge yesterday, although they remain in L.A. pending an appeal. As of today, you've also [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=85.42s)]
*  got 200 Marines that have been deployed into California, which is an enormous escalation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=90.24s)]
*  It shouldn't be conflated with the National Guard presence. We don't have Marines on U.S. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=94.8s)]
*  streets, even under normal conditions of civil unrest. According to Reuters, those Marines [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=98.6s)]
*  already detained at least one person at the federal building. They have been directed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  to protect. And in fact, Reuters reporting the man that you see there, get this ready, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=111.32s)]
*  he's a veteran who is going to a appointment at the Department of Veterans Affairs and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  accidentally crossed a yellow line. This overreach extends far beyond the troops in L.A. Today, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=121.44s)]
*  the Trump administration said it would not release recent Columbia graduate student Mahmoud [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  Khalil, a legal resident, a green heart card holder who has not been charged with any [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=131.52s)]
*  crime. You may remember he was snatched from his home in front of his then nine month pregnant [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  wife. He's been imprisoned for three months over his protective political speech protesting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza. Trump's Department of Justice said it would not release Khalil even [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  after a federal judge determined he cannot be deported or detained under the reasoning [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  initially provided by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which is that Khalil's very presence [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=158.72s)]
*  in the country poses a national security threat. So the government now is saying he's being [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=163.72s)]
*  held for a different reason, related to some discrepancy in his green card application [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=169.2s)]
*  which the same judge declined to block thus far. Now, let's be clear here, right? Mahmoud [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=175.88s)]
*  Khalil was not arrested and detained over a paperwork dispute. We're talking about the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=180.64s)]
*  same administration that had federal agents manhandle a United States Senator, forced him to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=185.72s)]
*  the ground and handcuffed him after he tried to ask a question at a press conference held by Trump's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=191.44s)]
*  Homeland Security Director, Kristi Noem. The press conference, by the way, where Noem admitted that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=196.36s)]
*  the military president's presence in Los Angeles was explicitly for political and ideological [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=201.6s)]
*  purposes. She said to liberate them from the socialist governing class there. This is also [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=207.8s)]
*  the same government that tried to forcibly prevent a United States congresswoman from exercising [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=215.24s)]
*  basic and legally protected oversight and an ICE detention facility in her district. Again, all in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=219.8s)]
*  front of witnesses, all in front of cameras, they then charged the same congresswoman with federal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=225.16s)]
*  crimes for her troubles. But as this administration has seen, as we are seeing, people are not just [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=229.8s)]
*  going to roll over and let the country devolve into an authoritarian state. We are seeing this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=236.8s)]
*  inherent conflict, what has been the story of Trump 2.0 so far, to my mind, come to a head tomorrow, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  in fact. Donald Trump is holding a North Korean-style military parade, Soviet-style military parade [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  through the nation's capital, something that we just don't do as a country. The last one we did [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=256.12s)]
*  was after the first Persian Gulf War, which was celebrating the end of a war. We don't have that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  here. It just so happens to fall on his 79th birthday. He's even fundraising from it, if you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=265.48s)]
*  could believe it. Well, you can, of course. Sending out this email with the subject line, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=271.56s)]
*  quote, please help me before my military parade. I'm sorry, that's a funny sentence, my military [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=275.64s)]
*  parade. And of course, Donald Trump has already promised, quote, very heavy force against anyone [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=282.52s)]
*  who would choose to protest his special day. He didn't direct this at rioters or looters or [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=289.08s)]
*  people that broke the law. He said protesters would be met with very heavy force. And so it's [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=294.44s)]
*  not surprising that in places like, say, Florida, officials are out there talking like this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=300.36s)]
*  If you throw a brick, a firebomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=305.64s)]
*  we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=310.2s)]
*  because we will kill you graveyard dead. We're not going to play. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=314.2s)]
*  If somebody's in front of you and they're threatening your vehicle, you just drive. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=318.12s)]
*  Regardless of the threats, there will be enormous peaceful protests tomorrow, all across the country, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=324.04s)]
*  in fact, from coast to coast. There will even be a few international protests and solidarity against [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=329.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's desire to rule like a king. In fact, we've been seeing a lot of protests against [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump lately. And you might not know this if you watch the news, right? Rit large. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=340.2s)]
*  There's this organization called Waging Nonviolence that actually tracks this. And [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  it's a very scrupulous accounting. I got to say, I know the people that do it. They're academics. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=350.28s)]
*  They're serious folks, right? So look at the blue line on the top. Those are organized nonviolent [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=354.12s)]
*  protests in 2025. They are far outpacing the same metric during Trump's first term. That's the green [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=359.0s)]
*  line on the bottom. More mass mobilization happening. Anecdotally, we are seeing report [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=367.08s)]
*  after report after report. I mean, truly dozens a day I come across showing that regular people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=372.92s)]
*  of all kinds of different politics and ideologies, even people who voted for Trump, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=379.64s)]
*  are just not happy about his indiscriminate mass deportation scheme. Voters may support [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=383.88s)]
*  deporting those who have committed serious crimes. The polling would indicate that that's true. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=391.24s)]
*  What is clear they do not support is deporting friends and family members and their neighbors [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=395.48s)]
*  and their co-workers and chasing people through strawberry fields and their employees. People who [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=401.8s)]
*  in many cases have lived here for years. In one case, an individual I saw today, he's been here [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=407.8s)]
*  30 years. Got kids and grandkids. And again, this is in conjecture. Polling, bearing this out. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=411.24s)]
*  Earlier this week, Quinnipiac released a poll showing Trump underwater by double digits on both [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=416.92s)]
*  immigration issues and deportations specifically. Today, a new Reuters poll showing much the same. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  Voters by a margin of nine points think Trump has gone too far with his deportations. They [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=428.92s)]
*  disapprove of the government arresting local officials who interfere in immigration enforcement [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=434.12s)]
*  by 14 points. They disapprove of how Trump has handled the Los Angeles protests by 15 points. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=438.52s)]
*  Which is to say, it often doesn't feel like it, but the mass mobilization against Donald Trump [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  is working. What this government is doing is unpopular with broad swaths of Americans. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  And the more people draw attention to it, the more unpopular it becomes. Time and time again, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  we've seen the people and courts and some key institutions force Trump to retreat. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=464.2s)]
*  Here's an example. Kilmar Brego Garcia is back in the United States. He's released from that mega [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=472.12s)]
*  prison in El Salvador, shipped off with no due process whatsoever. Even after the Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=476.92s)]
*  administration insisted multiple times that would never happen. He's never coming back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  Today, after months in protest, he got a day in court, the US court, where he pleaded not guilty [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=486.36s)]
*  to the charges this DOJ brought against him, and he will be able to enjoy due process as he is [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=491.32s)]
*  entitled to. In Washington, we got word that Senate Republicans have altered a portion [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=496.76s)]
*  of Trump's bill there that would have limited the court's ability to rein him in. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=502.44s)]
*  They did so after folks across the country from Nebraska to Iowa showed up to town halls [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=507.08s)]
*  to tell the representatives about that provision the House put in. No way. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=512.04s)]
*  It's going to require this kind of democratic force and mobilization against the Trump [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=515.16s)]
*  administration constantly. And believe me, I know it is exhausting. This is year 10 that I'm covering [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  him. But there will be a million more small victories along the way. Starting tomorrow, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=531.24s)]
*  when regular folks across the country in small towns and big cities and everything in between [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=536.92s)]
*  organize with a simple message, no kings, not ever. Lorella Praley is the co-president of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  Organization Community Change. It's one of the leaders of this weekend's No Kings demonstration. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=548.6s)]
*  She's been very active in the planning. Michelle Goldberg is, of course, my good friend and opinion [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=552.2s)]
*  columnist from New York Times, where she writes, today, progressives need a global movement, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=556.84s)]
*  and they joined me now. It's good to have you both here. Thank you. Lorella, just tell me a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=560.52s)]
*  little bit about what the organizers for tomorrow's protests are envisioning, what you're hearing, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  what the amount of reaction looks like. I think we're expecting protests all over the country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=568.92s)]
*  You saw the map, small towns, rural America in big cities. And I think what we're seeing is people [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=575.64s)]
*  saying enough. No kings in the United States of America. And all of these protests are happening [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=581.9599999999999s)]
*  on the heels of an escalating few weeks where they are overreaching. They are full force in elementary [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=587.0s)]
*  schools, at home depots, now also reportedly today going to parks, picking up nannies and the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=595.16s)]
*  kids that they are taking care of to depore undocumented people. But actually what we're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=600.76s)]
*  seeing across this country is them targeting anyone who looks like me, anyone who is Latino or brown [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=605.88s)]
*  and beyond in this moment. And so I think what we're going to see tomorrow is people saying that is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  not who we are. They're going to stand up, push back. And that's the kind of thing we need because [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=616.52s)]
*  no one is coming to save us. In an authoritarian breakthrough, the only backstop is us, the people. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=621.96s)]
*  And that's what you're going to see tomorrow. You know, one of the things that they do in their [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzKIHfCTaLk&t=629.32s)]
