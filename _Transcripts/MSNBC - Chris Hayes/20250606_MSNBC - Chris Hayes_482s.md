# 'The girls are fighting!': AOC reacts to Trump-Musk feud
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA World is still reeling from the ongoing breakup [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=2.0s)]
*  between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=5.0s)]
*  Notably, some of their biggest fans are just struggling [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=7.0s)]
*  to accept that this is really the end. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=11.0s)]
*  I think it's incredibly unfortunate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=14.0s)]
*  You and I are both good friends with President Trump, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=16.0s)]
*  and we're both good friends with Elon Musk. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=18.0s)]
*  They're both extraordinary men. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=20.0s)]
*  I hope that both of them come back together, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=22.0s)]
*  because when the two of them are working together, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=25.0s)]
*  we'll get a lot more done for America than when they're at cross purposes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=27.0s)]
*  I think it is important for us to pray for peace and the unification of these two guys, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=31.0s)]
*  because as Bill Ackman said and you've said yourself, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=37.0s)]
*  the country's in a lot better spot when those two are united. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=40.0s)]
*  For his part, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=45.0s)]
*  invoked his wife's desire to see the two men reconcile. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=48.0s)]
*  I just heard Barbara Grassley say this disagreement and arguments [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=51.0s)]
*  between Musk and Trump must end. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=54.0s)]
*  I know she loves both Musk and President Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=56.0s)]
*  I'd advise you to follow her advice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=59.0s)]
*  And Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah has been openly pleading [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=61.0s)]
*  with both men to end their feud, tweeting, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=65.0s)]
*  Who else really wants Elon Musk and real Donald Trump to reconcile? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=67.0s)]
*  Repost if you agree the world is a better place [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=72.0s)]
*  with the Trump-Musk bromance fully intact. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=75.0s)]
*  He even shared this photoshopped image, which is pretty funny, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=79.0s)]
*  of Trump and Musk as a married couple with the caption, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=82.0s)]
*  I never got over my parents' divorce. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=85.0s)]
*  Now, unfortunately for the Senator, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=88.0s)]
*  it doesn't seem like reconciliation is in the cards, at least not today, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=90.0s)]
*  not right now, and the maga roll is slowly coming to terms [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=93.0s)]
*  with the fact that they're going to need to pick sides. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=96.0s)]
*  In fact, Musk is forcing the question. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=99.0s)]
*  After reviewing the results of a very unscientific poll [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=102.0s)]
*  on his own social media platform, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=105.0s)]
*  the billionaire is now calling for a third party [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=107.0s)]
*  following his split from the Republicans, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=110.0s)]
*  quote, The people have spoken. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=112.0s)]
*  A new political party is needed in America [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=114.0s)]
*  to represent the 80% in the middle. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=116.0s)]
*  And exactly 80% of people agree, smiley emoji, this is fate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=118.0s)]
*  God, he's just got a knack for posting, doesn't he? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=122.0s)]
*  Adding it will be called the America Party. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=125.0s)]
*  Not sure how many takers Musk is going to get on that offer, though. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=128.0s)]
*  Most of his old Republican allies seem to be siding [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=132.0s)]
*  with the sitting president of the United States, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=135.0s)]
*  including Trump's buddies on the Fox and Friends curvy couch. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=137.0s)]
*  The Epstein file thing was way over the top [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=141.0s)]
*  and just crazy to say that Trump was in the Epstein files. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=144.0s)]
*  I mean, what are you doing? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=149.0s)]
*  I mean, sometimes when people get drunk, they do crazy things, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=151.0s)]
*  but this is a total escalation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=155.0s)]
*  We're going to have more to say about the Epstein part of this, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=159.0s)]
*  in fact, a lot more later in the show, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=162.0s)]
*  but I guess welcome to the resistance, Fox and Friends, kind of. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=164.0s)]
*  I mean, that kind of recklessness on display by Elon Musk yesterday [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=168.0s)]
*  is identical to the recklessness he's been displaying [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=174.0s)]
*  every day for the last year that we have been warning about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=177.0s)]
*  since Donald Trump handed him a chainsaw [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=181.0s)]
*  and let him loose on the federal bureaucracy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=184.0s)]
*  and then just a few days ago literally handed him a key to the government. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=186.0s)]
*  And of course, all of this reflects incredibly poorly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=191.0s)]
*  on the president of the United States. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=194.0s)]
*  And so desperate for some sort of salvaging party line, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=196.0s)]
*  Naga World today kind of, or yesterday, today, want us to all think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=200.0s)]
*  the takeaway here is that president is taking a page from Michelle Obama. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=205.0s)]
*  When Elon goes low, Trump goes high. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=210.0s)]
*  But I give Trump so much credit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=213.0s)]
*  For the most part, he's measured, wants to be here, appreciate what he did. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=215.0s)]
*  When the EV mandate was eliminated, he's not happy about it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=219.0s)]
*  He says foundationally he doesn't like the bill. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=223.0s)]
*  You know what? The bill might actually get better because of Musk. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=226.0s)]
*  And I think we're working towards that right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=229.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, and I know it sounds crazy, he just doesn't understand politics. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=231.0s)]
*  He has no idea about compromise. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=235.0s)]
*  That measured response is mostly just Trump venting to TV journalists [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=237.0s)]
*  about Musk over the phone instead of posting about him in all caps on social media. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=241.0s)]
*  Today, Trump told ABC News Musk lost his mind. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=245.0s)]
*  He told Fox News Elon's totally lost it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=248.0s)]
*  He told CNN the poor guy's got a problem. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=250.0s)]
*  But lest you think, Trump isn't acting restrained. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=253.0s)]
*  He also told CBS News he's not focused on Musk. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=256.0s)]
*  And despite Trump's apparent willingness to speak to any journalist on the cell phone, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=260.0s)]
*  his own vice president, Jay D. Vance, is blaming those same journalists [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=265.0s)]
*  for reporting the things Trump tells him on the record. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=269.0s)]
*  Quote, there are many lies the corporate media tells about President Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=272.0s)]
*  One of the most glaring is that he's impulsive or short-tempered. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=276.0s)]
*  Anyone who has seen him operate under pressure knows that's ridiculous. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=279.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=283.0s)]
*  Whatever you say, it's probably worth keeping in mind that when Trump did post [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=285.0s)]
*  about the feud on social media, oh, when was it? Oh, yesterday. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=288.0s)]
*  It was to threaten to end billions of dollars in federal contracts [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=292.0s)]
*  the US government has with Musk. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=297.0s)]
*  So I guess you can now acknowledge that those contracts are wasteful, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=299.0s)]
*  and they were pork and cronyism, and they only existed [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=302.0s)]
*  because Musk was his buddy, or they're not, and he's going to get rid of them [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=305.0s)]
*  purely out of vengeance? That's restraint, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=309.0s)]
*  Despite Trump's so-called measured response, his feud is still causing problems [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=313.0s)]
*  across MAGA world. This is really amazing. Check this out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=317.0s)]
*  It has gotten so bad that the FBI director, Cash Patel, who, of course, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=321.0s)]
*  had a big interview with Joe Rogan, had his interview interrupted with the breaking news. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=325.0s)]
*  This is going to come up because it's been going on since we've been recording here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=332.0s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=336.0s)]
*  Elon and Trump seem to be in a little bit of a spat, Joe. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=337.0s)]
*  You want to check the tweet that Elon just put out a little bit ago? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=340.0s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=343.0s)]
*  That's the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day. Jesus Christ. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=347.0s)]
*  I'm not participating in any of that conversation between Elon and Trump. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=352.0s)]
*  What is he? Have a nice day? DGD? So much diggits falling away. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=356.0s)]
*  Does he know that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files? Does he have access to the Epstein files? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=359.0s)]
*  I don't know how he would, but I'm just staying out of the Trump-Elon thing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=363.0s)]
*  So the FBI director is staying out of the Trump-Elon thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=367.0s)]
*  He's staying out of an accusation that Donald Trump is in a secret file [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=370.0s)]
*  linking him to Jeffrey Epstein that the FBI is possession of. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=375.0s)]
*  On the other hand, when Joe Rogan, of all people, thinks you got off the deep end [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=379.0s)]
*  and someone should take away your phone, it's probably time to log off for a little while. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=382.0s)]
*  But Musk's prolonged crash out is still going on. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=386.0s)]
*  He's been something on a tear. He's been tweeting slurs at Trump's informant advisor, Steve Bannon, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=389.0s)]
*  who's been a very vocal Musk critic, who wants the world's richest man deported. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=394.0s)]
*  I do believe, I strongly believe, that he's here illegally, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=399.0s)]
*  that he lied on all his applications and visas, and that if that's the case, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=405.0s)]
*  he has to be deported immediately. You cannot deport 13 million people, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=410.0s)]
*  particularly many people from the Third World, and let some billionaire get away with that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=414.0s)]
*  So I'm very strongly for that he should be deported if it turns out that he did these things inappropriately, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=419.0s)]
*  which I strongly believe we'll find out, but that is for people to actually investigate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=426.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure Elon Musk would reject that characterization of his immigration status, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=430.0s)]
*  but all things considered, I think Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez might have summed it up best. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=435.0s)]
*  Any quick reaction on what's going on with Elon Musk and President Trump on Twitter right now? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=441.0s)]
*  Oh man, the girls are fighting, aren't they? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=446.0s)]
*  You know, I would say that this was something that was a long time coming. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=449.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4H_brKkeTk&t=470.0s)]
