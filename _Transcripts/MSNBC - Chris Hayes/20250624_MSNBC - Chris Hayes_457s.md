*  Barranco, an undocumented father of three U.S. Marines with no known criminal history, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=9.84s)]
*  was approached by masked agents while working as a landscaper outside an IHOP. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security says Barranco assaulted officers with a weed whacker, and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=20.26s)]
*  eyewitness the IHOP manager says that's not true. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=24.44s)]
*  Now Barranco's son Alejandro, a Marine veteran, is trying to raise awareness for his father's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=28.12s)]
*  case and Alejandro Barranco joins me now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=32.4s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining me tonight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=37.0s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=39.0s)]
*  And I want to start by asking if you've had a chance to talk to your father recently and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=40.0s)]
*  do you know how he's doing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=45.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I talked to him earlier today, a couple hours ago. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=47.0s)]
*  I saw him for the first time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=51.92s)]
*  He looks beat up. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=54.32s)]
*  He looks sad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=56.28s)]
*  He looks defeated. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=57.44s)]
*  He's still in the same clothes as he was when they picked him up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=61.08s)]
*  There appears to be blood on his shirt. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=65.88s)]
*  His shoulder is still hurting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  He said he's massaged it himself but hasn't obviously received medical treatment for it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=71.6s)]
*  His eyes still burn. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=75.64s)]
*  He's just in pain and he's honestly really, really sad. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=77.64s)]
*  How old is your father? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  He's 48 years old. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=85.44s)]
*  How long has he lived in this country? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Since the 90s, most of his life. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=91.64s)]
*  What kind of man is he? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=97.44s)]
*  What do you want people to know about him? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=98.44s)]
*  Obviously there was a lot of talk in the campaign about immigrants who are threats to Americans, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=101.56s)]
*  who are criminals and predators and dangerous. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=108.12s)]
*  And I'm curious what you would want people to know about the kind of man your dad is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=111.04s)]
*  Yeah, he's just a hardworking guy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=115.72s)]
*  He's a kind guy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=118.04s)]
*  He's always been very helpful. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=120.88s)]
*  He doesn't have any criminal record. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=125.28s)]
*  He's not a threat to our community. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=129.24s)]
*  He actually helps our community. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=132.72s)]
*  He has a school of Marines. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=135.72s)]
*  He always educated us well and taught us to be patriots, taught us to love our country, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=137.8s)]
*  to give back. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=143.52s)]
*  It's not at all what they're describing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  How did you find out about his detention and what was your thought when you heard about it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=149.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I received a phone call from a Los Angeles number on Saturday at around 11 a.m. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=154.44s)]
*  I didn't answer, I don't usually answer those calls. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=161.52s)]
*  I saw the voicemail that came in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=165.08s)]
*  I listened to it immediately and it was my dad. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=167.0s)]
*  They sounded like they're telling him, speak, speak. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=169.36s)]
*  He just told me, hey, I got picked up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=173.56s)]
*  Can you and your brothers please go pick up my truck? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=176.56s)]
*  And he said, I left my wallet, my phone. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=180.56s)]
*  He's like, I don't have any way to communicate to you guys. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=182.56s)]
*  Have you talked to your brothers and do you have a kind of sense of what your family can do to, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=186.56s)]
*  at the very least, get him out of detention? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=191.56s)]
*  Yeah, so we're currently filing, finishing filing his parole in place because it was something [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=195.56s)]
*  that we reached out to an attorney about. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=203.08s)]
*  It was just hard to find the time to do all that type of stuff, both my brother being [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=205.08s)]
*  active duty and him working all day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=208.08s)]
*  But yeah, what we're trying to do right now is finishing that and then hopefully get him out on bail. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=212.08s)]
*  So we just want him home. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=219.08s)]
*  Am I right that your brothers are at Camp Pendleton in California? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=223.08s)]
*  Yes, yes, they're at Camp Pendleton. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=228.08s)]
*  So you're not 100% sure about that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  I do know that there's some from 29 palms. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure if they're all from Camp Pendleton or all from 29 palms. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  As someone who served this country, whose brothers are currently in active duty and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  whose I think household clearly kind of inculcated a sense of patriotism and service in the three [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  sons. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=254.12s)]
*  What do you feel about your government doing this to your dad? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=256.12s)]
*  I mean, those are federal officials. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=259.12s)]
*  Those are people employed by our government that wrestled your dad to the ground and hit [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=261.12s)]
*  him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=266.12s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't think it's right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=268.12s)]
*  I don't think it's professional at all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=270.12s)]
*  I feel hurt. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=273.12s)]
*  My heart's broken. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=275.12s)]
*  I love my country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=278.12s)]
*  I love my dad. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=279.12s)]
*  I love my family. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=280.12s)]
*  I love the community. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=281.12s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=282.64s)]
*  I do feel betrayed at times. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=283.64s)]
*  Have you talked to your brothers about this? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=286.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=289.64s)]
*  They're also mad. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=290.64s)]
*  They're sad about the situation and they wish they could do more right now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=291.64s)]
*  If you could have a conversation with the President of the United States, if he were [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=297.64s)]
*  to invite you to the Oval Office, you got to sit with him, what would you say to him? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=304.64s)]
*  I would love for him to understand where we're coming from, to understand people like my [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  parents, to understand the very hardworking people in this country that come undocumented [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  but they're not here to cause problems. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  They're here to help us out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  They're here to help the country out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  They're here to give their kids, to raise their kids well, to respect this country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  And just like myself and my brothers served in law enforcement, military, they're here [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  to help us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  They're here to help us out in the military, in the law enforcement, military, whatever [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=337.68s)]
*  way is possible. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=340.68s)]
*  Why do you think we've gotten to this point? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=343.68s)]
*  You've grown up in a community, I imagine your dad has been working, I think he works [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=347.68s)]
*  seven days a week. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=352.68s)]
*  It sounds like he's cherished and really liked and depended on and counted on. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=354.68s)]
*  You clearly have a stable home. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=359.68s)]
*  Did you feel worried about this ever happening to your parents? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=363.2s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=370.2s)]
*  Not in the sense that we felt in the last couple months. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=371.2s)]
*  We knew it could happen but we didn't really expect anything like this to happen. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=379.2s)]
*  We did prepare my dad and my mom for this type of situation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=385.2s)]
*  But just the fact and the way that these guys handled it, we prepared my dad where guys [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  were becoming him in masks and submitting photos with guns out and attacking him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  You and your two brothers were born here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  Your dad has been here for almost 30 years, somewhere around there? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think everyone watching this is really hoping that at the very least he can get out [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  of ICE detention. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=418.24s)]
*  We're going to continue to follow your story and I really appreciate you taking some time, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=419.24s)]
*  Alejandro. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=423.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=424.24s)]
*  Of course, thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=425.24s)]
*  Alejandro Barranco, his dad currently in ICE detention in Los Angeles. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=426.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhAqzrgS7QA&t=448.22s)]
