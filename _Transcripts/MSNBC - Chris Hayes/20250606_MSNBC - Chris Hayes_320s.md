# 'Massive': Los Angeles protests erupt over 'worst fear' ICE raids
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI)
*  Trump immigration authorities launched a series of target raids throughout the city of Los Angeles today and tonight a massive protest is taking place [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=0.0s)]
*  outside the LA headquarters of ice [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=7.96s)]
*  NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff is there and he joins us now Jacob [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=10.84s)]
*  I just gotten a text breaking news notification in New York Times about this protest which seems to be quite large. What's going on? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=16.72s)]
*  Let me show you Chris. So these are two protests converging at the same time here. I want to show you this one [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=24.48s)]
*  That's coming from the Metropolitan Detention Center [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=29.48s)]
*  Which is the jail that is run by the federal government the county and the federal government downtown in downtown LA. It's converging with this protest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  It's coming over here Scott Killian. Why don't you walk with me Chris? What happened here today in Los Angeles? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I think is the worst nightmare for so many people who live here [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  You know Los Angeles is a largely so-called minority majority city. There are just as many people of color here as there are white people [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=48.48s)]
*  In fact, 10% of the population of Los Angeles County, Camalee, which is one of the largest counties the largest by population in the United States is undocumented [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=57.48s)]
*  There could be as many as 1 million undocumented people who live here in Los Angeles [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  And what you saw today and what all of these people are protesting is large-scale immigration enforcement raids [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=72.48s)]
*  What you're looking at on the left hand side of your screen is this protest from the sky. The helicopters are directly above me [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=79.48s)]
*  I'm sorry for the noise but you saw tactical officers on things like bear cat vehicles, flash bang grenades on the city streets of Los Angeles [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=85.48s)]
*  Which largely felt like as some people described in local media that the military was on the streets of Los Angeles [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=96.48s)]
*  Historically the Los Angeles Police Department does not cooperate with immigration enforcement efforts [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=103.48s)]
*  The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department does not cooperate with immigration enforcement efforts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=110.48s)]
*  But when you have got ICE in Los Angeles showing up reportedly at Home Depot where many undocumented people go to get work as day laborers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=115.48s)]
*  You know the National Day Laborer Organizing Network well [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=123.48s)]
*  Many of those people responded in the wake of the fires here in Los Angeles [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=126.48s)]
*  When you've got ICE showing up outside of places like schools, it quite literally is striking fear into the heart of people all throughout this community [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  And it is, I think it's fair to say, the worst fear of so many people here who live in Los Angeles and who have heard President Trump threaten that they would do this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  But when this day comes on a Friday morning that stretches into a Friday afternoon, people in Los Angeles are mobilizing and they are very upset [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=150.48s)]
*  You have Shirley here, one of the big NGOs here that fights on behalf of immigrant rights [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=158.48s)]
*  Everybody is out today because obviously this is not to be tolerated by these folks here on the streets of Los Angeles, Chris [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=163.48s)]
*  Yeah, and just to be clear here, my understanding of these raids today, these were just workplace [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=171.48s)]
*  It wasn't like there was some list of people who they suspected were dangerous or guilty of crimes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=176.48s)]
*  These were, we've seen more and more, these basically workplace raids, like show up to a place where people are employed and doing a job and go in, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=182.48s)]
*  That was my understanding of what these raids were today [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=190.48s)]
*  That's exactly right, Chris, one was in the fashion district here just around the corner on Alameda Street, down Alameda Street in downtown Los Angeles [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=194.48s)]
*  Another one of them was basically, if anybody knows, MacArthur Park at a Home Depot near MacArthur Park [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=204.48s)]
*  But the big worry here obviously is these collateral arrests [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=210.48s)]
*  And we have heard statements now from the Los Angeles Unified School District, from the Los Angeles Police Department, from the Mayor of Los Angeles [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=214.48s)]
*  From all, many of the 15 members of the Los Angeles City Council basically condemning these raids because of what they do to the ordinary person in Los Angeles [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=222.48s)]
*  Which is still a massive amount of fear [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=231.48s)]
*  I was talking to a young woman just a few minutes ago who I lost her in the crowd, but her name was Erika Perez [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=234.48s)]
*  She said her mother was just deported earlier in the week after she, Erika Perez, has been a firefighter for Cal Fire responding to some of the wildfires [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=239.48s)]
*  Not here in LA, but in other places across LA [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=248.48s)]
*  The bottom line is undocumented people are in every facet of life here in Los Angeles [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=252.48s)]
*  They are our neighbors, they are our co-workers, they are in our schools [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=257.48s)]
*  And when something like this happens today, look at these signs, I just want to show you real quick [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=261.48s)]
*  Scott, come over here, this is the message and this is what they're worried about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=265.48s)]
*  Get ICE out of our schools and our communities because that is the worst fear, as I said, at the risk of repeating myself [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=269.48s)]
*  Of so many people in the city of Los Angeles [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=277.48s)]
*  Chris, this is like I said, probably in terms of the images and the feelings people are feeling [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=280.48s)]
*  Maybe not reminiscent of a time of many living, young, undocumented people in Los Angeles and very scary for so many of them [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=286.48s)]
*  Thank you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI&t=310.48s)]
