# ‘Called BS’: Trump-appointed judge deals major blow to Trump deportation agenda
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc)
*  Good evening. Welcome back to this super-sized edition of All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has been defying court orders in a way that's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=3.2s)]
*  sort of frustratingly amorphous, but right on the precipice of just a full-blown [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=7.76s)]
*  constitutional crisis. Well, today, a federal court responded to the administration taking [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=14.16s)]
*  the boldest step yet to knock down their illegal renditioning scheme under the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=19.44s)]
*  guide of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Now, that law has only ever been invoked in times of war, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=24.799999999999997s)]
*  real war. I mean, we're talking the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  So to justify using it, the Trump administration claims basically that we are in a situation like [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  those three wars, that we are actively at war with a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Agua, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  which, this is key, the administration falsely claims is an arm of President Nicolas Maduro's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=49.12s)]
*  Venezuelan regime in that country, despite their own internal intelligence insisting otherwise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Now, just to state the obvious, we're not at war in any sense of the word that we understand it, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=64.4s)]
*  legally, with this gang or Venezuela. I mean, everyone knows that, right? Like, if you walked [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=70.88s)]
*  up to people on the street and asked them. But the Trump administration likes to use just [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=75.68s)]
*  almost apocalyptic language to imply otherwise. Have I offered any one of you a rent-free home [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  with no taxes to pay in any of these gang neighborhoods? And I said, your neighbors are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  MS-13 terrorists or Mexican mafia or Sinaloa cartel or Tren de Agua. I couldn't pay you to live [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=93.12s)]
*  there. But yet you, with your coverage, are trying to force innocent Americans to have these people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=99.84s)]
*  as their neighbors and that one day their daughter may be abducted from their home and raped and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=104.96s)]
*  murdered. So you're not going to get an ounce of sympathy from this administration or President [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump for the terrorists who've invaded our homes and our country. Okay, so today, following a lawsuit [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  from the ACLU, a federal judge finally called the administration's bluff and basically rejected the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=119.44s)]
*  fundamental premise of their actions, at least when it comes to the question of the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=126.0s)]
*  In a 36-page ruling, a district judge in Texas named Fernando Rodriguez Jr. told the White House [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=132.72s)]
*  in really no uncertain terms it cannot use the Alien Enemies Act as justification for these [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=139.04s)]
*  renditions, at least when it comes to Venezuelan detainees in his southern district of Texas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=144.0s)]
*  The court concludes that as a matter of law, the executive branch cannot rely on the Alien Enemies [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=150.32s)]
*  Act based on the proclamation to detain the named petitioners in the certified class or remove them [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=156.16s)]
*  from the country. Judge Rodriguez, in his opinion, goes on to call BS basically on the White House's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=161.6s)]
*  argument, quote, the historical record renders clear the president's invocation of the Alien [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=167.44s)]
*  Enemies Act through the proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=172.88s)]
*  ordinary meaning of the statute's terms, adding, as for the activities of the Venezuela-directed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  Trent de Aragua in the United States and as described in the proclamation, the court concludes that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  they do not fall within the plain ordinary meaning of invasion or predatory incursion for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=190.48s)]
*  the purposes of the Alien Enemies Act. In other words, no, we are not at war with Venezuela or [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=196.16s)]
*  Venezuelan gang and they are obviously twisting the meaning of the 1798 statute Alien Enemies Act [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=204.0s)]
*  beyond all recognition to the point where, according to the judge, they are now banned permanently [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  from using it as justification for their renditioning scheme in his district, at least [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=216.8s)]
*  while this ruling stands. By the way, interesting note here, this judge in question, Fernando Rodriguez [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=222.08s)]
*  Jr., he is not some liberal activist. He was appointed to the bench by, drumroll please, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump in 2017. Now, the administration will almost assuredly appeal. The big question is, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=234.08s)]
*  if they will even attempt to obey the order in the meantime or, and this is really high stakes, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=241.76s)]
*  if they will once again openly defy the courts. After all, the administration is not exactly subtle [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=248.16s)]
*  about their willingness to just try to run over the independent judiciary. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=254.32s)]
*  It turns out we've got to do some battle with some really crazy far left judges in order to allow [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=260.8s)]
*  the administration to do what it actually needs to do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=267.76s)]
*  I will say, to great credit, the president expected this. When we came in, he said, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  we're going to start deporting people and a lot of these far left judges are going to stop us [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=275.76s)]
*  and there's no way out of it but through it. We're just going to have to battle. We're going to have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=280.0s)]
*  to win the court cases. We're going to have to take some of this stuff all the way to the Supreme [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=284.0s)]
*  Court and we're going to have to find alternative ways to deport people when the judges say, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=287.44s)]
*  you can't do this method. We're going to have to find another method. So we recognize that we're [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=293.44s)]
*  dealing battle here, doing battle with basically a massive bureaucracy that has decided that it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=297.44s)]
*  rules the country rather than the American people. Again, the far left judges that Vance is talking [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  about, and that's on Tuesday, in this case is a Trump appointed judge and it appears as part of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=309.84s)]
*  the battling that the administration is doing has been just ignoring court orders. I mean, right now, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=316.96s)]
*  the administration is still refusing to facilitate the return of Kilmar or Brego Garcia from her [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=322.0s)]
*  prison in El Salvador even after the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that it must do so. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=328.72s)]
*  We have seen time after time, their strategy is to deport these folks before the courts have time [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=334.8s)]
*  to intervene. Now, sometimes they deport them even after the courts have intervened and instructed [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=339.6s)]
*  them to turn the planes around but sometimes they don't move quite quickly enough. A couple of weeks [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=344.16s)]
*  ago, we were covering this live on the air actually because it was happening in our hour, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=349.6s)]
*  when an 11th hour appeal from the ACLU and a subsequent ruling from the Supreme Court [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  stopped the removal of a bus full of would-be deportees to El Salvador and Venezuela. Those men [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=359.36s)]
*  are now stuck in limbo in a Texas detention facility. Yesterday, they put together this [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=366.0s)]
*  really remarkable signal to the outside world spelling out SOS with their bodies in protest of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=370.88s)]
*  their potential impending removal to a foreign gulag. Reuters actually managed to speak to one [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=376.96s)]
*  of those men, a 19-year-old named Jefferson Escalona. Now, the Trump administration insists [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  that Escalona is a self-admitted member of Trenderagua, although it has not issued any [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=387.84s)]
*  evidence to support that claim. Escalona insists he is not a gang member. He says, in fact, he was [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  a police officer in Venezuela and that the Trump administration's evidence against him appears to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=397.76s)]
*  be photos of him making hand gestures they found on his phone. Escalona fears that he will be sent [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=403.04s)]
*  to that notorious prison in El Salvador. Again, the future of any alien enemies act deportation [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=409.36s)]
*  seems uncertain, but at least for right now, one of Trump's own judges is saying, absolutely not. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  Lee Glernt is the lead lawyer on this case. He's the deputy director of the ACLU Immigrant Rights [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=421.76s)]
*  Project and he joins me now. Lee, let's start with this ruling by this Texas district judge. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=426.16s)]
*  What do you make of it? I think this is a huge first step. You know, Chris, you hit it on the head. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=432.64s)]
*  Two themes that you and I have talked about for years are involved in this case. The first is that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  the Trump administration walked into court and said, we will tell you what the law is. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=445.44s)]
*  You, the federal judge, don't have a role to play in telling us what the law means, what this [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=450.88s)]
*  congressional statute means. The judge said, no, no, no, no, I'm the federal judge. I will tell [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=456.56s)]
*  you what the law means. That's my job. That's critical that the judge put his foot down and said, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=462.8s)]
*  you do not get to decide. You, the executive branch, don't get to decide what the law means and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=468.88s)]
*  then carry it out. The second thing he did is say, look, this is a law Congress passed and these are [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  critical separation of powers issues. The executive branch can't just thrum their nose at what Congress [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=480.32s)]
*  is doing. Congress put very specific guidelines in. And as you pointed out, it says we have to be at [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=486.32s)]
*  war or being invaded by a foreign country or threatened. The judge said under no circumstances [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=492.64s)]
*  are we being invaded by this criminal gang and said, now you cannot use this law again. You know, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  as you said, they're going to, they're going to appeal, but this is a critical first step in what's [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=507.28s)]
*  going to be a long battle. But we hope that the courts will ultimately affirm this. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=511.68s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is going to be appealed to the notoriously right wing fifth circuit, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=516.48s)]
*  which is the circuit there, which is based out of New Orleans and covers, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  covers Texas. It'll I think end up probably before the Supreme court. But the other, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=526.0s)]
*  the other aspect here is the current hold on moving people, which seems so essential here [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=529.76s)]
*  because we've seen what's happened when they're allowed to do it, which is they flew the planes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=537.44s)]
*  They kind of thumbed their nose. And now you've got these individuals there, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=543.28s)]
*  including someone they admit was mistakenly sent their Kilmore or Brieger Garcia. You've got others [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=546.0s)]
*  who I think have pretty strong cases. They're just cases of mistaken identity. Like they're not gang [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=550.0s)]
*  members and they're there no way out. What is the status of this prohibition right now on sending [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=554.16s)]
*  people there? Because it's quite confusing given the kind of patchwork. Yeah, you're exactly right [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=560.08s)]
*  to bring up that issue. So this is what's happening. The Supreme court said you can't do [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=566.08s)]
*  one case. We had originally brought it as one nationwide case in D.C. Supreme court said, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  no, you have to do it in what's called habeas corpus petitions in the district where people [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  are detained. So what's happened is the administration is moving people from district to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=580.0s)]
*  district all over the country, forcing us at the middle of the night sometimes to have to keep [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  filing habeas petitions. So now this judge said you cannot use this act and you cannot transfer [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=590.88s)]
*  people out of the Southern District of Texas. We have an injunction in Colorado, in Pennsylvania, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=596.4799999999999s)]
*  in New York, but we know the administration is going to try and evade judicial review by constantly [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=602.24s)]
*  moving people around. So what we've told people is if you think one of your clients is at risk [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=607.12s)]
*  somewhere in the country, we will file something in that part of the country. And we're just going [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  to have to keep doing it until ultimately the Supreme Court steps in and issues are ruling one [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=618.88s)]
*  way or the other. But that's the problem is rather than the administration saying, okay, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=624.08s)]
*  we'll be orderly and wait for a court ruling, they're just moving people around and trying to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=628.56s)]
*  do it without us noticing. So I don't know off the top of my head if Department of Homeland Security [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=633.52s)]
*  has said something one way or the other in the interest of fairness here about whether they're [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfAv2PiWTuc&t=639.04s)]
