# 'Welcome to the team': Chris Murphy, Maxwell Frost hold town halls where Republicans won't
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc)
*  I'm so proud to be here with you all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=0.0s)]
*  This isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=3.6s)]
*  It's about the people versus the problem. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is the problem. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=8.72s)]
*  Elon Musk is the problem. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=10.84s)]
*  And if you're here and you voted for Trump in the past, my message is simple. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry you were lied to, but welcome to the team. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=19.96s)]
*  Welcome to the team. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=24.12s)]
*  That was Florida Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost speaking to voters in North Carolina's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=26.12s)]
*  9th district. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=30.8s)]
*  Now, Frost does not represent those folks at that town hall. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=31.8s)]
*  The guy that actually got voted into that district is that man you see right there, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=35.52s)]
*  Republican Congressman Richard Hudson. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  He is the one who told Republicans across the country to stop holding in-person town [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=41.2s)]
*  halls after they all started getting tough questions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=47.0s)]
*  So, Congressman Frost, along with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, showed up instead, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=49.92s)]
*  along with nearly 800 constituents, and listened to questions from folks in Congressman Hudson's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=54.8s)]
*  district. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  The reason that your Congressman isn't here, the reason that he is hiding, is because he [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=61.76s)]
*  doesn't represent you, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=67.8s)]
*  He believes that the only people who matter in this country are the billionaire class. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  And Senator Chris Murphy, Democratic of Connecticut, and Congressman Maxwell Frost, Democrat of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Florida, joined me now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=82.0s)]
*  Good to have you, gentlemen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  Senator, I'll start with you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  Just tell me about why do this event and what was it like? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=86.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was a crazy crowd. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=90.0s)]
*  Standing room only. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  There was overflow outside. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  We were limited only by the capacity of the venue. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  But listen, I mean, this is a national fight, and Republicans think that they can get away [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=99.76s)]
*  with this thievery, this corruption, this destruction of democracy by hiding. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=103.44s)]
*  We have some really important votes coming before the Senate and the House this summer. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=108.68s)]
*  Republicans are planning to vote on this bill that would throw millions of people off their [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  health care, including lots of them here in North Carolina, in order to fund a tax cut [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=116.44s)]
*  for the billionaire class, people who don't need it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  And Republicans are kind of hoping that in their backyard, their constituents won't hear [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=124.68s)]
*  about the truth, because they're refusing to hold town halls. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  So Maxwell and I are committed this spring and this summer to be all over the country [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=133.24s)]
*  and hold town halls where Republicans won't. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=137.72s)]
*  We only need to convince three or four Republicans in the House and the Senate to vote no against [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  these cuts to save a lot of lives. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=144.84s)]
*  Maybe we can find one here in North Carolina or one tomorrow in Missouri. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  That's our job, to bring this fight all across the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=150.88s)]
*  Congressman, I liked what you said there about, you know, if you voted for Trump, sorry you're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  lied if you're welcome to the team, because it seems to me that, you know, we're seeing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=157.72s)]
*  erosion in his numbers and for, you know, the public to turn against him at the scale [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=163.24s)]
*  that would be necessary to stop the harm that is being engineered, you're going to need [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  folks that voted for Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=176.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  This movement and to win, we're going to have to be about addition, not subtraction. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  So it's not about telling people, I told you so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=184.88s)]
*  It's not about shaming people for making a decision we disagree with, but it's about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=188.12s)]
*  saying I'm sorry you were lied to. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=192.4s)]
*  This is why you've been lied to. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=194.4s)]
*  This is what Trump is doing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Taking away health care, taking away the things that working families have earned in order [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=197.16s)]
*  to give billionaires and mega corporations a tax cut. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=201.56s)]
*  And then we can't stop there because it's not just about defending, but then it's about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=205.12s)]
*  showing them our vision of the world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=208.48s)]
*  And the great thing about these town halls is it's not just Democrats here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  We have Republicans, Democrats, we have people who haven't voted before, all types of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=214.12s)]
*  people who are upset with what's going on right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=218.84s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen this recent Fox News poll that shows that Donald Trump is completely [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=221.84s)]
*  underwater with his approvals, but also people do not trust him on the economy, on tariffs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=227.4s)]
*  People don't trust him on immigration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=233.52s)]
*  And so we have to continue to bring this message across the country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=235.28s)]
*  But I think it's imperative that when we say it, we say it with open arms. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=238.24s)]
*  That's the whole point of this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=242.52s)]
*  We want to bring people into the coalition and not push them out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=244.12s)]
*  Senator, we started talking at the top of the show about the polling that Congress and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=247.55999999999997s)]
*  Frost was just talking about. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=252.2s)]
*  And you just made a point that I think is really important, which is all the stuff that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump is doing essentially unilaterally, often, I think, unlawfully and unconstitutionally. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=258.2s)]
*  There's this weird kind of like tacit arrangement with Republicans in Congress who kind of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=262.76s)]
*  like what he's doing but never have to vote for it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=267.4s)]
*  So it's like no one ever has to devote to defund a 30 year health study of post-menopausal [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=269.76s)]
*  women. No one has to vote to do all this stuff, which they like because they're not [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=275.8s)]
*  popular votes. But that era is ending because they are now going to have to vote. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=281.08s)]
*  And even if he's a lame duck or Trump's a sort of sui generis figure, do you think the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=286.68s)]
*  polling in politics matters for your colleagues who are going to have to do the voting? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, of course it does. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=297.6s)]
*  The worst thing that they are contemplating doing, probably the most unpopular thing they [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  are contemplating doing, is this budget bill in which they are talking about one trillion [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=304.96s)]
*  dollars of cuts to Medicaid. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=310.08s)]
*  That's just throwing people off of their health insurance overnight in order to fund a trillion [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=311.4s)]
*  dollars of tax cuts for the richest one percent. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  That's deeply unpopular. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=318.56s)]
*  And what we saw in 2017, Chris, is that everybody thought they were going to pass the repeal of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=320.44s)]
*  Obamacare, but they didn't. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  They didn't because they had really slim margins in the House and the Senate, just as [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=326.76s)]
*  slim as they have now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=330.08s)]
*  We are able to throw enough sand in the gears, mobilize people nationally just enough so [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=331.04s)]
*  that we defeated that measure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=335.64s)]
*  But the stink of that effort to repeal Obamacare still stuck with people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=337.52s)]
*  That was why they lost the midterms. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=341.36s)]
*  And so politically, I mean, we should root for them not to get away with this because, A, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=343.96s)]
*  if we stop the Medicaid cuts, it'll help a lot of people. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=349.32s)]
*  But it's not as if the voters will excuse them for trying to do it, even if they don't get [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=351.52s)]
*  away with it. So, yes, we are here in North Carolina because there are a couple of swing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=356.0s)]
*  votes here in the Senate and in the House that might save a whole bunch of lives if they do the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=359.28s)]
*  right thing when this bill to cut Medicaid and fund tax cuts for billionaires comes before the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=363.23999999999995s)]
*  House and Senate. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=367.88s)]
*  Yeah, Tom, tell us your colleague in the Senate is in cycle, meaning he's up for re-election [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=368.88s)]
*  2026. That is a state that Democrats just won statewide offices in in this last election, even [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=373.02s)]
*  as Trump was being elected. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=378.64s)]
*  And, Congressman Frost, you know, those margins are very slim in the House. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  Up until now, it seems that the sort of combination of Trump, Musk and their kind of discipline [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=383.6s)]
*  approach, you know, Musk is going to come in and primary you, drop 20 million dollars on your [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  head if you cross him like all that has kept them in line so far. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=396.36s)]
*  And I wonder whether you think any of that starts to erode or they're still pretty tightly [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  together. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  No, we're starting to see some of it erode and it has to do, I think, a lot with the people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=408.32000000000005s)]
*  power. We're seeing a lot of the events we're doing, a lot of our other colleagues are doing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=412.68s)]
*  across the country and amping up that pressure. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=415.72s)]
*  About a week ago, 12 Republicans sent a letter to Mike Johnson saying we can't support we can't [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=418.68s)]
*  vote yes on a budget that has massive cuts to Medicaid. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=422.88s)]
*  I promise you they would have not sent that letter if it wasn't for activists, organizers, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=425.64s)]
*  citizens going to these town halls, making sure they hear from them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=430.4s)]
*  The phone calls, things like what we're doing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=434.04s)]
*  All of this adds up and puts pressure on these people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=436.12s)]
*  And I think honestly, the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, I think, showed that you can put all [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=439.04s)]
*  this money in, which is horrible. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPITC4_5Uc&t=444.04s)]
