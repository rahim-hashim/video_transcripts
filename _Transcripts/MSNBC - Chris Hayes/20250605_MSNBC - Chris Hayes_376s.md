# ‘Menacing’: Hayes sounds alarm on rise of ‘secret police’ under Trump
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM)
*  The term secret police invokes a kind of haunting specter when you hear it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=0.0s)]
*  When we see representations of secret police in the movies or in history, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=5.2s)]
*  we immediately identify it with a certain kind of regime, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=9.6s)]
*  one that tramples people's liberty with no accountability. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=13.16s)]
*  We associate it with authoritarian governments and dictatorships like the Soviet Union, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=16.26s)]
*  where people usually armed can wield the authority of the state, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=21.56s)]
*  but are themselves totally unaccountable in the same way. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=25.36s)]
*  Whatever issues there are with American policing, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=29.36s)]
*  and there are many, many of which we've covered here, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=31.86s)]
*  at least our police officers have names on their uniforms and badge numbers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=34.32s)]
*  Now, in the Trump-Steven Miller era of immigration and renditioning, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=38.82s)]
*  one cannot help but notice in clip after clip, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=43.22s)]
*  in interaction after interaction, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=46.5s)]
*  the people enacting these raids have all the qualities [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=48.56s)]
*  you associate with the concept of secret police. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=52.16s)]
*  They are usually masked, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=55.3s)]
*  hiding their faces and either wearing plain clothes or irregular uniforms. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=57.56s)]
*  They won't give their names or say what agency they're with. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  Watching it, it feels wrong and weird and alien and menacing, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=65.92s)]
*  like an irregular paramilitary operation or people gathering to rob a bank, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  as one observer said. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=78.0s)]
*  It does not feel like law enforcement officials [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  subject to the authority of a democratic government. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  It's so striking in scene after scene, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=85.56s)]
*  you see regular people asking masked agents, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=87.7s)]
*  who are you? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=91.4s)]
*  What part of the government are you from? What are you doing? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=92.7s)]
*  We saw something like that in one of the first videos made public, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=95.56s)]
*  the arrest of Columbia student and lawful resident, Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  where plain clothes officers apprehended him in the lobby of his building [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  and pointedly refused to identify themselves or who they were with. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=106.4s)]
*  Let me ask, can we get a name, please? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=112.06s)]
*  Can we get your name? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=117.46s)]
*  I understand the lawyer is asking for your name. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=118.96s)]
*  The lawyer is asking for your name. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=123.36s)]
*  He's saying they don't give their names. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=125.06s)]
*  We don't give our name, the man said, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=128.16s)]
*  after handcuffing and detaining a legal resident of this country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=129.76s)]
*  Not long after that, we got this infamous video [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  of the arrest of Tufts graduate student, Ramesa Ozturk. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=136.26s)]
*  She was snatched off the street by masked agents [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  and led away in handcuffs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  Also in Massachusetts, there was this chilling scene from last month [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=144.76s)]
*  where masked agents apparently refused to provide a warrant [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=148.26s)]
*  before breaking a car window [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  and forcibly removing a man that they say was in the country illegally. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=153.56s)]
*  Do you have a warrant for arresting this man? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  Kevin, you're here illegally. I already know that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  That's all I need to establish. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=162.16s)]
*  I need to see a warrant. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=169.76s)]
*  You have masked men taking people, abducting people without a warrant, without IDs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=171.76s)]
*  Just last weekend, this was seen in Great Barrington, Massachusetts [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=179.76s)]
*  where again, masked agents detained an apparently undocumented gardener [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=182.76s)]
*  at his place of work, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=187.76s)]
*  all while his employees were being arrested. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=189.76s)]
*  The police were arrested and arrested. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=191.76s)]
*  The police were arrested and arrested. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=193.76s)]
*  This is a scene where the man is being held by a undocumented gardener [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=195.76s)]
*  at his place of work, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=198.76s)]
*  all while his employers ask questions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=200.76s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=202.76s)]
*  In San Diego, same weekend, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=203.76s)]
*  residents managed to hold back what appeared to be heavily armed, militarized agents [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=205.76s)]
*  who were reportedly just executing an immigration raid on a local business [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=210.76s)]
*  and several local businesses. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=215.76s)]
*  And we've also got these stories of all kinds of really unsettling lies, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=217.76s)]
*  manipulation, subterfuge. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=221.76s)]
*  The New York Times has also reported that the U.S. police in the Arizona area [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=223.76s)]
*  is saying that agents posed as city utility workers as part of an arrest attempt. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=227.76s)]
*  There's been reports of agents gaining access to homes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=232.76s)]
*  under the guise of performing wellness checks on children. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=235.76s)]
*  All this feels like something distinct from the normal forms of policing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=241.76s)]
*  and law enforcement you're used to. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=244.76s)]
*  As the writer M. Gessen, who was born in the Soviet Union, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=246.76s)]
*  put it in a recent column for the New York Times, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=249.76s)]
*  I've seen it before, adding, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=251.76s)]
*  This administration is treating people as if they have no rights, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=272.76s)]
*  as if they can be rounded up at a whim, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=275.76s)]
*  as if they don't get to have any kind of due process [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=277.76s)]
*  or have to show cause or get warrants. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=280.76s)]
*  That is the legal theory of Stephen Miller, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=282.76s)]
*  that immigrants in this country do not have rights, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=285.76s)]
*  even though very clearly that's not true. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=288.76s)]
*  This can't be stressed enough. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=291.76s)]
*  The Constitution is clear on this in its plain text, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=292.76s)]
*  in the 14th Amendment, for instance. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=294.76s)]
*  The precedent is clear on this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=296.76s)]
*  Even Supreme Court justices, as conservative as the late Antonin Scalia, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=297.76s)]
*  have been clear on this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=301.76s)]
*  Immigrants have constitutional rights. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=302.76s)]
*  They have due process rights. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=305.76s)]
*  But the Trump administration and Stephen Miller believe [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=306.76s)]
*  the state can do whatever it wants to these people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=309.76s)]
*  Now we should note Trump's borders are Tom Holman's, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=312.76s)]
*  as the agents are wearing masks for their own safety. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=315.76s)]
*  In a statement NBC News about these recent ice crackdowns, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=334.76s)]
*  Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5il6k7Dp4wM&t=336.76s)]
