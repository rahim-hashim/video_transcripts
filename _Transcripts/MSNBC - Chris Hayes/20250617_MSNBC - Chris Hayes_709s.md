# 'Nobody's safe': NYC comptroller Brad Lander speaks out after ICE arrest
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM)
*  City Controller Brad Lander, who's also currently a candidate for mayor, was in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=0.0s)]
*  Manhattan to escort several immigrants from a federal building. He has been [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=3.84s)]
*  doing this for weeks now, by the way. Like I said, he's going to join me on set in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=9.0s)]
*  just a moment. Today, when federal agents in plain clothes tried to arrest one of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=12.96s)]
*  those immigrants he was escorting, Lander locked arms with the immigrant and just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=17.72s)]
*  demanded to see a warrant for the man's arrest. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  I will let go when you show me the judicial warrant. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=30.0s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=57.6s)]
*  Sir, I have it in my hand here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=59.6s)]
*  Let go! [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=61.6s)]
*  I want to see it! [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=63.6s)]
*  Let go! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=65.6s)]
*  What is this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=67.6s)]
*  Take it back! [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=69.6s)]
*  Take it back! [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=71.6s)]
*  Stay back! [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=73.6s)]
*  You don't have authority to arrest US citizens. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=75.6s)]
*  You don't have the authority to arrest US citizens. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=81.6s)]
*  You don't have the...I'm not obstructing, I'm standing right here in the hallway. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=85.6s)]
*  I asked to see the judicial warrant. By asking for a judicial warrant? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=89.6s)]
*  You don't have the authority to arrest US citizens asking for a judicial warrant. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=95.6s)]
*  Look at the men who escalated that encounter, who handcuffed and arrested [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=99.6s)]
*  Lander in that way. As one Reuters reporter, Michael Derby, later asked, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=103.6s)]
*  based on how these men are dressed, how would you know who they are, who they are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=107.6s)]
*  working for, what their authority is? DHS claimed on social media in New York City [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=111.6s)]
*  controller Brad Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=115.6s)]
*  a federal officer. But we all saw the footage. That did not happen. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=119.6s)]
*  In fact, according to the fantastic nonprofit reporting outlet, The City, who was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=125.6s)]
*  there in the hallway at the time, one of the reporters in the room, quote, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=129.6s)]
*  had overheard one agent say to another minutes before Lander's arrest, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=133.6s)]
*  Do you want to arrest the controller? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=137.6s)]
*  Okay? This is what the beginnings of a police state looks like, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=141.6s)]
*  what it sounds like. And here's the thing to understand. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=145.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign promise of mass deportations of millions, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=149.6s)]
*  I mean, 10 to 13 million people, was always fundamentally [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=153.6s)]
*  a totalitarian project. There is simply no way to pull it off, but to construct [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=157.6s)]
*  a police state that doesn't just create misery and suffering [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=161.6s)]
*  for immigrants, it fundamentally must also be an existential threat to American democracy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=165.6s)]
*  And we're at the very beginning of this project, and look what it looks like already. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=169.6s)]
*  And I'm joined now by New York City controller Mayoral candidate Brad Lander [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=173.6s)]
*  in his first TV interview since being released from detention just a little while ago. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=177.6s)]
*  Good to see you. Thank you for having me on. How are you feeling? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=181.6s)]
*  I mean, I feel angry. I feel sad. I wanted to see [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=185.6s)]
*  Edgardo be able to get out of the building. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=189.6s)]
*  I'm going to be fine. I lost a button on my jacket, but I've got a good lawyer. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=193.6s)]
*  I'll sleep in my bed tonight. He's in ICE detention. He has no lawyer. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=197.6s)]
*  He's been stripped of status and due process. So when you talk about what were you doing, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=201.6s)]
*  what building was it, and what were you doing in that hallway with him? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=205.6s)]
*  Yeah, so that was what we call the federal building, 26 Federal Plaza, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=209.6s)]
*  and there's immigration hearings in it. This is the third week I've gone. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=213.6s)]
*  And what started about three weeks ago is that the Department of Homeland Security [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=217.6s)]
*  has been moving essentially to strip people of their status. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=221.6s)]
*  They were supposed to. They filed asylum applications for the most part, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=225.6s)]
*  and they should get a hearing on whether they've got credible fear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=229.6s)]
*  of violence or repression. Now DHS is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=233.6s)]
*  stripping them of that. And then as soon as the case is over, they don't even know [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=237.6s)]
*  what's happening. And you know, they don't speak English for the most part. They've had some translation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=241.6s)]
*  Then they walk out of the courtroom and as they walk to the elevator, ICE agents [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=245.6s)]
*  grab them up. So what happens is the lawyers [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=249.6s)]
*  for the government say we want to drop the case, right? Like we don't want [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=253.6s)]
*  these are people who are showing up for their court date. Yeah, they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=257.6s)]
*  crossed at the border and checked in. They checked in. And then they got a court date. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=261.6s)]
*  They showed up. The government says to drop it and then the ICE folks [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=265.6s)]
*  nab them. As soon as they had walked toward the elevator lobby. And so [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=269.6s)]
*  what we've been doing the last three weeks is observing in court, trying to advise, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=273.6s)]
*  you know, give them a little bit of, you know, you should object. You should, you have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=277.6s)]
*  an appeal right. And then when they walk out, we just, you know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=281.6s)]
*  walk arm in arm. And seven of the five of the seven families I've walked [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=285.6s)]
*  out with over the last three weeks, we were able to get in the elevator and exit [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=289.6s)]
*  the building and they could go back home to their families. And I mean they were shaking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=293.6s)]
*  in the elevator. And when they got out, I just felt like this is [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=297.6s)]
*  what I'm supposed to be doing as an elected official who cares about the rule of law. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=301.6s)]
*  These are New Yorkers. But yes, then today [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=305.6s)]
*  in two cases, a guy named Zed who speaks Yoruba [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=309.6s)]
*  and then Edgardo who is in that picture. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=313.6s)]
*  We're not so lucky. So did they, what [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=317.6s)]
*  happened, was Zed before this? Zed was before this. So what happened there? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=321.6s)]
*  Our arms were not linked quite so tightly. And they just grabbed [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=325.6s)]
*  them? Just grabbed them. Okay. So then this time you do link arms with [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=329.6s)]
*  the guy. Now I don't want to be a, I'm a journalist. I have to be like [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=333.6s)]
*  very factual here. My understanding is they don't actually need a judicial warrant. They need an [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=337.6s)]
*  administrative warrant but they can also act on probable cause. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=341.6s)]
*  You're asking for a warrant as they're grabbing Agarro. And what [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=345.6s)]
*  are they saying or doing? I mean, you know, you can see it on the video. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=349.6s)]
*  They indicated they had a warrant but did not [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=353.6s)]
*  show it. Right. What do you say to people who say [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=357.6s)]
*  this, that they have the authority, that you're essentially [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=361.6s)]
*  obstructing the law here? I mean, they've changed the rules [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=365.6s)]
*  until about three weeks ago. If you did what you were supposed to do, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=369.6s)]
*  you would eventually get your credible fear hearing. And when the rules are changed and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=373.6s)]
*  even people who do what they're supposed to can't count on not being [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=377.6s)]
*  scooped up and deported, that's bad for everyone when people don't think [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=381.6s)]
*  the rules matter. And that really is what authoritarianism is when [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=385.6s)]
*  the rules can be changed at any minute and you can't count even if you do what [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=389.6s)]
*  you're supposed to, file your asylum application, come to court on your court date. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=393.6s)]
*  Of course people won't start doing that. So all we want is the due [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=397.6s)]
*  process that people are supposed to get. So I'm struck, you know, we played Alex Padilla. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=401.6s)]
*  These are happening in different places in different circumstances. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=405.6s)]
*  One is at a press conference. I'm kind of struck by how [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=409.6s)]
*  rough it is, I gotta say. And partly is law enforcement officials are trained [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=413.6s)]
*  that they need to use forces as due people and they, as a sort of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=417.6s)]
*  safety mechanism. So there's a kind of, there is a kind of training here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=421.6s)]
*  But I mean, both in the case of Padilla and the case of you, like, it looked like you were getting kind of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=425.6s)]
*  roughed up. I mean, you saw it on the video [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=429.6s)]
*  and, you know, it kept going well after we were separated. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=433.6s)]
*  Did it feel like you were getting roughed up? I mean, you know, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=437.6s)]
*  it was, yes. It was not gentle? No, it was not gentle. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=441.6s)]
*  So then what happened after they took you, like, after you disappear? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=445.6s)]
*  Where do you go and what do they tell you about what is the, why are they [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=449.6s)]
*  detaining you? What do they have you for? So honestly, I heard very little. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=453.6s)]
*  And of course the case, you know, they have not brought charges [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=457.6s)]
*  but apparently the U.S. Attorney's Office says they're still reviewing the case. So [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=461.6s)]
*  I don't know exactly what they will come back with. You know, DHS put [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=465.6s)]
*  that preposterous statement out that everyone could see is not what is happening on the video. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=469.6s)]
*  But they didn't tell me any of that. You know, they did take me to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=473.6s)]
*  a detention room. They took the cuffs off and I just sat for three and a half hours [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=477.6s)]
*  in a detention room. Part of what's fascinating is who... [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=481.6s)]
*  But wait, but they didn't tell you, like, you're just in there, there's no nothing? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=485.6s)]
*  Nothing. Come on. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=489.6s)]
*  I'm telling you, I sat for three and a half hours in a detention room. But they just, but nothing, I mean, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=493.6s)]
*  and they know exactly who you are. They know what they're doing. They do. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=497.6s)]
*  They knew who you were. They knew who I was. There's no doubt they knew I was the controller. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=501.6s)]
*  And, you know, talk to me about that. So, and then what happened after three and a half hours? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=505.6s)]
*  Well, first I got to say about who two of the agents were. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=509.6s)]
*  Because this was kind of remarkable in itself. Like the arresting officer [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=513.6s)]
*  is a Pakistani Muslim who lives in Brighton Beach. And the second [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=517.6s)]
*  officer is a Indo-Gayanese immigrant [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=521.6s)]

*  You're trying to rank me, buddy? You know it. I'm absolutely trying to get everybody's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=533.6s)]

*  report crimes to the NYPD. People won't show up at their immigration [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=589.6s)]
*  hearings. So, you know, the reason New York City is proud to have these [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=593.6s)]
*  sanctuary city laws is to say it matters when there is rule of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=597.6s)]

*  And there's some data to suggest that like actually amongst foreign born voters [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=622.6s)]
*  was the biggest swing constituency. That maybe, maybe [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=627.6s)]
*  this is what a lot of immigrants want. I mean, I think what [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=632.6s)]
*  authoritarians are good at is giving you someone to blame. You feel precarious. You don't, housing is so [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=636.6s)]
*  expensive here. You think you're not going to be able to stay. And when someone tells you that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=641.6s)]
*  somebody else's fault, even if it's the people who got here 10 minutes after you arrived, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=646.6s)]

*  They did what they were supposed to. Nobody's safe like that. All right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=665.6s)]
*  You mentioned the statement by DHS, which they accuse you of assaulting a police [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=669.6s)]
*  officer, a law enforcement officer. Did you assault a law enforcement officer? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g30i3bjlUpM&t=674.6s)]
