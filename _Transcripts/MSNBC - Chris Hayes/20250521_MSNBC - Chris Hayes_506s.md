# ‘I regret voting for you’: Van Hollen clashes with Marco Rubio in heated exchange
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM)
*  Donald Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio was confirmed unanimously by his former Senate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=0.0s)]
*  colleagues very early in January. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=5.22s)]
*  Yesterday, some of those Senate senators lambasted him on everything from the administration's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=7.68s)]
*  failure to pressure Israel over its destruction of Gaza, to renditioning people to a Salvadoran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=12.0s)]
*  gulag, to locking up college students for writing op-eds. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=17.28s)]
*  Clearly, you don't care about the Fifth Amendment right to due process, and you don't care about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  the First Amendment either, since you've been very busy snatching students off of college [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=28.2s)]
*  campuses for exercising their right to free speech. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=33.36s)]
*  Our nation has seen times like this before, especially during the Red Scare and Palmer [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=37.08s)]
*  Raids. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=41.86s)]
*  Like the McCarthy-era witch hunts of the 1950s, your campaign of fear and repression is eating [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=43.42s)]
*  away at foundational values of our democracy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=49.18s)]
*  Back then, it took one voice, Attorney Joseph Welch, to cut through the hysteria with a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  simple question that marked the beginning of the end of that shameful era. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=56.56s)]
*  He asked Senator McCarthy, have you no sense of decency? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=60.92s)]
*  And I would ask you the same, Secretary Rubio. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=64.88s)]
*  You have shown through your words and your actions what the answer is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=68.0s)]
*  And I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you for Secretary [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=72.94s)]
*  of State. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=77.4s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=79.4s)]
*  which held that hearing with Secretary of State Rubio, and he joins us now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=82.92s)]
*  It's good to have you on the center. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=86.12s)]
*  Good to be with you, Chris. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=88.28s)]
*  I want to talk about a few topics. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=90.28s)]
*  One of the things you said over the weekend, if I'm not mistaken, I believe at CBS, you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  said that the U.S. is complicit in the starvation of the people of Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  I want to start with just a question about what should our government be doing right [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=99.4s)]
*  now to ensure that there is not mass starvation in Gaza? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=103.44s)]
*  Well, Chris, the most basic thing that the Trump administration should be doing, President [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=111.92s)]
*  Trump, Secretary Rubio, is publicly calling upon the Netanyahu government to immediately [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=116.36s)]
*  allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and to safely reach the people who are starving to death. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=123.12s)]
*  You know, for 78 days, there was a total blockade. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=130.4s)]
*  We didn't even see any acknowledgment from the Trump administration about what was happening. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=134.8s)]
*  Certainly, a few days ago, Donald Trump acknowledges, yes, people are starving in Gaza, but did [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=140.36s)]
*  not combine that with the second half of the message, which is Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=145.96s)]
*  and your government let the food in and stopped starving millions of people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  I've seen some reporting in the Israeli press, which I read pretty closely, that Netanyahu [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=158.24s)]
*  has talked about calls with American senators, primarily, specifically, Republican senators. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  And I guess I want to say this to you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=167.72s)]
*  And if people are watching this happen and feel like they're losing their mind, like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=169.88s)]
*  how can this happen? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=173.8s)]
*  These are innocent children. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=175.84s)]
*  Does it matter if they call their senator? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=177.66s)]
*  Does it matter if they call the representative to tell them they feel that way to then put [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=179.48s)]
*  pressure on the government, the Israeli government? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes, people should be calling their representatives, their House members, their Senate to say to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=186.96s)]
*  Congress, Executive Branch, call upon the Netanyahu government immediately to not just [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=194.2s)]
*  let a little trickle of food across the border, but actually get it to the people who are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  starving, make sure that the aid workers can deliver it without themselves getting killed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=205.64s)]
*  You know, Chris, we voted on a resolution in the Senate just last night. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=211.56s)]
*  Senator Peter Welch offered it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  I was a co-sponsor with him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=217.64s)]
*  It was very simple. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  It acknowledged the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=220.72s)]
*  It said the United States should work to release the hostages and end the war. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=225.28s)]
*  It was blocked by Republican senators. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=230.56s)]
*  So look, if they're quietly calling up Netanyahu and telling them to let the aid in, good. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=232.48s)]
*  And yes, people should be calling. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=238.8s)]
*  But my read of what happened is everybody in the world, except the Trump administration, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=240.6s)]
*  weighed in and said, you've got to deliver the food. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=247.84s)]
*  And the Europeans were especially vocal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=250.04s)]
*  Pope Leo said something. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=252.2s)]
*  The people who are conspicuously absent from that were people like Secretary Rubio and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=254.64s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=260.32s)]
*  Last question on this, and I want to ask about El Salvador. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=261.72s)]
*  But I had you on the program the night the night that Netanyahu and Trump did that joint [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=264.36s)]
*  appearance in which Trump announced that we were going to own the Gaza Strip and maybe [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=269.08s)]
*  forcibly or voluntarily displaced the civilian population there. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=274.08s)]
*  Today, Netanyahu, in talking about his plan for Gaza, said that it's all towards implementing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=278.6s)]
*  Trump's plan on Gaza. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=286.6s)]
*  The Times of Israel saying it represents the first time the U.S. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  president's plan for moving Gaza civilians out of the strip has been presented as an [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=290.8s)]
*  Israeli demand for ending the war. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  Is that come as a surprise to you? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=297.72s)]
*  It is not, Chris, and I'm glad you raised this essential point. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=301.0s)]
*  I have with me a Haaretz article, an Israeli newspaper article, headline, Finance Minister [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=304.92s)]
*  Smotrich, we are destroying everything that remains in Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=309.92s)]
*  The world isn't stopping us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=314.16s)]
*  And what he points out is the plan is, first of all, to effectively ethnically cleanse [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians out of the northern part of Gaza, send them all to the southern part of Gaza, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=321.64s)]
*  and then he says that they can then implement Donald Trump's plan. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump's plan is to forcibly displace Palestinians, which does amount to ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=332.0s)]
*  You have raised a legal issue with what, to me, is a sort of the kind of moral abomination [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=338.84s)]
*  of the rendering into a Salvadoran prison of 200 plus migrants, including Kilmar Brego Garcia. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=344.8s)]
*  You and Ed Markey have noted that the government, the U.S. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=352.48s)]
*  government's U.S. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=355.68s)]
*  taxpayer dollars are actually paying for this in the form of six million dollars, I believe, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=356.68s)]
*  of the price tag, being paid by American public dollars to the government in El Salvador, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=361.68s)]
*  and I've questioned whether that's actually even legal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=367.52s)]
*  Explain. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=370.68s)]
*  Well, because these are taxpayer dollars going to the Bukele government in El Salvador. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=371.68s)]
*  And remember, President Bukele called himself the world's coolest dictator. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=378.76s)]
*  But these are taxpayer dollars going to El Salvador for the purpose of taking people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=383.72s)]
*  off the streets of the United States in violation of their constitutional due process rights [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  and locking them up in notorious prisons. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=396.38s)]
*  So these are American taxpayer dollars going to prevent people who reside in the United [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=400.22s)]
*  States from getting their Fifth Amendment due process rights recognized. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=405.98s)]
*  So this is an outrageous scheme. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=410.62s)]
*  We think it is an illegal expenditure. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=414.22s)]
*  And we're also going to be holding the government of El Salvador accountable. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=417.18s)]
*  But for God's sakes, right now we just need for the Trump administration to obey the nine [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  to zero Supreme Court ruling to facilitate his return since they've already admitted [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=426.02s)]
*  he was wrongfully deported. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  How confident are you that that eventually is what they're going to do? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=434.62s)]
*  We are in a weird liminal space now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=438.94s)]
*  What is your read on where things stand now? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=440.74s)]
*  Right now they're stonewalling the federal district court judge in the case, Judge Zinnis, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  claiming they can't provide information because of the State Secret Act, which is just a total [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=450.06s)]
*  subterfuge for continuing to flout the Supreme Court order. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  In fact, the judge has said that their explanation for invoking the State Secret Act is not adequate, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  doesn't stand the test, smell test. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  So we'll have to see. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=466.86s)]
*  But this could be the case. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=468.18s)]
*  This is so important, not only because of the man of Rego Garcia, but because it implicates [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=470.34s)]
*  all of our Fifth Amendment rights. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=474.97999999999996s)]
*  And it could be the first one where we find out whether they will openly defy the Supreme [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=476.09999999999997s)]
*  Court of the United States. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=481.58s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen, Maryland, thank you for your time tonight, sir. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_bkwFyZNSM&t=500.34s)]
