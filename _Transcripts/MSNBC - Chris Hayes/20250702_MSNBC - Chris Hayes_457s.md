# 'Epitomizes everything': Trump reportedly didn’t realize his bill strips Medicaid
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws)
*  Mr. Speaker, I found the preamble to this big ugly bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=0.0s)]
*  We the billionaires and our king, in order to deform and sicken our union, establish [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=5.16s)]
*  injustice, ensure domestic servility, weaken our people's defenses, undermine the general [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=10.96s)]
*  welfare and reserve to ourselves in our posterity staggering debt servitude for eternity, do [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=17.8s)]
*  hereby instruct the Republicans in Congress to strip 17 million people of their health [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=24.28s)]
*  care, increase co-pays, deductibles and premiums for everyone else. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, delivered what he said should be the preamble [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  to that bill currently working its way through Congress as a ranking member of the Judiciary [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=40.8s)]
*  Committee and he joins me now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=44.96s)]
*  Congressman, let me just first start by your understanding of where things do stand with [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=46.72s)]
*  this bill. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  It's up in the air. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=53.48s)]
*  We've been sent home for the night. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=55.76s)]
*  There are at least three groups of Republicans who are acting very recalcitrant and evasive. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  One are those who are saying that this is an absolute debt exploder and they spend all [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=66.2s)]
*  their time talking about reducing deficits and debt and this will add three and a half [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=72.72s)]
*  or four trillion dollars to the debt. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=77.0s)]
*  A second group is those who are really afraid, if not for moral reasons, then at least political [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=79.08s)]
*  reasons of what it means to throw 17 million people off of Medicaid and 42 million people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=84.0s)]
*  off of nutrition assistance. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=90.32s)]
*  So they might be afraid for their election or they might be having some pang of conscience [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=92.0s)]
*  about it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=96.6s)]
*  And the third are those who learn from the Senate that they should hold out and try to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=97.6s)]
*  shake Trump down for whatever it is they can extract for themselves or their particular [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=102.32s)]
*  political groupings or their district. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=109.36s)]
*  So that's what's creating this long holdup. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=111.36s)]
*  The shocking thing is they allocated only one hour of debate, 30 minutes on each side, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=114.52s)]
*  to this entire bill, which will be absolutely life changing for basically everybody in America, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=120.28s)]
*  one hour of debate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=126.52s)]
*  And then they kept us waiting around for six, seven, eight hours. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=127.88s)]
*  We could have been debating the bill and talking about its provisions, but they would prefer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=132.2s)]
*  to just have everybody wandering around in the dark and eating bad pizza all night. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=136.04s)]
*  There was this exchange that happened today reported by the outlet Notas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  And I wanted to get your thoughts on it because it to me kind of epitomizes everything about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=146.04s)]
*  where we are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=150.76s)]
*  According to three sources with direct knowledge of the comments, this is Trump meeting with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=152.16s)]
*  the holdouts. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=155.04s)]
*  The president told Republicans at this meeting, there are three things Congress shouldn't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=156.04s)]
*  touch that they want to win elections, Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=159.44s)]
*  Well, we're touching Medicaid in this bill. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=164.24s)]
*  One member responded to Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=165.52s)]
*  According to the three sources, we don't know what Trump said back. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=167.12s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of discussion on the floor about whether or not Trump really understands [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=172.48s)]
*  what's in this bill or not and whether he's out of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=177.88s)]
*  And the extraordinary thing about that is that, of course, all of these people have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=180.84s)]
*  gotten in line despite their own misgivings because Trump is leading the way. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=184.52s)]
*  But Trump might not even understand what's in the bill. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=190.2s)]
*  So it's a very dangerous moment when you think about what democracy is and it doesn't speak [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=194.0s)]
*  well for what has become of the Republican Party. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=198.88s)]
*  Now, some people think that, you know, it's just Trump's devilishly clever politics where [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=201.6s)]
*  he's already distancing himself from a bill that he knows will be a nightmare. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=208.32s)]
*  And then he'll blame it on somebody else for not having told him what was really in there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=212.88s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  The point is that we should, as a society, be able to step back from this and say, look, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  if it's a great bill, let's take two weeks and explain to everybody how great it is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=222.56s)]
*  And if it's a terrible bill, let's get rid of it and let's start all over again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I think, I mean, my read on this is that he doesn't really care that much one [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=233.12s)]
*  way or the other and certainly doesn't care enough to spend the time to understand, like, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=236.4s)]
*  the distributional consequences of the Medicaid provisions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=241.72s)]
*  Like, there's no way that if you sat him down, he could talk you through what's happening [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=244.64s)]
*  here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=249.2s)]
*  But the other thing that I wanted to ask you about is part of what's so weird to me is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=250.2s)]
*  we had, you know, the first few months of this administration and Elon Musk with his [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=253.6s)]
*  chainsaw at Doge and Russ voted OMB, who basically have staked themselves in the constitutional [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  principle that spending decisions for Congress are simple advice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=263.44s)]
*  They're sort of suggestions. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=269.32s)]
*  And then the executive can do with them what they want. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=271.24s)]
*  And it's very weird to be legislating under those circumstances to me, like all this ice [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=273.56s)]
*  money, right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Like, presumably some future Democratic administration could be like, no, we're not spending it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  Like, it doesn't seem to have fundamentally sunk into Congress that they have allowed [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  so much power to accrete to Trump and the executive. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=288.64s)]
*  Well, the Democrats understand it because, of course, what he's doing is sabotaging all [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  of the legislation that we've either gotten passed with President Biden or that we've [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  fought for some kind of compromise with the Republicans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=304.24s)]
*  And he thinks he's got the power just to impound it, thwart it, redirect it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=307.56s)]
*  And it's an absolute violation of Congress's powers under the spending clause under Article [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  one of the Constitution. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=316.88s)]
*  And it is scandalous that the Republicans won't stand up for that at all. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=318.68s)]
*  They act like our power is purely advisory, like we're a recommendation panel for what [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=323.36s)]
*  should happen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=330.36s)]
*  And so we are we know that the district courts and the appeals courts have been standing [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=331.36s)]
*  with us on this question. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=337.2s)]
*  And we hope that, you know, Thomas and Alito are not able to pull the rest of the court [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=338.6s)]
*  over to this monarchical understanding of Article two of the Constitution, that somehow [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=344.88s)]
*  the president can do whatever he wants. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=350.12s)]
*  I mean, the president's core job is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  not thwarted and rewritten and not impounded. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=357.64s)]
*  And Appropriations Act, Chris, as you know, is a federal law, just like the law saying [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=361.16s)]
*  you cannot assault a federal officer. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=366.48s)]
*  You can't violate an appropriations act and just decide you're going to use the money [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  for a different purpose. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=373.48s)]
*  Do you think the political consequences will show up for your members of the House who [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  vote for this bill, particularly those say the ones in the swing districts, the ones [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=379.84s)]
*  like Derek Van Orden in Wisconsin, who's got a lot of Medicaid recipients in rural hospitals [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  in his district? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=388.0s)]
*  Yes, because the pain will start to be felt immediately as millions of people are thrown [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  off of Medicaid, off Medicare in different ways, the Affordable Care Act. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=395.96s)]
*  And as people lose their SNAP benefits. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  And what is it for? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=404.96s)]
*  They can't say it's for deficit reduction or debt reduction. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=406.08s)]
*  They're adding trillions of dollars to the debt. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  It's all to give money to the very richest people in the society who run the Republican [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=411.8s)]
*  Party and they will continue this authoritarian program. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, authoritarianism is always involved in class war of the rich against the rest [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=420.68s)]
*  of society. And so they're acting out this drama. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzmLp9RoLws&t=426.84000000000003s)]
