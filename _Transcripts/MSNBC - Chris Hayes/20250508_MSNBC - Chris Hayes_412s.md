# 'Dark joke': MAHA influencer with no medical license tapped as Trump's surgeon general
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y)
*  It feels like every single day without fail there's some new headline about the nation's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  health infrastructure that feels like a dark joke. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=3.96s)]
*  We've got the largest measles outbreak since eradication, to nearly $2 billion in research [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=7.08s)]
*  grants being canceled, and the latest is this one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=13.52s)]
*  Donald Trump taps wellness influencer close to RFK Jr. for surgeon general. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=16.32s)]
*  Her name is Dr. Casey Means, though she is not a licensed medical doctor. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=22.72s)]
*  She is an online holistic wellness influencer, which means she goes on a lot of shows touting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=27.04s)]
*  her health advice. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=32.94s)]
*  This overwhelming amount of sugar we're eating is one of the factors that is leading our [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=35.4s)]
*  bodies to be underpowered on the physiologic level, meaning literally a dimming of our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=40.08s)]
*  life force. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=44.76s)]
*  I bet that one vaccine probably isn't causing autism. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=45.76s)]
*  But what about the 20 that they're getting before 18 months? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=48.86s)]
*  I want to be able to form a relationship with a local farmer, understand his integrity, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=52.92s)]
*  look him in the eyes, pet his cow, and then understand if I can drink his milk. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=60.24s)]
*  Kathleen Sebelius serves as the secretary of health and human services under President [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=65.64s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=68.76s)]
*  She also serves as the democratic governor of Kansas, and she joins me now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=69.76s)]
*  I guess I should first ask what the surgeon general is and how important a job is it? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=73.6s)]
*  Well, Chris, nice to be with you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=81.32s)]
*  The surgeon general is known as the nation's doctor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=84.6s)]
*  They don't have individual patients. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=89.16s)]
*  They have the country, and it's more of a public face for public health. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  A person who is called upon to pick strategic messages, push them out to the American public, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  travel around the country and hopefully get the attention of the American people around [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=106.04s)]
*  issues that can make us healthier and live longer and extend life. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  So it's an important position. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=115.92s)]
*  I had the privilege of working with Regina Benjamin, who is an amazing rural health doctor, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=117.76s)]
*  clinics in Alabama. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  They got wiped out in the hurricanes and put them all back together, treated patients all [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  over with Vivek Murthy, who people got to know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=130.72s)]
*  He focused on loneliness and focused on isolation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=136.96s)]
*  He did an amazing mental health job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=141.12s)]
*  So it's a position that can have real impact on people's lives day in and day out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=144.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at one level, right, because it is a very public facing job and it is a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=148.44s)]
*  messaging job, it's an attention job, having someone who's clearly good at that, she's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=154.52s)]
*  a professional influencer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=159.88s)]
*  And you can see from the clips, like she's she is a compelling person to listen, talk [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=160.88s)]
*  to, makes a certain amount of sense. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=164.28s)]
*  Some of what she's saying, like we have chronic disease in this country because we eat too [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=167.16s)]
*  much sugar is kind of non-controversial. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=171.72s)]
*  But then it seems like there's a fair amount of woo woo nonsense in there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=175.0s)]
*  And she's also not a licensed physician. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=179.02s)]
*  And her views on vaccines make me very nervous. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=182.12s)]
*  And I guess I wonder, like, how bad is it? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=184.6s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=188.28s)]
*  Well, it can be really bad. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=189.28s)]
*  I think that the irony to me is that I wish the Republicans had had this enthusiasm about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=191.84s)]
*  healthy eating and healthy food. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=198.32s)]
*  When Michelle Obama had this as her agenda, starting in 2009, 16 years ago, calling out [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  childhood obesity, redoing school lunches, looking at ways that, you know, John Hickenlooper [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=206.68s)]
*  now a senator as mayor of Denver had scratch kitchens put in every school in Denver. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=213.44s)]
*  Head Start, which has just been canceled by HHS, has an entire program teaching parents [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  to cook and teaching kids about healthy food. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=225.44s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of common ground on that issue. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=228.32s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=232.12s)]
*  What I've seen this woman say is she's an anti-vaxxer. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=233.12s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=238.12s)]
*  That is a terrifying position for the secretary to hold. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a terrifying position for the surgeon general. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=242.76s)]
*  And it will confuse and potentially kill people in this country if parents really aren't sure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=245.0s)]
*  of the advice they're given. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=252.12s)]
*  Go after processed foods. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=254.2s)]
*  Go after salt and sugar and food. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=256.92s)]
*  Talk to your colleague in the Ag Department to take on the food industry and to, you know, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=259.08s)]
*  make sure that people can have fewer antibiotics in the meat that they eat. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=265.64s)]
*  Those are all things that could make us healthier. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=271.32s)]
*  We had a huge prevention fund in the Affordable Care Act that the Republicans called for years [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=274.68s)]
*  a slush fund. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=279.56s)]
*  If cities and schools and counties. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=281.56s)]
*  So there's a lot of common ground here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=283.44s)]
*  It seems like this team has just woken up to the fact that, you know, we could do something [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=285.76s)]
*  about the food we eat and the movement that our kids make and the opportunity to live [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=291.4s)]
*  healthier, to stay out of clinical medicine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=298.6s)]
*  But boy, you mix that with lots of false information and making up stuff and pushing supplements [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=301.16s)]
*  that have no proven value. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=307.56s)]
*  And then you have a real mess on your hands. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=309.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=312.6s)]
*  And we should say, you know, she's written that there's growing evidence that current [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=313.6s)]
*  extreme growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines and vulnerable children needs [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=316.44000000000005s)]
*  to be investigated. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=320.8s)]
*  I mean, there's more than messaging here, too. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=321.8s)]
*  I mean, the RFK's HHS looks like it's targeting vaccines at an actual operational level, not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  just that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=329.12s)]
*  Quickly, in the last minute here, have you followed the raw milk thing? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=330.12s)]
*  Like it is such a huge deal for these people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, my understanding is like, if some small marginal group of people want to drink raw [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=338.28s)]
*  milk, it's probably not worth a ton of government resources to like stop them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=343.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=347.2s)]
*  But like doing it at scale seems like a crazy thing to do to promote for the government. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=348.24s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=354.08s)]
*  Well, again, I don't. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=355.08s)]
*  I'm not an expert on dairy products. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=358.6s)]
*  What I know is much like vaccines, pasteurization was a huge improvement in the health and well-being [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=360.88s)]
*  of people. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=367.6s)]
*  And, you know, decades ago, that decision was made and the problem was solved. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=368.6s)]
*  So I have no idea, you know, what the benefits could or might be. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=374.36s)]
*  What I know is lots of doctors who do have medical licenses and see patients, lots of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=380.4s)]
*  doctors say this is pretty dangerous for a bunch of people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  And I believe them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQp1MmUt3_Y&t=390.04s)]
