# FULL CONVO: Ta-Nehisi Coates and Chris Hayes on protests in America and more
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4)
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates is a national book award-winning author and journalist. His acclaimed work, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=0.0s)]
*  Between the World and Me, is being re-released in paperback on its 10th anniversary next week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=4.96s)]
*  In his most recent book, The Message, is out now. Ta-Nehisi Coates, good to have you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=9.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=14.08s)]
*  We have not gotten to just talk on air in a bit. A lot has happened. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  You think? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=19.44s)]
*  Well, we got a US military parade on the birthday of the President of the United States, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=20.52s)]
*  ostensibly for the armed services. We've got deployments of Marines on American streets. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=27.04s)]
*  One of the themes of your work is like, this has always been a perilous and contested thing, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=34.64s)]
*  this thing we have. But it does feel very perilous to me right now, and I'm curious how it feels to you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=39.04s)]
*  Well, I try to hold two things in my mind. The fact that the moment in Trump does not spring out [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  of nowhere, that it does have a historical connection. At the same time, this is a moment. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=52.0s)]
*  You don't just roll your eyes and say, oh, well, it's always been this way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=59.36s)]
*  I think there's something very, very different about this, certainly since the post-civil rights [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=64.32s)]
*  era. One of the things that really successes the movement was that it made a certain kind of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=69.52s)]
*  open bigotry and really just a kind of malevolent spirit, like shameful, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=77.12s)]
*  at least within the borders of America, I should say. It's just not anymore. It just isn't. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=87.36s)]
*  And I think one of Trump's great, great insights was that previous Republicans [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=93.84s)]
*  tried to channel a little bit of that, and then move over here. It was like Willie Horton was the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=99.28s)]
*  ad, but that's not the entirety of it. He just realized, no, Willie Horton is the thing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=105.44s)]
*  That's the actual thing. That's what you want to see. That's what you all are here for, really. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=110.16s)]
*  There's no reason to do the dog whistle or the bait and the switch. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=115.68s)]
*  No, no, let's yell. Let's just yell. You know what I mean? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=118.64s)]
*  I mean, one of the things about what we've seen them do on the civil rights front to me [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=121.44s)]
*  is that I think there are sort of twin messages, which is a little intentional with what you just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=126.56s)]
*  said, but hear me out. One is like, oh, you don't like the censorious left. You think these campus [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=131.2s)]
*  kids are being annoying, right? And the excess of the left, and there's that appeal. And then there's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  the, no, we're going to roll back the civil rights movement. And he actually gave an executive order [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=142.64s)]
*  in his first week, rolling back a civil rights movement executive order by Lyndon Baines Johnson. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=148.56s)]
*  I feel like there is a little bit of people who may be voted for the first and are getting the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=153.04s)]
*  second. What do you think? I think that's probably true, but there is no vote for the first and get [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=157.36s)]
*  the second. There are people who probably are relatively close to my politics, who, especially [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=162.0s)]
*  around DEI, want to do a kind of got to hand it to him. You know what I mean? Like, oh, he does have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  a point. But the point is not, you know, merely let's get rid of DEI. You know what I mean? Like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=179.12s)]
*  anybody who says that there's a larger thing going on, if you make that a part of your politics, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=185.52s)]
*  you know, I just don't take it for granted that you're annoyed by some presentation that was made [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=191.28s)]
*  in a corporate, you know, a boardroom somewhere or some sort of anti-racism training that you had to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  go through that you feel like had nothing, you know, to do with your job. Because people deal [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=201.12s)]
*  with BS in their jobs all the time. Why does this particular brand of BS so offend you? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like, oh, I saw an annoying PowerPoint works. Right. Yeah, that's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=212.16s)]
*  work. That's work. That's work. That's work. And so if you run an anti-racism movement through [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  corporate America, probably going to be some BS in there. You know what I mean? But why does this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=222.0s)]
*  particular brand of BS attract your ire, more than all the rest? You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  One of the essays in the message is about having a book of yours removed from a book list. And [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  we've seen this like, I mean, really just heavy handed like Jackie Robinson gets purged from the, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, the Pentagon's website about history and books being taken out of West Point, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=246.24s)]
*  you know, about racial equality. Like is that, is that to you about what you expected going in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=252.4s)]
*  or has the heavy handedness felt surprising? That's a great question. It's a great question [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=259.92s)]
*  because like I actually have to ask myself that. Like, I think like, it's one thing like to see the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=266.4s)]
*  math and to say, okay, the math, this is not out of line with the math would say what happened. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=274.32s)]
*  You know, you go back and look at it, you can't say, oh my God. But at the same time, I don't know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  like, and maybe this is a good thing. There's just a kind of base thing I think in us that says, no, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=283.84s)]
*  they won't go this far. You know, they won't because you hope, A, and also like you want to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=289.28s)]
*  give your fellow human beings some amount of credit to say Jackie Robinson really like that far, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=293.6s)]
*  you know what I mean? But turns out, yeah, they will. I mean, I think on that point, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=299.68s)]
*  you know, that point you made in the first answer about one of the achievements of civil [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=304.24s)]
*  rights movement was creating a version of kind of multiracial pluralism as a kind of default [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=308.88s)]
*  American consensus, like way that we operate in public discourse. Jackie Robinson hero, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=313.36s)]
*  we all just everyone gets that white kids get that black kids, everyone gets that in school, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  right? And that there there's an assault on that. And I also think there is some strength though, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=324.8s)]
*  in that thing. Yeah, you know, that's bigger than them that more people maybe are on board [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=329.44s)]
*  for that version of a pluralistic America than they count on. I think so. I hope so. I hope so. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=334.0s)]
*  I think so. And I hope so. And you know, I am one who have, you know, it's kind of grappled [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=340.08s)]
*  with that vision, you know what I mean? And in places where, you know, maybe it's needed in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=346.8s)]
*  other places where I think it has some shortcomings. But it's certainly better than what we have now, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=351.04s)]
*  you know? You know, one of the one of the themes of Between the World and Me is about the arc of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  racial progress and and and backlash and the ways that we the sort of stories we tell ourselves [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=363.6s)]
*  about the American experience. And one of the things I think you see now in the discourse, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  you're seeing it now with the protests in LA. And you know, if there's an image of a burning Waymo, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=376.32s)]
*  this this is what, you know, is the predicate for the troops. This idea that reactionary turns are [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=380.88s)]
*  always the call are always caused by liberal or movement or left overreach. Right. And what you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=389.36s)]
*  think about that, that default setting? You know, I think part of it is to go back to where we started [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=396.32s)]
*  this conversation, I think people have a misapprehension of what the civil rights movement was. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=401.84s)]
*  And I think they believe that it was young people showing up in three piece suits, always on their [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=406.8s)]
*  best behavior, you know, never struggling with, you know, that their emotions never doing things [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=413.84s)]
*  that weren't, you know, particularly intelligent or strategic or and that's actually not the case. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=419.84s)]
*  In fact, nonviolence takes an incredible amount of training and discipline. It is human to want to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=425.12s)]
*  defend yourself. It is human, you know, to act out, you know, of rage. It is human when people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=431.6s)]
*  come into your community and snatch them off the block. You know what I mean? To want to yell or [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  maybe, you know, pick up a rock and throw something at people that are doing it. That is just, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=441.12s)]
*  I think, true of any human community. Now that's separate from the conversation of whether it's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=446.24s)]
*  good strategically or not. Right. Right. Right. But I don't think like, I mean, I was a struggle [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  during the civil rights movement to get people to not throw rocks. It was a huge deal to get people [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=455.04s)]
*  to be disciplined, to get people. It was a constant thing. The king was always dealing with. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=459.12s)]
*  Sometimes it broke down, you know, he's in Chicago or somewhere like that. And so I just think like [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=462.8s)]
*  we have to remember that there's a natural element to this, you know what I mean? And not hold, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=467.2s)]
*  you know, folks to a standard that really isn't a standard, but is, you know, a vision of how, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=476.72s)]
*  you know, the story has been told to us. Your last book, The Message, is a book about a lot of things. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a book about writing in some ways and the ability of writing and why writing matters. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=485.6s)]
*  And one of those essays is about the war in Gaza after October 7th. And one of the feelings I have [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  thought in my own coverage of October 7th and its aftermath is a feeling of impotence that like [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  no amount changes the dynamic. Yeah. And part of what the book and the essay is about is about a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  faith that you can persuade people through writing, that like communication matters and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=513.92s)]
*  writing matters. And I wonder how much you think about that. Well, just a small correction, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=517.04s)]
*  because I didn't, the book actually was on reporting. That was before October 7th, mostly. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=525.76s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. It came out after though, I should say. Yes. Yeah. But your question is not off. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=530.0s)]
*  You know what I have felt? I have felt that like you have these moments that you read about in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=537.12s)]
*  history, whether it's during slavery, whether it's, you know, I don't know, during Jim Crow, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=542.32s)]
*  during any moment where you see some sort of violence directed by a group of people [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  towards another group that really can't do anything about it and people either just kind of look away [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=559.84s)]
*  or in certain cases they fund it and actually actively support it. And [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=566.0s)]
*  I have been watching this and I'm like, oh, this is how it happens. This is how, you know, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=570.0s)]
*  Trail of Tears happens and people just let it, you know, how Native Americans for years are just [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=574.08s)]
*  kind of pushed off of their land and people just allow for it, how slavery happens. Like you just [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=578.24s)]
*  walk by somebody being auctioned off. There was a young lady and I'm sorry I'm on the spot and I [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=582.72s)]
*  can't conjure her name right now. And so I apologize to her and her family, but this young, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, 12 year old girl in Gaza who used Instagram to try to bring hope to people's lives. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=590.88s)]
*  That was a whole thing. She would tell people how to survive and they killed her and they killed [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=598.48s)]
*  her. And I saw that and I said, we all have our moments, you know what I mean? And like that was [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=603.92s)]
*  one for me. And so it's just like, oh, this is just going to happen and people are just going to look. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=610.56s)]
*  And I go back to something I felt in 2024 and, you know, maybe this is just emotion, you know, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=617.36s)]
*  speaking here, but, you know, being at the convention, I remain in the space of, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoBHjpAWDv4&t=625.6s)]
