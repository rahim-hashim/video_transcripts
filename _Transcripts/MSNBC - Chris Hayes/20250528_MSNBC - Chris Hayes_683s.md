# ‘No MAGA left behind’: Trump pardons criminals with MAGA ties or deep pockets
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump is of course the first felon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=0.0s)]
*  ever elected president of the United States and now he's handing out get out of jail free [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=5.12s)]
*  cards. Over the last 24 hours he's been on something of a pardon spree. This afternoon [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  alone he granted clemency to at least half dozen people including a pardon for the former [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=15.32s)]
*  Republican governor of Connecticut John Rowland who was convicted in two federal criminal [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=19.94s)]
*  cases. A rapper who goes by the name MBA Youngboy who was sentenced to nearly two years in prison [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=24.62s)]
*  in a federal gun case. Former lieutenant Mark Boshaw who was court marshaled for disobeying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=29.92s)]
*  COVID rules. Now in many cases Donald Trump uses the power of the presidency to grant [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=35.68s)]
*  a kind of criminal immunity to those he deems to be for lack of a better phrase his kind [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  of people. Last year you may remember Trump's hand-picked Supreme Court ruled that basically [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  anything the president does or at least this president does we'll see if this lasts anything [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=53.6s)]
*  this president does that could possibly be construed as an official act of office cannot [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=58.24s)]
*  be subsequently criminally prosecuted. It was a wild ruling based on wholly invented [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=63.24s)]
*  doctrine and it was effectively a pardon from the court to a man facing multiple criminal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=69.68s)]
*  trials including over his citing a violent insurrection. So now Trump wants to reorient [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=75.98s)]
*  federal justice system to extend that same immunity to anyone he deems similarly above [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=83.24s)]
*  the law. Namely anyone who commits the kind of crimes that Donald Trump might commit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=90.24s)]
*  Anyone who's a vocal supporter of Donald Trump or commits crimes in his name and most importantly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=97.24s)]
*  perhaps anyone who is a family member willing to show up to million dollar fundraisers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=104.08s)]
*  Just take a look at the front page of the New York Times today with the headline quote [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=109.48s)]
*  pardon for a donor's son after a one million dollar dinner. That's referring to a guy named [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Paul Walzak. He's a Florida nursing home executive who pleaded guilty to tax crimes last year [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=118.44s)]
*  less than two weeks after Donald Trump was elected. Now almost immediately according [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=125.08s)]
*  to the Times reporting Walzak started angling for a pardon from the incoming president quote [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Walzak submitted a pardon application to President Trump around inauguration day. The application [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=135.24s)]
*  focused not solely on his offenses but also on the political activity of his mother Elizabeth [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Fago. Fago had raised millions of dollars for Trump's campaigns and those of other Republicans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=144.84s)]
*  the application said. It also highlighted her connections to an effort to sabotage Joe [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=150.18s)]
*  Biden's 2020 campaign by publicizing the addiction diary of his daughter Ashley Biden an episode [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=155.72000000000003s)]
*  that drew law enforcement scrutiny. Now it would appear that was not enough to sway President [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=163.28s)]
*  Trump however. So Walzak's mother tried a different approach quote Fago was invited [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=169.16s)]
*  to a one million dollar per person fundraising dinner last month that promised face to face [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=174.64s)]
*  access to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club. Less than three weeks after she attended the dinner [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=180.28s)]
*  Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for her son. Keep in mind that's a fundraising [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=186.08s)]
*  dinner at Mar-a-Lago for a guy who doesn't have a re-election campaign. Now that pardon [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=190.4s)]
*  means Walzak avoided an 18 month prison sentence. He also and this is pretty sweet no longer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=196.96s)]
*  had to pay the government more than four million dollars in restitution which boy sounds like [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=203.36s)]
*  a pretty damn good return on investment for a one million dollar fundraiser. Now to be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=208.6s)]
*  clear we don't know that the pardon was connected to the fundraiser. It's possible this was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=214.56s)]
*  just a coincidence. The timing certainly looks suspicious. Go to the fundraiser get the pardon. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=220.16s)]
*  And the topic of selling pardons just straight up selling them was certainly a concern for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=227.24s)]
*  judges at least non-Supreme Court judges when Trump's immunity case was before the Court [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=232.64s)]
*  of Appeals. You're saying a president could sell pardons could sell military secrets could [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=238.16s)]
*  order SEAL Team 6 to assessing a political rival. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=245.78s)]
*  Sale of military secrets strikes me as something that might not be held to be an official act. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=249.06s)]
*  The sale of pardons is something that's come up historically and was not prosecuted. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=252.46s)]
*  Oh okay really the sale of pardons fine. Now the Trump philosophy in a nutshell is that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=256.34s)]
*  the law is for incarcerating poor people and going after political enemies and deporting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=264.58s)]
*  legal residents without due process. That's what it's there for. It is not for seeking [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=270.46s)]
*  justice against wealthy tax cheats with well-connected moms. Nor is it for locking up Trump supporters [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=274.58s)]
*  who stormed the Capitol and bashed in the brains of police officers and tried to overturn [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=281.74s)]
*  the results of a free and fair election that he lost. No those people including the ones [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=287.86s)]
*  who assaulted police officers and the ones convicted of seditious conspiracy against [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=292.06s)]
*  our union no they got a full unconditional pardon on Trump's very first day which in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=296.5s)]
*  retrospect I think we can all agree was kind of a signal where this was all headed. And [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=300.9s)]
*  then don't forget on his second day he pardoned a man named Ross Ulbrich the so-called murderer [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  of the Bitcoin movement a guy who sort of ran the dark web website known as Silk Road [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=310.78s)]
*  which was probably the biggest drug trafficking website on earth at one point. I mean it was [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=317.38s)]
*  basically this sort of black market marketplace where you could get anything you could purchase [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=322.9s)]
*  instance Fetinal which this administration talks so much about wanting to keep outside our borders [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=328.86s)]
*  and about how much they're cracking down on it but then they pardon this guy. In fact Trump was [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=334.7s)]
*  very clear that Ulbrich's pardon was quote in honor of the libertarian movement which supported [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=339.74s)]
*  me so strongly and in quote the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=344.18s)]
*  are involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me. Incidentally Ulbrich met [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=349.02s)]
*  with Trump's buddy Roger Stone early this month another recipient of a presidential pardon. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=353.54s)]
*  He is set to speak at a Bitcoin conference along with the vice president of the United States [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=358.46s)]
*  JD Vance and the president's sons Eric and Don Jr. Again that's the guy who was convicted [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  by a federal jury for drug trafficking like probably more drug trafficking than just about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=369.74s)]
*  any other drug trafficker given the scale and scope of this website but you see in Trump's view when [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=374.86s)]
*  drug trafficking is facilitated by brown people from foreign countries it's a crisis so severe [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=380.3s)]
*  requires the US to effectively end due process when drug trafficking is facilitated by a clean [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=387.22s)]
*  cut libertarian guy who looks like a peer of the vice president and Don Jr. It's something not only [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=392.66s)]
*  to be tolerated it's to be commended celebrated. We are seeing this story play out over and over [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=398.74s)]
*  again especially when it comes to what we used to call corruption and white collar crime. It's the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  category of people who Donald Trump might have as say Mar-a-Lago members who under his definition [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=411.94s)]
*  and this is key to understand cannot by definition be criminals like Carlos Watson the founder of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=418.42s)]
*  Aussie media who was sentenced to nearly a decade in prison after being convicted for fraud and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=424.26s)]
*  aggravated identity theft. Donald Trump community sentence in March Trump pardoned three co-founders [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=428.66s)]
*  of the crypto exchange BitMEX after they pleaded guilty last year. The Department of Justice says [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=434.18s)]
*  they quote willfully flouted US anti-money laundering laws. Same month he also pardoned [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=439.3s)]
*  Trevor Milton founder of electric vehicle startup who was sentenced to four years in prison for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  securities fraud. You might remember he's the guy whose electric car company Nicola shared a video [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=449.14s)]
*  of what purported to be its fully electric truck driving in Utah when in reality the prototype was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=454.74s)]
*  non-functional and had simply been pushed down a hill. Milton also happened to donate nearly [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=460.66s)]
*  $2 million to a Trump reelection fund late last year. Also in March Trump pardoned Brian Kelsley [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=467.46s)]
*  that's a former Tennessee Republican state senator who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=474.18s)]
*  campaign finance scheme. He claimed he was the target of a weaponized justice department under [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=478.5s)]
*  President Biden. In April Trump pardoned Nevada Republican Michelle Fiore a MAGA loyalist who [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=482.98s)]
*  was found guilty on wire fraud charges last year. Now what was her crime you ask? Well at trial [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=488.9s)]
*  prosecutor says she raised $70,000 to build a statue for a fallen police officer noble cause [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=493.62s)]
*  and then use some of the money on cosmetic surgery instead. Don't worry she got a pardon. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=501.62s)]
*  Yesterday Trump announced he would pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley the reality tv stars who are [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=507.06s)]
*  convicted on multiple counts of fraud and tax evasion. Just today Trump pardoned Michael Grimm [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=511.86s)]
*  remember that guy? Former Republican congressman Newsmax commentator who spent seven months in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=517.3s)]
*  prison a decade ago after pleading guilty to one count of tax crime. That is not to be clear an [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=522.58s)]
*  exhaustive list. Trump isn't done there. Today he was asked about pardoning the right-wing extremist [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=527.46s)]
*  convicted again before a jury of a plot to kidnap Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=533.5400000000001s)]
*  back in 2020. I'm gonna look at it I will take a look at it it's been brought to my attention. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  I did watch the trial it looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job I'll be honest with you [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=546.0200000000001s)]
*  it looked to me like some people said some stupid things you know they were drinking and I think they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=551.3s)]
*  said stupid things but I'll take a look at that and a lot of people are asking me that question [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=555.62s)]
*  from both sides actually. Oh from both sides. Do you think he watched the trial sitting there [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=561.06s)]
*  day after day watching the trial? Was that trial televised? The power of presidential pardon and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=568.9799999999999s)]
*  clemency is a really important one it's essential in the constitution it can be a very good thing [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=575.38s)]
*  and I want to be super clear here okay in most all presidencies of my lifetime that power has [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=579.94s)]
*  been woefully underused by presidents. People genuinely do get railroaded they really do end [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=587.3000000000001s)]
*  up with insane sentences that don't match their crimes but Donald Trump is not attempting to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=592.98s)]
*  redress systematic social injustice here right this is not a good faith effort he has decided [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=602.74s)]
*  that the purpose of the pardon is to protect people who are loyal to him. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=608.02s)]
*  For my friends everything for my enemies the law people that commit the kind of crimes he thinks [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=611.3s)]
*  are like not a big deal who cares tax evasion fraud what he wants to do I think it's pretty [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=616.02s)]
*  clear is effectively end white collar prosecution end white collar crime as a category whether [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=622.66s)]
*  through pardons or a dismantled department of justice and I gotta say aside from the just sheer [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=628.18s)]
*  corruption and moral obscenity of it all having lived through and covered the subprime mortgage [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=634.02s)]
*  crisis I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the combination of totally defanging white collar [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=640.18s)]
*  prosecution while deregulating and embracing the dodgiest parts of finance like crypto where [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=645.38s)]
*  there's billions of dollars sloshing around is not going to end well. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  you [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2Zo4Dsz_0&t=664.02s)]
