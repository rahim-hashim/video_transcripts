# Israel conducts 'preemptive strike' against Iran
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw)
*  All right, we are following the breaking news out of the Middle East right now in which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Israeli defense minister has alerted the nation to a set of what he called preemptive [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=4.0s)]
*  strikes against Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=8.44s)]
*  There have been explosions outside of Tehran according to the Iranian state authorities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=10.74s)]
*  We do not know yet where these strikes have been, how widespread they are, what facilities [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=15.4s)]
*  are they focused on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=21.6s)]
*  There would be in the eyes, I think, of the Iranian government a big difference between [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=22.88s)]
*  military strikes like those we've seen from Israel over the past six months in this escalating [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=27.22s)]
*  exchange of warfare with Israel and Iran and targeting the nuclear program. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=33.7s)]
*  Targeting the nuclear program with a strike has long been something the Israeli government [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=42.54s)]
*  has been dead set on and often been at odds with American administrations, including the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  Obama administration and the Biden administration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=50.78s)]
*  So I want to bring in now Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is a Democrat of Massachusetts, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=53.44s)]
*  and Senator, when we started this program 29 minutes ago, I was going to speak to you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=57.86s)]
*  about your colleague being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed, and I will speak to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=62.28s)]
*  you about that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=66.24s)]
*  But this seems to be possibly extraordinarily major development, depending on what happens. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=67.36s)]
*  I know you probably don't know any more details than we do, but I want to get your reaction [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=73.36s)]
*  to the idea that the Israelis just launched a preemptive strike on Iran. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=77.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  This is deeply disturbing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  And look, I don't agree often with the Trump administration, but I think here it is important [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=87.36s)]
*  to say we need more negotiation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=94.96s)]
*  We need de-escalation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=97.5s)]
*  We need to get to a deal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  This has the possibility of spinning entirely out of control. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=102.1s)]
*  So we need to get these parties back to a negotiating table. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=106.86s)]
*  We need the administration in there helping try to negotiate something among them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=111.56s)]
*  This is truly, truly a dangerous situation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=117.28s)]
*  I have to say this morning I had stupidly and foolishly expressed confidence that this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=121.56s)]
*  strike wouldn't happen today or tomorrow because the president's envoy, Steve Wittkopf, is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=127.2s)]
*  headed to Oman, the region, for diplomatic talks this Sunday. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this strikes me as a pretty shocking thing, given that context, for our ally Israel [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=138.4s)]
*  to do with the president's envoy headed to the region for diplomacy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=148.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=152.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=153.96s)]
*  You could not find a way for Benjamin Netanyahu to more aggressively say to Donald Trump, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=154.96s)]
*  to the Trump administration, but to the people of the United States of America. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=163.08s)]
*  I just don't care about you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=167.12s)]
*  I don't care that you are an ally. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  He wants to get out there and do what he wants to do. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=171.96s)]
*  And he's just going to do it, even as you rightly say, even with the envoy for negotiation [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=176.08s)]
*  already in the air and coming. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=182.68s)]
*  He didn't even call and say, send the guy back. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Don't send him here because I have other plans. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=187.52s)]
*  So this is a way not only for Netanyahu to take on Iran, it's a way for Netanyahu to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=191.1s)]
*  say to the whole rest of the world that this is not about alliances, this is not about [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  de-escalation, this is about Netanyahu doing what Netanyahu wants to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  And ultimately, not only does that put the entire world at risk, it certainly puts the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=207.94s)]
*  people of Israel at risk as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we should note, of course, the Israeli defense minister warning that there's an [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=215.5s)]
*  expectation of retaliation through missile and drone attacks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=218.7s)]
*  We saw missile and drone attacks in previous exchanges between the two nations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  Another question on this in just context, again, because we are trying to get the details [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=227.78s)]
*  and the details really matter here in terms of the scope of this, but the context here [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=230.64s)]
*  is that there was a deal with Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  It was negotiated. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=241.88s)]
*  It required monitoring of their enrichment capabilities. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  It limited their breakout time to get a weapon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=246.46s)]
*  That deal was negotiated by the Obama administration. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=249.12s)]
*  It was agreed to, and it was ripped up by the first Trump administration, which has, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=251.94s)]
*  it seems to me, brought us to this point. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that ripping up that deal was a mistake? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=259.82s)]
*  Oh, I think it was a terrible mistake. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=263.7s)]
*  And I said so at the time, as did many others. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=267.42s)]
*  We at least had some insight into, on a very regular basis, what Iran was up to. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=272.38s)]
*  We had an agreement from Iran on what it would not do by way of enrichment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=280.02s)]
*  And as you say, we could get, we were able to see what the breakout period was and to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=284.5s)]
*  keep that breakout period long enough that there would be genuine warning. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=293.06s)]
*  And when the Trump administration threw all that out the window, said, nope, don't want [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=298.22s)]
*  any part of that, we lost that capacity. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=303.1s)]
*  We lost the inspections that Iran had agreed to. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=307.12s)]
*  And that didn't make anybody safer. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=311.82000000000005s)]
*  It certainly didn't make Israel safer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  It didn't make the United States safer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=315.66s)]
*  It didn't make the world safer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=317.42s)]
*  It let Iran move within its own sphere and hide it from the rest of the world. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  That's what's been unfolding. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=325.86s)]
*  And I really do want to say I appreciate that the Trump administration now is trying to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=328.22s)]
*  negotiate. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  But we could have been in a lot better position on this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=334.94s)]
*  And now we are seeing the consequences of the Trump administration burning down the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  original negotiations. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  Senator, I'm definitely going to ask you about what happened today in California. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=345.38s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  And I want to keep you if that's okay. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry, we still are working through the details about exactly what happened. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=353.58s)]
*  We know now that there were airstrikes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  We are working on whether it was limited to airstrikes, though, or whether there may have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=373.58s)]
*  been other assets that were used in this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=378.46s)]
*  These strikes against Iran, we don't know if they have actually concluded at this point. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=381.18s)]
*  We know that they started more than an hour ago. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  There are strikes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=390.74s)]
*  It is a multiple strike package. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=391.74s)]
*  So why I bring that up is because as the rumors that something was likely to unfold in the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=394.58s)]
*  coming days were growing stronger over the last 48 hours or so, we were hearing a lot [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=399.41999999999996s)]
*  of talk about the possibility of limited strikes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=405.06s)]
*  It still appears that is the case, but definitely multiple. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=408.3s)]
*  The targets, we are still working on the details of that as well, but it is officials telling [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=412.06s)]
*  us that it's the kind of targets that we would expect. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  So that leads us to believe there may have been something that would in some way either [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=420.74s)]
*  disable or delay Iran's nuclear facilities or nuclear program. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=425.66s)]
*  That is what Israel has been, their goal has been militarily with Iran for as long as I [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  can remember. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=437.14s)]
*  We do have confirmation from multiple U.S. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=438.74s)]
*  officials that there was no U.S. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=440.94s)]
*  military involvement or assistance. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=442.38s)]
*  So why that's critical is we're talking about not U.S. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=444.9s)]
*  military involvement in the form of dropping bombs or anything, but no assistance means [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=448.18s)]
*  that the U.S. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=454.26s)]
*  military also didn't do things like help them with aerial refueling or even provide intelligence [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=455.26s)]
*  that may have helped. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=461.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, the U.S. and Israel has a strong intelligence sharing program that goes back decades. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=462.3s)]
*  So it is possible that in that program there was some kind of information that was shared [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=467.3s)]
*  that in some way aided this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=471.70000000000005s)]
*  But as far as this exact operation or exact mission, the officials telling us that in [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  fact the U.S. did not aid in that capacity. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=476.86s)]
*  You mentioned this comes, of course, as the United States and Iran seem to be getting [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  closer to some sort of a preliminary framework about a nuclear deal. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=485.22s)]
*  Obviously, that is something that Israel has been against. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=490.1s)]
*  They are they do not like the idea of a deal between the United States and Iran on their [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=493.66s)]
*  nuclear enrichment program. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=498.62s)]
*  But it's not just that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=500.22s)]
*  Another key timeline that we should keep in mind right now is back in October, Israel [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=501.42s)]
*  took a series of very successful strikes in Iran. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=506.46s)]
*  They largely disabled their strategic air defenses throughout the country. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=510.7s)]
*  What that means is their S-300s and their coordinated air defense systems. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=515.74s)]
*  They took out the radars. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=520.38s)]
*  Basically every one of their air defense systems, strategic air defenses, so the longer range [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=522.02s)]
*  ones were disabled. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=527.1s)]
*  Well, Iran can rebuild those and it takes a matter of months. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=528.54s)]
*  There's a very real possibility Israelis were looking at this and saying, look, our window [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=532.86s)]
*  for being able to more safely conduct manned strikes, fly over Iran without our pilots [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=536.62s)]
*  having exponentially more danger in the mission. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=542.38s)]
*  That window is closing and that may have also factored in here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=545.02s)]
*  Last question that I'm going to let you go, Courtney, so you can go back to reporting [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  this out. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=552.8599999999999s)]
*  But just to be clear on this, when you say, you know, there has been the threat of strikes [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=553.8599999999999s)]
*  on the nuclear facilities for a long time. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=557.74s)]
*  I mean, you know, literally over a decade. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=559.74s)]
*  It's something that's been contemplated and worn. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=562.02s)]
*  I've covered it for, again, over a decade. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=563.66s)]
*  When you say like you would have expected, my understanding from what I hear from you [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=566.9799999999999s)]
*  is there is an we don't have a confirmed expectation or anticipation that this might [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=569.86s)]
*  be what that is. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=574.66s)]
*  Yeah, like actually targeted at the nuclear facilities and program. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=576.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=580.26s)]
*  And that it's an excellent point. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=581.26s)]
*  But here's the one the one caution I would have about the possibility that Israel was [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=582.34s)]
*  really taking a massive series of strikes that would in some way dismantle or disable [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=586.3000000000001s)]
*  or even destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=591.78s)]
*  OK, that would be if it's Israel by themselves. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=594.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=598.02s)]
*  So other military participation and specifically the U.S. military participation, that is most [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=599.18s)]
*  likely going to be a multi day, possibly even a multi week operation for them to do that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=603.66s)]
*  The Israeli nuclear facility, excuse me, the Iranian nuclear facilities are buried deep [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=608.86s)]
*  underground. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=613.34s)]
*  It would take things like a massive ordinance penetrator, a bunker buster, right, to go [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=614.34s)]
*  through to take it out. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=618.18s)]
*  That's not something that the Israelis could do quickly. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=620.5s)]
*  What they could do is and what they have proven they can do back in October is show is Iran [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=622.62s)]
*  that, yeah, you know, we can take strikes right around your nuclear facilities. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=628.74s)]
*  We will hold them at risk. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=633.06s)]
*  We can do things like take out your air defenses. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=634.66s)]
*  You know, so what's what's still not clear is was this more than than, hey, we're showing [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=636.86s)]
*  you we can still do this amidst these nuclear negotiations, these negotiations with the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=643.38s)]
*  United States, or was this an attempt to further set the program back? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=646.86s)]
*  But as far as actually a mission to completely destroy their nuclear facilities, it doesn't [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=652.02s)]
*  appear that's what this is here tonight. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=657.34s)]
*  All right, Courtney, could be that was incredibly useful. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=658.34s)]
*  And thank you for your reporting. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=661.7s)]
*  I will let you get back to it right now. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJ7wHVFNdw&t=662.9s)]
