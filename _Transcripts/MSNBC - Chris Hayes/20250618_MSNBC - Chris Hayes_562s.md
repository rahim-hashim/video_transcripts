# 'MAGA civil war': See Ted Cruz and Tucker Carlson brawl over Iran
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw)
*  You don't know that I'm gonna even do it. You don't know. I may do it. I may not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=0.0s)]
*  do it. I mean nobody knows what I'm gonna do. I can tell you this that Iran's got [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=4.16s)]
*  a lot of trouble and they want to negotiate. Donald Trump is treating the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=9.6s)]
*  high-stakes questions of war and peace, life and death for millions of people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=15.48s)]
*  and nuclear armament like a reality show cliffhanger. It started this morning [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=19.48s)]
*  during this genuinely absurd flagpole stunt where he put out a long loving riff [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=24.76s)]
*  about how great the flagpole is and about how it's tapered and about how the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=29.6s)]
*  rope is inside the pole and then it continued a few hours ago in the Oval [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Office refusing to commit to anything teasing his big decision like a season [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=37.08s)]
*  finale has millions of lives hanging the balance. What will Donald Trump [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  unilaterally singularly do? What does the king want to do? But here's the thing in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=44.68s)]
*  many ways we are already associated with this war. He's already greenlit [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=50.24s)]
*  Israel's war in Iran with support one way or the other from the US. Wall Street [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=53.94s)]
*  Journal is now reporting quote, President Trump told senior aides last [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=58.56s)]
*  Tuesday he approved of attack plans for Iran but was holding off on giving the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=61.28s)]
*  final order to see if Tehran will abandon its nuclear program. Trump is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=65.16s)]
*  hoping that threatening to join Israel strikes on Iran will compel Tehran to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=68.98s)]
*  meet his demands. And that support and perhaps even direct involvement in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=73.4s)]
*  Israel's war has led to something of a rebellion in the MAGA base. You see [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was supposed to be a different kind of Republican. His big [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  surprise political triumph back in 2016 and in some ways continuing today has [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=87.36s)]
*  been the rebranding of the Republican Party from when it was his absolute [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=92.4s)]
*  lowest point because of what George W. Bush had done to it. A financial crisis, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=97.04s)]
*  bailouts, enormous tax cuts for the rich and perhaps most crucially a decade of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=102.12s)]
*  war in the Middle East, including a war in Iraq based on lies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=107.48s)]
*  As a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=111.84s)]
*  to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=118.28s)]
*  such weapons and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=123.08s)]
*  violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=130.32s)]
*  biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. I believe that Saddam [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=137.48s)]
*  Hussein is beginning giving aid and comfort training and assistance to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=143.32s)]
*  al Qaeda murderers that he has weapons of mass destruction. He is lying when he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  says he doesn't and he will never voluntarily disarm 500 inspectors, 5000 [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=151.88s)]
*  inspectors not gonna make him disarm. He is a danger to our country and the world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=157.56s)]
*  He has killed his own people and you're not gonna disarm him. But diplomacy is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=161.84s)]
*  gonna take force. That clip just almost gave me a rage stroke. I haven't seen [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=166.48s)]
*  that one in a while. Those lies and that war defined the Republican Party in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=171.44s)]
*  some ways for a generation, which is partly why it felt too many within the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=176.32s)]
*  Republican Party. I mean, the base of the party like a breath of fresh air when [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump ripped into Jeb Bush, who was trying to rehabilitate his brother's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=183.72s)]
*  legacy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=188.48s)]
*  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big fat mistake. All right, now you can take it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=189.16s)]
*  anywhere you want. And it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=196.76s)]
*  beginning of his announcement when he announced the president, took him five [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  days. He went back. It was a mistake. It wasn't a mistake. Took him five days [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  before his people told him what to say. And he ultimately said it was a mistake. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=208.88s)]
*  The war in Iraq. We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives. We don't even have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=214.0s)]
*  it. Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=218.84s)]
*  world. Obviously, it was a mistake. Boy, he does seem mentally sharper there, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=222.76s)]
*  doesn't he? Now that posture, along with some rhetorical noise against the so [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=227.12s)]
*  called globalists and, you know, Goldman Sachs and Lloyd Blankfein created a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=231.4s)]
*  very successful rebranding. But a decade later, here we are. What has actually [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=235.6s)]
*  changed? George W Bush's domestic policy was an enormous tax cut for the rich [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=240.88s)]
*  and cuts to the social safety net for everyone else. His foreign policy was [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=246.72s)]
*  reckless wars of choice in the Middle East. While Donald Trump's domestic [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  policy is a huge tax cut for the rich and cuts to the social safety net for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=254.24s)]
*  everyone else. And his foreign policy is looking a lot like reckless war of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=258.8s)]
*  choice in the Middle East. In some cases, the exact same people are out of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  the game, lobbying the president directly through his favorite TV shows. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=267.6s)]
*  I would like to see this regime fall, but I'm gonna leave it up to the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=272.6s)]
*  president as to what to do and when to do it. But I do know this. If we [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=276.02s)]
*  don't take out their nuclear program now, we'll all regret it. We're very [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  close. Be all in Mr President and helping Israel finish the job. Honestly, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=284.02s)]
*  if we ever even got into a conflict with Iran, it would be over within two [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=289.38s)]
*  days. If that there's a theory, no Middle East Wars and then there's an [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  enemy we've had since 1979. They killed our people directly. They have had [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=298.94s)]
*  blood on our hands since 1979. They've never paid the price for 52 hostages. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=302.9s)]
*  I'm a warmonger because I think that these seventh century primitive [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=307.4s)]
*  barbarians with 21st century technology should be removed. An Islamo Nazi [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  regime with a nuclear warhead, intercontinental missiles that have [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=318.67999999999995s)]
*  threatened to assassinate the president of the United States. Gee, and we have [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  morons, fools running around the country. This isn't magna. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=326.02s)]
*  This isn't magna. This isn't what I voted for. By all appearances, those [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=330.94s)]
*  Iran hawks seem to be winning the Maga Civil War. New York Times reporting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=335.54s)]
*  Trump is shaping his foreign policy specifically in response to the dulcet [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=339.5s)]
*  towns of Mark Levin. But there is a not so small contingent of the Maga base, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=345.02s)]
*  a big one, I think generationally the young folks that appears to feel [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=349.82s)]
*  genuinely snookered by all this. And I'm not talking about like rhino pushovers, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=354.14s)]
*  but died in the wool, Maga faithful like disgraced former cable news host and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=358.5s)]
*  frequent Trump ass kisser Tucker Carlson and even Trump's own former top [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=364.38s)]
*  advisor and campaign chairman Steve Bannon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=370.14s)]
*  I actually really love Trump. He's a deeply humane, kind person. And I am [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=374.62s)]
*  saying this because I'm really afraid that my country is going to be further [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=380.34s)]
*  weakened by this. It's also going to end, I believe, Trump's presidency and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=386.22s)]
*  effectively end it. I knew Bush, I knew George W. Bush, we had, you know, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=390.38000000000005s)]
*  family connections to Bush. I knew Bush. Personally, I still see Bush sometimes. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=394.1s)]
*  And, you know, of course, he hates me. And he does because I criticized him on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=398.98s)]
*  Iraq. And that war is the sum total from historical perspective of his [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=405.54s)]
*  administration. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  If we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like it's going to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=411.5s)]
*  happen on the combat side, it's going to not just blow up the coalition. It's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=415.98s)]
*  also going to thwart what we're doing with the most important thing, which is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=420.42s)]
*  the deportation of the illegal alien invaders that are here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=424.18s)]
*  Ah, yes, yes, yes. Don't start a new war in the Middle East. We have to focus on [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=428.22s)]
*  terrorizing 13 million neighbors of ours. Last night, that Maga Civil War was on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=432.38s)]
*  full display for all to see in a Tucker Carlson interview with Warhawk podcaster [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=437.9s)]
*  and occasional senator, Ted Cruz of Texas. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  How many people live around, by the way? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know the population at all. No, I don't know the population. You don't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=448.34s)]
*  know the population of the country you seek to topple. How many people living [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=453.17999999999995s)]
*  around? 92 million. Okay. Yeah. How could you not know that? I don't sit around [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=457.9s)]
*  memorizing population tables. Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=464.62s)]
*  for the overthrow of the government. Why is it relevant? Whether it's 90 million [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=468.26s)]
*  or 80 million or 100 million? Why is that relevant? Because if you don't know [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=472.22s)]
*  anything about the country... I didn't say I don't know anything about the country. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=474.58s)]
*  Okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=476.7s)]
*  They are Persians and predominantly Shia. Okay, this is... No, you don't know [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=479.86s)]
*  anything about Iran. So, actually the country... Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=484.7s)]
*  expert on Iran who says... You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=488.86s)]
*  government and you don't know anything about the country. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=492.42s)]
*  The dirty little secret of Trumpism and the MAGA movement and the current [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=499.82s)]
*  Republican Party and its trajectory really over the last 20 years is that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=503.82s)]
*  behind all the rhetoric, when you actually look at what are they doing, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=506.58000000000004s)]
*  right, what are the actual policies? So many of the actual policies are just the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=510.26s)]
*  same reheated platform that Republicans have been pushing for as long as I've [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=515.1s)]
*  covered politics. It sounds like some folks are finally getting the memo. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=520.34s)]
*  Tonight, there's an ongoing effort to recruit Republicans to help block Trump [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  from entering Israel's war with Iran. And the man leading that charge joins me [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  next. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  you [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz33wwS2Eaw&t=550.34s)]
