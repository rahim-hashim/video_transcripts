# 'Why the hell did you vote for the bill?': GOP senator slammed for megabill whiplash
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, there's a meme I see on the Internet all the time. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=2.0s)]
*  You might have seen it too. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=4.0s)]
*  It is a post by the satirical social media outfit [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=6.0s)]
*  cousin of the onion called Clickhole. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=9.0s)]
*  And it's a photo of this very serious looking man [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=11.0s)]
*  with the headline, Heartbreaking. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=14.0s)]
*  The worst person you know just made a great point. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=16.0s)]
*  On social media, this can indeed be heartbreaking. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=19.0s)]
*  It can be heartbreaking in real life. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=22.0s)]
*  And that post has taken on a life of its own [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=24.0s)]
*  over the last few years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=27.0s)]
*  So every time someone that folks really don't agree with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=29.0s)]
*  suddenly shows up on their side of the issue, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=32.0s)]
*  well, this poor guy gets his photo posted. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=34.0s)]
*  A few years back, reporters actually tracked down the man [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=37.0s)]
*  pictured in that stock photo that had become a meme. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=40.0s)]
*  Turns out he's a Spanish marketing specialist [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=43.0s)]
*  who has eventually made peace with becoming an online icon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=46.0s)]
*  And seven years after his first appearance, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=50.0s)]
*  man, that guy's face is getting a real workout. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=53.0s)]
*  As plenty of the worst people you know have been making [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=56.0s)]
*  some very good points about Trump, say, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=59.0s)]
*  ordering the bombing of Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=61.0s)]
*  From Matt Gaetz to Marjorie Taylor Greene to Tucker Carlson [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=63.0s)]
*  taking Ted Cruz out to the woodshed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=67.0s)]
*  President Trump knows that the Bush era doctrine [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=70.0s)]
*  of regime change wars in the Middle East is foolish. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=73.0s)]
*  The American people have been brainwashed into believing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=76.0s)]
*  that America has to engage in these foreign wars [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=80.0s)]
*  in order for us to survive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=84.0s)]
*  You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=86.0s)]
*  How many people live in Iran? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=90.0s)]
*  92 million. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=92.0s)]
*  You don't know anything about Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=93.0s)]
*  I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=95.0s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling to the overthrow of the government. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=98.0s)]
*  This week, we've got a new contender. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=102.0s)]
*  The world's richest man and Trump's former political benefactor [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=105.0s)]
*  Elon Musk railing against Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=108.0s)]
*  a bill that is almost suicidally self-destructive to America's future. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=113.0s)]
*  A bill that is right now, as I speak to you, on the verge of becoming law [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=118.0s)]
*  after passing the Senate today on a 50-50 tie [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=122.0s)]
*  that was broken by Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=126.0s)]
*  On and off over the past month, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=129.0s)]
*  Musk has blasted the bill as fiscally irresponsible, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=131.0s)]
*  full of insane pork that is damaging to America's future. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=134.0s)]
*  Last weekend, as the Senate hurriedly marked up their version of the bill, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=137.0s)]
*  including a provision that kills subsidies for solar and wind energy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=142.0s)]
*  while boosting coal and oil, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=146.0s)]
*  Musk posted to social media, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=148.0s)]
*  the latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=150.0s)]
*  and cause immense strategic harm to our country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=154.0s)]
*  Utterly insane and destructive, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=158.0s)]
*  it gives handouts to industries of the past [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=160.0s)]
*  while severely damaging industries of the future. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=163.0s)]
*  And cue our bald Spanish friend. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=166.0s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=169.0s)]
*  Heartbreaking indeed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=171.0s)]
*  Musk even threatened to form a new political party [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=173.0s)]
*  and to unseat Republicans who vote for the bill against their own stated principles. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=176.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=180.0s)]
*  Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=181.0s)]
*  and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=184.0s)]
*  should hang their head in shame, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=187.0s)]
*  and they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this earth. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=189.0s)]
*  Now, we should be clear here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=194.0s)]
*  Musk is also mad because the bill does away with a big subsidy on electric car purchases [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=195.0s)]
*  which, by the way, is good policy, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=200.0s)]
*  but also his car company Tesla relies on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=202.0s)]
*  It's not like he's suddenly a good guy here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=206.0s)]
*  Remember, he was the Doge founder. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=208.0s)]
*  He was running around cutting things like biomedical research, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=210.0s)]
*  cancer research, and USAID leading to deaths, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=213.0s)]
*  almost too many to count. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=217.0s)]
*  That said, again, cue our meme dude [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=220.0s)]
*  what he's saying about the irresponsibility of the Trump bill, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=223.0s)]
*  especially about its totally backwards, self-defeating energy agenda, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=227.0s)]
*  is completely correct. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=232.0s)]
*  The worst person you know just made a great point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=234.0s)]
*  And Trump, for his part, is not happy with Musk's criticisms. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=237.0s)]
*  Go back and eat, Elon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=256.0s)]
*  He's not going to get his mandate, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=258.0s)]
*  and he better be careful because he might not get anything else. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=260.0s)]
*  You know what that means, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=264.0s)]
*  Also, just to complete the full circle here, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=267.0s)]
*  Trump is right that Doge is a monster, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=269.0s)]
*  also right that Musk relies on a lot of federal dollars, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=271.0s)]
*  something that all of us were pointing out for months [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=275.0s)]
*  as Donald Trump was touting what a great job Elon was doing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=278.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=282.0s)]
*  The way I understand it is the Trump administration [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=283.0s)]
*  and the Trump presidency is so rife with so many bad ideas [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=285.0s)]
*  in so many directions that every day they're always turning [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=288.0s)]
*  some of the world's worst people into sensible-sounding critics [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=291.0s)]
*  by the sheer madness of their undertakings. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=295.0s)]
*  This big, ugly bill is no exception. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=299.0s)]
*  I mean, it really is just astoundingly terrible in every direction, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=302.0s)]
*  gobsmacking. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=306.0s)]
*  It doesn't just take the country backwards in terms of energy policy, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=308.0s)]
*  although that might be the most crucial civilizational challenge we face. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=310.0s)]
*  It enshrines trillions of massive tax cuts [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=315.0s)]
*  that primarily benefit rich people and corporations, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=318.0s)]
*  also benefit people who inherit estates over $50 million, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=321.0s)]
*  very important constituency, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=324.0s)]
*  and that is financed only in part by devastating cuts to health care [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=326.0s)]
*  and food assistance for poor and working-class Americans. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=330.0s)]
*  Depending on the estimate you listen to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=334.0s)]
*  and the iteration of the bill that you're looking at, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=336.0s)]
*  we'll see in the final analysis, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=338.0s)]
*  something between $12 or $17 million could lose health care, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=340.0s)]
*  according to the Congressional Budget Office. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=343.0s)]
*  Hospitals will be defunded. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=346.0s)]
*  And even with those cuts, even with those cuts, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=348.0s)]
*  the bill adds more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=351.0s)]
*  also according to CBO. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=354.0s)]
*  The other thing you should know about this bill is that no one is buying it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=356.0s)]
*  This isn't one of those situations where they've pulled off some massive, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=361.0s)]
*  you know, successful hoodwinking. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=364.0s)]
*  It is wildly unpopular. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=366.0s)]
*  And then when people are pulled on its actual substantive provisions, right, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=369.0s)]
*  like here's what the bill does, the giveaways to billionaires, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=373.0s)]
*  the hits to programs for the poor, the sick, and the elderly, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=376.0s)]
*  it pulls even worse. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=378.0s)]
*  Right now, this truly toxic agenda, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=381.0s)]
*  both in the politics and the merits, is being held together [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=384.0s)]
*  through the sheer force of an institutional Republican Party [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=386.0s)]
*  devoted to the plutocrats [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=390.0s)]
*  and Trump's ability to bully party members into submission. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=393.0s)]
*  If you've been following the fight over the bill, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=397.0s)]
*  you will find oddly sensible statements from far-right Republicans [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=399.0s)]
*  over the bill's fiscal irresponsibility, which it is. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=403.0s)]
*  It will blow up the deficit, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=405.0s)]
*  and that might actually have some really negative consequences [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=407.0s)]
*  given where we are with interest rates. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=409.0s)]
*  You'll see people blasting it from the center over its draconian cuts to services. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=411.0s)]
*  I mean, here's the thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=416.0s)]
*  The bill is so bad that even the person who provided [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=418.0s)]
*  the crucial vote today, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=421.0s)]
*  like the one singular vote that made this thing pass out of the Senate, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=423.0s)]
*  can't defend it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=428.0s)]
*  She knows it's bad. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=429.0s)]
*  Here's Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=431.0s)]
*  Do I like this bill? No. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=435.0s)]
*  Because I try to take care of Alaska's interests. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=437.0s)]
*  But I know, I know that in many parts of the country, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=441.0s)]
*  there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=447.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=452.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a sitting Senator defending the bill by saying, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=454.0s)]
*  do I like this bill, question mark, no. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=461.0s)]
*  Today, Murkowski even told reporters off camera, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=465.0s)]
*  she doesn't actually want the version of the bill that she voted for to become law [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=468.0s)]
*  and hopes the House undoes some of the damage in the bill that she [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=473.0s)]
*  and her fellow senators did. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=477.0s)]
*  Democrats understandably pounced on that statement. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=479.0s)]
*  Listen to this quote from Senator Murkowski, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=483.0s)]
*  who just caved and voted for this bill. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=486.0s)]
*  And you got to love this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=488.0s)]
*  She said, quote, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=489.0s)]
*  my hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=490.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=495.0s)]
*  I mean, my question to her is, if you really believe that, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=496.0s)]
*  then why the hell did you vote for this bill? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=500.0s)]
*  Republicans are still voting for this toxic agenda, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=505.0s)]
*  this toxic MAGA Republican agenda. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=509.0s)]
*  Even when they know and will articulate openly it's bad for Americans. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=512.0s)]
*  Josh Hawley wrote an op-ed that said it's bad to cut Medicaid. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=516.0s)]
*  And then when he voted for the bill was like, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=519.0s)]
*  we got to have a serious conversation about how bad it is to cut Medicaid. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=521.0s)]
*  The only silver lining, and it's a real one, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=526.0s)]
*  is that voters do seem to be paying attention. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=529.0s)]
*  They are mad and they are poised to force Republicans to answer for their votes on this one. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=531.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtdBxa0J7A&t=559.0s)]
