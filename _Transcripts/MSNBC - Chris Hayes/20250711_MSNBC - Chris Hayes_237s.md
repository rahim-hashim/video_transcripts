Video Description: “Donald Trump continues to blame his failure to prepare for and react to extreme weather on forces beyond anyone's control. Rather than actually plan ahead, he tries to pass it off like it’s just completely unforeseeable. He does it every single time,” says Chris Hayes, adding that climate experts have been warning us.

# Chris Hayes: ‘Start planning for the unexpected’
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ)
*  The tragedy continues to unfold in Texas where at least 128 people have died, at least 166 are still missing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was on the ground there today, torring the damage, and probably due to the many reports questioning the speed and efficacy of the federal response. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Just tonight, the New York Times reports FEMA didn't answer thousands of calls from flood survivors. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=16.16s)]
*  Two days after catastrophic floods roared through central Texas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not answer nearly two-thirds of its calls to its disaster assistance line. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=22.08s)]
*  The lack of responsiveness happened, listen to this, because the agency had fired hundreds of contractors at call centers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=32.56s)]
*  That seems like a pretty huge screw-up. Tough to explain your way out of. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=40.0s)]
*  So of course, Donald Trump relies on his tried and true strategy of, nobody could have seen this coming. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  They could say it's a hundred year, somebody said it's a 500 year event, we're not going to let a thing like this happen again where it can wreak this kind of devastation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  It's easy to sit back and say, oh what could have happened here or there, you know, maybe we could have done something differently. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=61.2s)]
*  This was a thing that has never happened before, nobody's ever seen anything, I've never seen anything like this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=67.12s)]
*  A 500 year event that nobody's ever seen before, it's a big number, but DHS Secretary Kristi Noem knows an even bigger number. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  I believe this is an unprecedented event. I haven't heard in my knowledge, no of a flood that happened like this before. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=82.08s)]
*  So, you know, in our experience we know that it's at least a one in one thousand year flood that hit this area. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, one in one thousand, five hundred thousand, regardless of the number, the point is clear. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=99.44s)]
*  Donald Trump and his administration have never seen the risk of dangerous extreme weather coming, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=104.24s)]
*  and that's something he has made very clear since his first term. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=108.8s)]
*  There's nothing left, it's been wiped out, nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=112.8s)]
*  Somebody said it was like a very wide, but you mean extremely wide tornado, nobody's seen anything like this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=118.0s)]
*  The winds are 85 miles an hour, nobody's ever seen anything like it, but 150 mile an hour was up to 185 at one point. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=124.24s)]
*  I don't know that we've ever seen that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=131.04s)]
*  Two days ago there was water like nobody's ever seen before, I guess in the history of our country we've never had an amount of water like we've had. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=133.68s)]
*  This is a tough hurricane, one of the wettest we've ever seen from the standpoint of water. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=141.6s)]
*  Donald Trump continues to blame his failure to prepare for and react to extreme weather on forces beyond anyone's control. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=148.72s)]
*  Rather than actually plan ahead, he tries to pass it off like it's just completely unforeseeable. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  He does it every single time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  But for decades, scientists have been warning that carbon pollution is heating the planet and causing more frequent and more destructive extreme weather. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=163.52s)]
*  I've been covering this issue for half my adult life, constant warning that we're warming the planet to dangerous levels. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=172.16s)]
*  And so it's not at all surprising or unforeseeable that as the New York Times writes, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=178.48s)]
*  in data that goes back to 1910, nine of the top 10 extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995, according to the APA. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=183.04s)]
*  Why do you think that is? Just the roll of the dice? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=194.16s)]
*  The clear message is that floods like these are going to happen again and they're going to happen more and they're going to be worse. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=198.8s)]
*  So maybe it's time to massively shift to carbon-free energy and start planning for the unexpected no one could see coming. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06c8aR2ZBdQ&t=204.72s)]
