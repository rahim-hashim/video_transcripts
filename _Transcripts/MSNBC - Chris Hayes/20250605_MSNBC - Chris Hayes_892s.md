# See live-action replay of Trump-Elon feud: Hayes and Wagner act out 'messy breakup'
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q)
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Well well well, what a day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=3.0s)]
*  Today we witness perhaps the messiest public breakup personally I've ever seen, certainly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=5.36s)]
*  the messiest public breakup I've ever covered. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=9.96s)]
*  Now, we all knew this was coming. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=12.52s)]
*  I'm not sure we knew it would be quite so real house-wise of our logo, but everyone [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=15.16s)]
*  knew it was only a matter of time before Donald Trump and Elon Musk broke up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=19.44s)]
*  How many Scaramoochies do we think that Donald will let pass before his ego can no longer [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=26.96s)]
*  tolerate the adoration and authority of his co-president? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=31.04s)]
*  There's only room for one narcissistic billionaire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=35.08s)]
*  This is not exactly the most stable bromance. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=39.08s)]
*  Ego the size of President Trump and Elon Musk and how that, can that last? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=42.64s)]
*  I keep wondering when this bromance between Trump and Elon Musk is going to blow up like [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=48.0s)]
*  a SpaceX rocket. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, the 327 day whirlwind political romance between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, which [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  started with Musk's full endorsement the day Trump was almost assassinated in Butler, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=63.08s)]
*  Pennsylvania and went through nearly $290 million of spending to get Trump back in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=67.92s)]
*  White House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=72.84s)]
*  Through weird rally appearances, his controversial, say the least, inauguration salute, he did [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  that twice, remember. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=79.84s)]
*  His chainsaw days leading Doge, the embarrassing state election loss in Wisconsin and just [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=81.24s)]
*  so much more. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=85.56s)]
*  Now, to be clear here, all of it has resulted in untold damage to the functioning of our [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=86.56s)]
*  federal government, to the lives of millions of people both in our country and around the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=92.24s)]
*  world, some of the poorest people in the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=97.0s)]
*  Not to mention the trashing of Musk's own brand and the real devastation to his signature [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=99.28s)]
*  business. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=104.88s)]
*  But now, well, things have gotten really messy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=105.88s)]
*  See, it started last Friday when his time in government had expired. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  With a literal black eye, Musk was given a fond Oval Office farewell as news reports [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=112.28s)]
*  about his drug use and quotes like, nobody liked the guy, were showing up in the papers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=117.08s)]
*  A few days later, Elon Musk began attacking, criticizing Trump and his signature big, beautiful [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=122.36s)]
*  bill as a, quote, pork-filled, disgusting abomination that Republicans should be ashamed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=128.04s)]
*  of voting for and should be replaced and kill the bill. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=133.88s)]
*  Sounds of kill the bill. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, through it all, Trump stayed somewhat uncharacteristically quiet, although we all [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=140.28s)]
*  knew that wasn't going to last. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=144.56s)]
*  This is not the most emotionally regulated individual we've ever encountered. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=146.72s)]
*  So it came up today in the Oval Office and, well, here's what happened. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=151.16s)]
*  I can understand why he's upset. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=155.48s)]
*  Remember, he was here for a long time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=157.28s)]
*  You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval Desk. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=159.88s)]
*  And even with a black eye, I said, do you want a little makeup? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=165.68s)]
*  We'll get you a little makeup. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=168.72s)]
*  But he said, no, I don't think so, which is interesting and very nice. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=170.4s)]
*  He wants to be who he is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=175.28s)]
*  So you could make that statement too, I guess. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=176.72s)]
*  Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=179.12s)]
*  I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=182.24s)]
*  anybody sitting here, better than you people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=187.88s)]
*  He knew everything about it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=190.48s)]
*  He had no problem with it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=191.48s)]
*  All of a sudden, he had a problem. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=192.48s)]
*  And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=194.36s)]
*  the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=197.16s)]
*  And it really is unfair. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=201.0s)]
*  I'm very disappointed in Elon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=202.28s)]
*  I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=203.88s)]
*  People leave my administration and they love us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  And then at some point, they miss it so badly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=211.56s)]
*  And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=214.56s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=219.08s)]
*  It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=220.08s)]
*  Now after Trump unloaded his feelings about Musk in the Oval, the whole thing was honestly [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=223.52s)]
*  just getting started and spilled out into the public arena of the, this is just perfect, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=229.44s)]
*  dueling social media platforms owned by these squabbling rich guys. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=234.2s)]
*  And it got so messy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=240.24s)]
*  I don't know if you were following this during the day. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  I suspect some of you are. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=244.36s)]
*  But I can't possibly describe you all by myself. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  So I brought in my good friend, Alex Wagner, who's going to help me to go through a blow [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=248.56s)]
*  by blow of what happened next. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  Alex, how are you? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  It's the role of a lifetime, Chris. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=256.16s)]
*  Were you as wrapped watching this unfold? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=257.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=259.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=260.04s)]
*  You're going to, I want you to do, so this, so we've now let it with Trump fires off his [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=261.04s)]
*  shot in the Oval Office. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=264.2s)]
*  We got the next salvo. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=265.58000000000004s)]
*  This comes from Musk. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=267.36s)]
*  Elon Musk on X at 12, 19 PM. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=271.76s)]
*  EV solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil and gas subsidies are touched. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=272.76s)]
*  Very unfair, but ditch the mountain of disgusting pork in the bill. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=278.0s)]
*  In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that is both big [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=282.56s)]
*  and beautiful. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  Everyone knows this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, one of the things I have to say about this, and this will be a theme in this exchange [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  all day is there's a lot of they're both right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=293.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=296.68s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that like, it's like all of a sudden Trump has discovered that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=297.68s)]
*  Elon Musk has some conflicts that maybe he wasn't just there because he thought Trump [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=300.64s)]
*  was an American here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=305.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=306.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=307.84s)]
*  That's something to do with business interests, billions and billions of dollars. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=308.84s)]
*  Government contract, government regulation, government investigation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=311.2s)]
*  Like it's so wild for those of us who've been sitting on this side of the camera being like, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=314.12s)]
*  it hasn't been a secret to anybody, but maybe Donald Trump. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=321.44s)]
*  It's totally corrupt to let this guy out. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=322.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=323.44s)]
*  So then, so then the, so must then responsive, the clip that we just played with Trump saying [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=324.44s)]
*  he's seen the bill. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=328.36s)]
*  And that Trump is disappointed in Elon and Musk says at 1225 PM false. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=329.48s)]
*  This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=334.8s)]
*  that almost no one in Congress could even read it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=339.72s)]
*  Again, he does have a point there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=342.12s)]
*  Eight hours between when the bill was released and when it was voted on a self-imposed deadline [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=343.44s)]
*  by the House Republican Conference and own goal of their own spectacular fabrication. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=347.36s)]
*  Again, a theme that will emerge here in this exchange. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  1244 PM Elon Musk tweeting, retweeting a tweet about Donald Trump's earlier statements [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=355.36s)]
*  railing against deficits and pushing for balanced budgets. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk writes, where is this guy today? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=365.44s)]
*  By the way, not a bad hundred percent clean hit hundred percent clean hit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  It is tweet after tweet about how insane it is to blow up the deficits. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=372.72s)]
*  We need a balanced budget. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=376.6s)]
*  What about deficits? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  What about the debt? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  What about the debt ceiling? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Like tweet after tweet after tweet. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  And let me just say the weirdness of this, that Donald Trump is now the person on the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  inside defending a bloated federal government or whatever it's being called. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=385.4s)]
*  And Elon Musk is the rabble rouser on the outside. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=390.0s)]
*  One 38 PM. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=392.4s)]
*  Elon Musk wistfully retweeting a picture of Trump outside the White House looking at a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=393.88s)]
*  Tesla and says, remember this at real Donald Trump. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  Anybody who's ever broken up with anybody knows that feeling where you're so angry, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  you're so angry. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=406.4s)]
*  And then you remember for a minute why you love that person. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=407.4s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=409.96s)]
*  It's just this was by the way, this was the famous Tesla showcase on the day that the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=411.08s)]
*  stock went down. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, he seems this is a very emo tweet here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  Remember how we used to love each other. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=421.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  And then Trump says, so Trump responds, Elon was wearing thin and classic Trump quotation [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  marks. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  I asked him to leave. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  I took away his Evie mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  that he knew for months I was going to do. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=434.12s)]
*  And he just went crazy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=435.84s)]
*  At 2 48 PM, Elon retweets a tweet about the wearing thin, wearing thin and the fact that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=439.04s)]
*  Trump asked Elon to leave the White House. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=447.92s)]
*  Elon writes such an obvious lie. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=451.24s)]
*  So sad. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=454.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=455.2s)]
*  Then now here comes another this again, another one where Donald Trump has a point here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=456.2s)]
*  Trump says the easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=461.56s)]
*  is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=465.16s)]
*  I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it again. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=468.52s)]
*  We have been saying this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=471.8s)]
*  We've been screaming this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=473.6s)]
*  And he has billions of dollars of government contracts, billions and billions of dollars [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=475.04s)]
*  of contracts. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=479.24s)]
*  And ultimately, this is the biggest hammer, I think, that Trump has to throw with Elon [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=480.24s)]
*  at Elon in all in the course of all of this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=484.8s)]
*  What strikes me as odd is that Elon ever took the position that getting rid of the Evie [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=487.2s)]
*  mandates would be bad, OK for his company, given the analysis that says he may lose as [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=490.64s)]
*  much as one point two billion dollars in profit at Tesla. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=495.76s)]
*  Things take a turn for the deeply emotional and highly controversial shortly after this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, we just keep in mind that what has just happened is he's saying, I'm going to I'm [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  going to come after your company. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=509.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=510.84s)]
*  Which is a red line. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=511.84s)]
*  And Elon volleys back at three twenty p.m. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=513.92s)]
*  Retweeting a post. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=518.04s)]
*  He had a tweet. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=520.88s)]
*  He had sent just a few moments earlier. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=522.08s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=524.36s)]
*  At real, Donald Trump is in the Epstein files as in Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=526.28s)]
*  That is the real reason they have not been made public. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=530.32s)]
*  Have a nice day, D.J.T. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=532.72s)]
*  Elon retweets that and says, Mark, this post for the future, the truth will come out. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=534.92s)]
*  By the way, like, again, this is one of these things where everyone's looking worse and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=540.36s)]
*  worse, as is often the case with us. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=544.56s)]
*  Like, oh, he's in the Epstein. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=546.28s)]
*  That's why like you're you're bringing your kid around the Oval Office all the time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=548.04s)]
*  Like, you knew this and didn't say anything like and and Trump turning around saying, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=551.0s)]
*  oh, the you know, the way to cut the budget is Elon's contracts. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  Like, well, that was true before he had a falling out with it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=559.72s)]
*  And were you thinking that all along? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=562.2s)]
*  Were you thinking that the person that you were bringing your child around to was a sexual [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=563.76s)]
*  predator allegedly and the person that you were hanging out with was actually the architect [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=567.44s)]
*  of fiscal despair for the United States of America? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=572.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=574.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=575.88s)]
*  And it's like, again, no one. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=576.88s)]
*  What's so striking here, aside from like the sort of delightful messiness, no one's even [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=578.12s)]
*  pretending anymore to have the public in mind. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=583.36s)]
*  Like, oh, do they know it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  It's there's no one is pretending that anyone cares about like the American people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=588.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=595.12s)]
*  We can hear you guys. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=596.6s)]
*  So then Trump says, I don't mind, Elon, turning against me, but he should have done so months [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=597.72s)]
*  ago. This is one of the greatest bills ever presented to Congress. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=601.5200000000001s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  I didn't create this mess. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm just here to fix it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=605.6s)]
*  This puts our country in a path of greatness. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=606.52s)]
*  All caps make America great again. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  To which at four or nine p.m., Elon responds, in light of the president's statement about [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=610.24s)]
*  the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  spacecraft immediately, which, if I'm correct, Chris would strand the four astronauts who [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=619.24s)]
*  are on the International Space Station. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=623.28s)]
*  Yes, to be clear, to be clear. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=624.68s)]
*  And also, and this is something that people raised alarms about with Elon Musk during [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=626.72s)]
*  the Biden years, the US space program has become. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=631.04s)]
*  Insanely dependent on this one guy, which, again, as these guys are going back and forth [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  in this juvenile. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  Performance of extremely cringe inducing versions of masculinity, put it that way, that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=643.48s)]
*  this is one of the cards that Elon has. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=648.92s)]
*  Yes, this is why this matters. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  This is why this is more than just like an unfortunate series of text exchanges. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=652.8399999999999s)]
*  This is why this has not the way we're not done for 11 p.m. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=660.12s)]
*  Elon retweets a tweet that says President versus Elon, who wins? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  My money's on Elon. Trump should be impeached and J.D. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  Vance should replace him. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=671.96s)]
*  Elon tweets. Yes. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=673.24s)]
*  Yeah. OK. OK. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=675.0s)]
*  Impish Trump. An interesting theory. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=675.96s)]
*  I like I do like for the sheer messiness of it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=677.76s)]
*  I do like dragging J.D. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  Vance into it, of course, against his will, who now has to have a position on good. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=681.8000000000001s)]
*  Why? We would love to hear what he has to say. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=685.44s)]
*  15 minutes later, Elon tweets, the Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=688.3599999999999s)]
*  half of this year. Nostradamus, which again, predicting probably something that it's [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  but also quite likely. Why didn't you say like where were you now? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=696.3599999999999s)]
*  Now you're telling me where were you last week? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=700.64s)]
*  Four forty three p.m. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=704.4799999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk tweeting what I'll call the eyebrow raise emoji in 1992. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=705.5999999999999s)]
*  Trump partied with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=710.56s)]
*  Just going to leave this here. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=712.56s)]
*  It's a retweet of a video from MSNBC with Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=713.8399999999999s)]
*  Could I just say I love the fact that there's just this playing right there. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=718.56s)]
*  The MSNBC video bug is burned in there like, yeah, no kidding. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=721.24s)]
*  We have been covering this. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  I did a whole bit during the campaign about if you were a single issue, Jeffrey [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  Epstein voter, that you had one candidate, which was Biden and Kamala Harris, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=731.92s)]
*  who were the only ones who had nothing. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=736.56s)]
*  R.F.K. was like, yeah, I was on the Epstein plane a few times. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=738.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's like, oh, here's the video of us partying together. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=741.56s)]
*  And my quote to New York magazine about like, he likes him young. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=743.92s)]
*  But again, it's nice to see our content, America, MSNBC bug burned in there [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=748.5999999999999s)]
*  getting out there. The things we've been talking about turns out true. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  And finally, is it time to create Musk tweets? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=758.1199999999999s)]
*  Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=761.04s)]
*  the 80 percent in the middle? Yes or no. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=764.2399999999999s)]
*  So here there's a lot to say about this. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=767.64s)]
*  First of all, let's just you know, we all have to live in this world. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, we do, Chris. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=773.56s)]
*  I know, but it's and it's not been fun, but it's nice to have a day. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=774.92s)]
*  Well, it's nice to have a day where it's like with a heavy dose of schadenfreude. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=780.12s)]
*  Right. Like this. Yes. We all knew this was coming. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=784.64s)]
*  These people have been acting poorly in the interests of the American public. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=787.0s)]
*  And now they've revealed themselves to be the Charlton's. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=790.56s)]
*  They actually are. Yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=792.8s)]
*  And I think the other thing about it is, again, some clean heads by both men. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=794.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like that's the other thing is like, right. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=797.76s)]
*  Yes, this is exactly what I'm saying. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=798.88s)]
*  This is the thing that's been so maddening about Trump all these years. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBiutfRDN2Q&t=800.28s)]
