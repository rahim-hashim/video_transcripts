# ‘Completely beatable’: Dems go on offensive over unpopular Republican budget
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes back with you on this very, very, very special Independence Day edition of All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=0.0s)]
*  We are very glad you're here. We're glad to be here as well. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  It is a day for family and food celebrations and also in this era protests from Worcester, Massachusetts to Sioux City, South Dakota, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=10.28s)]
*  from Palm Bay, Florida to Tustin, California. Americans celebrated the nation's birthday by once again demonstrating against the Trump administration. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=20.68s)]
*  And protests scheduled all over the country as part of a Free America Weekend and No Kings 2.0, a kind of sequel to those massive protests last month [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=31.08s)]
*  against Trump's military parade in Washington that by some accounts got between three or five million people around the country at thousands of sites. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=40.04s)]
*  The protests got a new sense of urgency today with the passage of Trump's one big deficit busting bill that cuts taxes for billionaires, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=48.44s)]
*  cuts Medicaid, showers money in an utterly unprecedented fashion on the ICE police force that has been grabbing car washers and landscapers and farm workers off the street. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=55.92s)]
*  And it wasn't just Americans. Yesterday in France, ahead of the July 4th holiday, an artist unveiled a mural depicting Lady Liberty covering her face in shame, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=70.28s)]
*  of course, Lady Liberty, a gift from the French. Even before Trump signed that spending bill this afternoon, protests against his administration had reached new highs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=78.6s)]
*  According to this chart put together in June by pollster G. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  Elliott Morris, who we just spoke last hour, the number of protests against Trump this year was about triple what we saw in the same period from his first term in 2017. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=89.8s)]
*  If you watch the news or like listen to just mainstream reporting, do you get the sense that that's true? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=98.56s)]
*  I feel like you don't. I don't feel like that's actually been particularly well covered between you and me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=104.52s)]
*  That was all before this week. What we see everywhere is that Trump and Republicans are actually unpopular. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=110.0s)]
*  But here's the rub. So are Democrats. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=116.72s)]
*  And an economist YouGov poll taken last week, just 30 percent of respondents had a favorable impression of Democrats in Congress. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=120.12s)]
*  Sixty two percent had an unfavorable opinion, leaving Democrats underwater by more than 30 points. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=126.92s)]
*  Of course, that was before Democrats and the Senate and the House united in opposition to Trump's big bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=132.16s)]
*  They seem to at least as of now successfully framed it accurately, I would say, as a Republican giveaway to the plutocrats, the expense of everybody else. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=137.12s)]
*  But for many Americans protesting this Independence Day, the real question isn't what the administration doing, it's what will Democrats actually do to stop it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=145.96s)]
*  Congressman Ro Khanna is a Democrat of California, the vice chair of the Progressive Caucus, which is launching what it calls an accountability summer after the passage of the big billionaires bill. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=153.48s)]
*  And he joins me now, Congressman. Good to have you on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  Happy Fourth. Where's your head at after after this legislative victory for this genuinely awful piece of legislation? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, happy fourth, Chris, to you and your viewers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=175.64s)]
*  Look, I think you were absolutely right when you said that this bill is worse than Trump's first tax bill, than George Bush's tax bill. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=178.24s)]
*  And here's the rub of it. This bill actually makes working class folks worse off. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  It takes something from them. It's taking their health care. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=192.12s)]
*  It's taking their food security, all to give tax breaks to the billionaires. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=195.52s)]
*  The previous bills, they at least had a pretense of making everyone slightly better off. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  And what we're going to be doing this summer is going into districts like Nancy Mase's, which have over 100000 people on Medicaid and not having me say things, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=203.76s)]
*  but having people themselves tell their stories about what this is going to mean for hospitals there, for families there, for premiums going up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=213.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how much do you think is that where you see accountability happening? Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=222.04s)]
*  So, you know, there's there's there's going to be the midterms. Right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=226.56s)]
*  And there are a bunch of frontline House members, although Nancy Mase got herself a sweet deal in which she was redistricted into a very, very comfy district. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=230.16s)]
*  Not coincidentally, her politics got much more right wing when she went from a swing district to a very comfy district. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=239.84s)]
*  But it does seem like that is the frontline place. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=246.44s)]
*  And then there's obviously Senate contests that this might actually start to bite in some political fashion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=250.4s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, there are districts like David Valdez's a couple of points where which have some of the largest Medicaid recipients where I think, you know, he's in huge trouble. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=258.92s)]
*  But we need to actually go into these districts and show, not tell. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=270.04s)]
*  I mean, not just have me on your show or CNN, but actually have the folks who are going to be affected. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=274.36s)]
*  And two things that people don't understand right away, there's going to be an impact with the ending of the ACA subsidies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=279.88s)]
*  That means that premiums are going to go up for anyone on the Affordable Care Act. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=287.24s)]
*  The second thing is because hospitals are going to anticipate these Medicaid cuts, they're going to start charging more to private insurance. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=291.36s)]
*  And I mean, everyone in America's private insurance is going to go up. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  So we need folks in these districts telling these stories. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  There are about 30 districts and even Nancy Mase. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, yes, it's about 10 percent now more Republican. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=307.08s)]
*  But I think even those districts, there's going to be opportunities for us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=310.52s)]
*  Stacey Abrams is talking about this also at the Senate level. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=315.44s)]
*  And that's obviously, you know, the other contested races that Democrats are looking at. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got North Carolina where Tom Tillis, who voted against this, is not running. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=324.64s)]
*  So there won't be an incumbent senator, but that'll be an open seat. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=328.28s)]
*  You got Susan Collins, of course, who's beaten back challenges before, who also voted against it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=330.32s)]
*  But then you've got when you sort of start to expand out, you've got Texas, you've got Iowa, got even Nebraska. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got Alaska, where Lisa Murkowski did vote for this. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=343.36s)]
*  So this is what Stacey Abrams had to say about just sort of taking this messaging into those state Senate state races as well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=347.72s)]
*  We've got 100 senators, not 50. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=356.72s)]
*  And the extent to which we absolve Republican senators of protecting their people, we are doing their job for them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=359.32s)]
*  The best way to get a politician to not act is to not hold that person accountable. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  This is about an accountability summer. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=372.48s)]
*  How important do you think that is in these for these senators as well to hear from people after their vote for this bill? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=376.24s)]
*  Stacey is absolutely right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=384.48s)]
*  She did a brilliant job in Georgia and her helping out across the country will be critical. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=385.48s)]
*  Look, Texas, we've got a great shot because Cornyn is in trouble. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=390.52s)]
*  Paxton, who may win the primary, is completely beatable. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=393.92s)]
*  And Colin Allred is running again. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=397.0s)]
*  From friends of mine in Iowa, they say that Joni Ernst really has offended a lot of folks with some of the cavalier comments she's made about Medicaid cuts. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=399.48s)]
*  And also remember, tariffs have really been hurting people in places like Iowa. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=408.68s)]
*  So I think there's six, seven Senate seats you mentioned, so the others that are going to be competitive. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=414.24s)]
*  And we have a very clear message. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=419.24s)]
*  People keep saying, what's the Democratic message? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=420.8s)]
*  Her message is pretty simple. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=422.76s)]
*  You shouldn't take health care and food assistance away from the working class and make them poorer to give tax breaks to the billionaires. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=423.96s)]
*  And whether you're AOC or whether you're Jared Golden, you can agree on that platform. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  How do you understand the polling that shows the Democratic approval and Democrats of Congress being so low? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=440.28s)]
*  I have my own theory on it, which is basically any time you're that low, it means a lot of your own partisans are mad at you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=447.56s)]
*  That's the only way you get numbers that low. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=452.68s)]
*  And they might be mad at you for a bunch of different reasons. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=454.92s)]
*  But what's your read on it? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=456.6s)]
*  Why do we hate you, Congressman? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, people, Congress has been low for a long time. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=461.56s)]
*  But I'll tell you, people are frustrated in this situation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=464.16s)]
*  How in the world did we allow Donald Trump to win a second time? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=467.72s)]
*  I think that's the first frustration. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=471.4s)]
*  How did we get to this place? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=473.08s)]
*  And then second, you know, since Schumer made that budget deal, why are we not standing up? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=475.4s)]
*  I think, though, you see more and more Democrats fighting now. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=481.08s)]
*  You see more people realizing they can't just be in Congress. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=484.84s)]
*  They've got to be in the town halls. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=487.64s)]
*  And I do think people are responding to the base. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=489.64s)]
*  And, you know, Mamdani's win and I know you've talked about it, Ezra has talked about it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=493.4s)]
*  I mean, that shows that there's also a need for a new generation and people are going to organize and be creative on social media. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=497.08s)]
*  And people want to see some new blood. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=504.12s)]
*  And that's also part of it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  They see folks there have been there 50 years. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  And they're like, come on, let's get some new folks a chance. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=509.48s)]
*  One of the sort of genuinely sad and striking aspects of the Senate, of the Congress, the House math yesterday was that three seats by Democrats are unoccupied because those members sadly passed away just in the last few months. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=514.44s)]
*  Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you so much for your time. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=531.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjrVzVC7zs4&t=539.48s)]
