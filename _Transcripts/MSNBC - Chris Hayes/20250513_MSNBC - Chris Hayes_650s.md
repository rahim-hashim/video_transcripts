# Trump will leave ‘one family better off financially’ — his own: Sen. Warren on Trump’s corruption
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI)
*  The only thing that unites the policies that Trump has announced today on his Middle East tour so far [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=0.0s)]
*  is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted. Adoring audiences, investment opportunities, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=6.4s)]
*  a new flying palace. This is the place Donald Trump feels most at home because these countries [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=12.72s)]
*  get Trump in a way that they never got any other American president. This American president [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=19.44s)]
*  admires despots. He envies what they have. He wants to trade places. We know this about him [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=24.08s)]
*  when he had that love affair with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=30.32s)]
*  Hey, he's the head of a country and I mean he's the strong head. Don't let anyone think anything [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=36.16s)]
*  different. He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=42.32s)]
*  I want my people to do the same. He speaks, they stand up at attention. Yeah, they do that in Saudi [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  for sure. We know this about Trump when a Washington Post writer named Jamal Khashoggi [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=53.28s)]
*  was brutally murdered and that is dismembered by thugs on orders from the man he's toasting today, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=59.36s)]
*  the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. But you take a look, it's a rough part of the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=65.28s)]
*  It's a nasty place. It's a nasty part of the world. But if what happened happened and if the facts [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=72.08s)]
*  check out, it's something that's very bad. At the same time, they have been a very good ally of ours. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=80.72s)]
*  They've been helping us a lot with respect to Israel. They've been funding a lot of things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=87.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, they've been funding a lot of good things. They've been funding a lot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=94.0s)]
*  That's true. The gulf states that are hosting Trump understand him. They recognize he's not there [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=98.08s)]
*  as a representative of the American people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Obviously not. He's there for himself and they're there to indulge him. And it's not because Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=111.28s)]
*  is a unique force of nature. He's not special. He's just easy. I mean, he's not even the first [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  for him later to be gifted a 747 by the Qataris. They've run this play before. Turkey's president, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=124.4s)]
*  Erdogan, got a half billion dollar jumbo jet back in 2018 after Turkey broke a regional embargo on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=131.04s)]
*  Qatar over its alleged support of jihadists. I think of this, the American president and Turkey's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=137.92s)]
*  authoritarian strongman, the only two members of the Qatari Flying Palace Club. Yeah, that seems [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=146.16s)]
*  about right. And this is the thing, the gulf states have been doing this forever, right? They don't [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=153.84s)]
*  have huge armies. In the case of Qatar and the UAE, they tiny physically. What they've got is a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=158.96s)]
*  lot of oil and a lot of money and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. Now, that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=164.16s)]
*  goes a long way, but goes only so far with traditional law abiding American administrations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=170.32s)]
*  With Donald Trump, a man not just willing but thirsty to trade on the trappings of the office, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  American voters have stood on him. With a man that corrupt, well, the sky is the limit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=180.16s)]
*  Yeah. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, sits on the Senate Banking and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  Finance Committees and she joins me now. I should say, Senator, that the president is once again [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=190.24s)]
*  defending his acceptance of this gift. Acceptance almost seems too passive. It's unclear to me that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=195.28s)]
*  it wasn't actually solicited. You know, it would be crazy. Do you want the taxpayers to pay for it? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=202.24s)]
*  What exactly is wrong with this in your mind? Well, as you rightly said, you know, he says [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=207.68s)]
*  he has to accept a gift. The Trojan horse was a gift, as you rightly pointed out, and the idea [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=215.2s)]
*  that he's just going to jump on this plane and fly all around. You know, there are folks in the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=221.28s)]
*  Defense Department who are pointing out they're going to have to tear that plane apart and go [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=226.16s)]
*  over every nut, every bolt, every screw. We are now told in the Senate that it will cost more to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=231.2s)]
*  take that plane apart and make sure there aren't tracking devices and listening devices in it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  and take longer than it would to build the original plane that they were trying to build. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=243.68s)]
*  But all that really tells you is it's dumb. But the heart was still willing. What Donald Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=248.72s)]
*  wanted was something that was a big giant plane for him to fly around in, and let's face it, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=256.48s)]
*  for him to use personally and then at the end to give it to his library so he would have it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=262.08s)]
*  forever and ever. And to me, this is the perfect example of what this Trump administration has [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=266.56s)]
*  become all about. For two years, he ran for president saying on day one, I will lower costs [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=274.72s)]
*  for American families. He gets elected. His first interview, he says, I got elected because I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=280.64s)]
*  promised to lower costs on day one. About a month later, he gets asked about the tariffs and told [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=286.56s)]
*  that those are going to increase costs for American families. And his quote is that he [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=293.84s)]
*  couldn't care less. So it turns out we've now figured out maybe 115 days into this administration [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  that Donald Trump is actually going to make one family better off financially, and that's the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump family and everybody else. Donald Trump just couldn't care less. Yeah, I mean, there's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=313.52s)]
*  something remarkable about your kids got to go down to two dollars max, maybe five pencils. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=318.48s)]
*  We're just going to take the flying Qatari palace in the air. Don't you worry about it. I mean, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=324.88s)]
*  within a week of each other, he's saying those two things. Right. And you know, the thing is about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  this. It's not just that the Saudis and the Qataris get to play. UAE is in on this as well [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=337.68s)]
*  with the Bitcoin scam. So here's Donald Trump, who announces a cut three weeks ago now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=346.72s)]
*  He says he's going to do a Bitcoin deal and the stable question, say Bitcoin, a stable coin deal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=354.0s)]
*  And here's the stable coin deal. He's going to go into business with an outfit called Binance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  Now, this is an outfit that has been doing stable coins for a long time. They were forced to plead [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  criminal money laundering that is helping out drug traffickers, terrorists and others. They're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=373.44s)]
*  not permitted to do business in the United States. And their CEO actually went to jail. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=380.0s)]
*  Remind yourself just how bad it has to be before CEOs get sent to jail for white collar crimes. So [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  these guys end up in jail. Now they are business partners with Donald Trump while the guy, the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=393.44s)]
*  former CEO, is allegedly asking for a pardon. What a great way to get up there with Donald Trump, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=400.96s)]
*  offer to cut him in on the deal. But the UAE says, whoa, we can go better than that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=408.96s)]
*  Now that you have this partnership with Binance, here's what we're going to do. We're going to put [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  $2 billion into the partnership, which boosts Donald Trump's fortunes immensely. He makes money [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=422.64s)]
*  off every transaction. He makes money off the money that is deposited and they pay no interest on. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  Another way for UAE to say, we understand how this works. We have just out in full view of everyone, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  basically offer Donald Trump a giant gift from a foreign entity in violation of the constitution, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=447.6s)]
*  in violation of law and in violation of what is right in this country. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=457.36s)]
*  The sort of the blatantness of all this, I think in a weird way has kind of redounded to his benefit. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=463.76s)]
*  It's not like someone like if you discovered a secret message that the Emiratis were wiring [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=470.8s)]
*  $2 billion to a secret bank account, I think that would be an enormous scandal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Sort of doing out in the open, but I will say this, I want to show you something that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  some Republican senators do seem at the very least a little uneasy with the flying Qatari Palace. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  I want to play you some of it and get your reaction to see if there's anything there, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=491.68s)]
*  there, and they're willing to do anything about it. Take a listen. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  I think maybe the thing to do is to say, hey, we appreciate it, but there's a lot of things [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=500.32000000000005s)]
*  you could help us out with. It doesn't seem to be right, and I think it's not going to pass [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=503.68s)]
*  the smell test. Well, my only concern is the safety of the president. I mean, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=508.24s)]
*  Qatar's not, in my opinion, a great ally. Well, they better sweep that plane from front to back. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=511.68s)]
*  And to your point, Senator, I mean, and to Senator Loomis's point, you know, I just want to say that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=525.6s)]
*  like what you said before about it's going to cost a ton of money, like the thing's going to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=530.08s)]
*  have to be basically taken apart and put back together again. Yeah. Yeah. But remember, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=534.0s)]
*  these are Republicans who are just very tentatively saying might not be the greatest deal rather than [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=540.24s)]
*  say, whoa, S.T.O.P. No, we're not doing this. You're not doing this. President United States [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  does not doing this. Is there anybody on God's green earth who thinks that the Qataris are giving [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=553.84s)]
*  a four hundred million dollar airplane to Donald Trump without expecting or having already gotten [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=561.6s)]
*  something in return? And keep in mind, this is the question about corruption is the central issue on [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  this stable coins bill, which right now is being voted on in Congress. And all but one, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=575.84s)]
*  senators on the Republican side said they are all in. They don't want any curbs that would prevent [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=582.72s)]
*  the president of the United States making what appears to be somewhere between hundreds of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  millions of dollars and billions of dollars off his stable coin undertakings from again, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=595.52s)]
*  God only knows who we know two of the actors, the felon and the and the UAE, the Emirates. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=603.84s)]
*  But who else is playing in this game and what favors are they getting from Donald Trump in [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=613.28s)]
*  return for the money that they are putting into these stable coins? And yet, so far, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=619.68s)]
*  every Republican senator save one has said it's OK with them. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60yw1Xi1JI&t=625.76s)]
