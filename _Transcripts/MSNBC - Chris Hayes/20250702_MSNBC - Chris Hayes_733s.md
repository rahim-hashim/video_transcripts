# ‘Ruinous’: Trump bill ‘screws over his own voters,’ says Hayes
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hazel. Right now, all eyes are on Congress. House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans are pushing for final passage of Donald Trump's signature big ugly bill, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  frankly. We don't know if it will pass. We do know it is deeply unpopular and it is laying [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=11.6s)]
*  bare one of the biggest, starkest contradictions in MAGA and Republican politics. Sort of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=17.84s)]
*  defining tension at the heart of this whole era, a contradiction that's been there since the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  beginning. You might not remember this, but back in Donald Trump's first months as president, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=26.8s)]
*  remember the first thing they did was to push an Obamacare repeal bill that slashed Medicaid, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=31.36s)]
*  included tax cuts for investors, and it didn't exactly jive with his campaign schtick of standing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=36.8s)]
*  up for the little guy. A Bloomberg analysis showed that counties that voted for you, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  middle-class and working-class counties, would do far less well under this bill than the counties [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=47.84s)]
*  in the more affluent counties. It seems like maybe this isn't consistent with the message of the last [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=54.32s)]
*  election. No, a lot of things aren't consistent, but these are going to be negotiated. We will [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=59.36s)]
*  take care of our people or I'm not signing it. He's going to take care of his people. You can [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=64.96s)]
*  take that to the bank. Well, he never got a chance to sign it because famously it died in the Senate, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=70.96s)]
*  but he was pushing hard for it, just like he pushed successfully for this tax cuts for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=74.64s)]
*  billionaires and corporations that he did sign into the law last time he was president. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=78.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, I don't think I have to tell you, doesn't seem to really care about his people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=83.12s)]
*  Instead, he took care of the ultra-rich at the expense of his voters, and that dynamic, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  whew, boy is it alive tonight. Because this Trump reconciliation bill is loaded with perks for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=93.12s)]
*  billionaires and businesses, all kinds of backdoor sweetheart corporate pork deals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  It rolls back U.S. energy policies in the most insane way you can imagine by decades. It funds [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=105.36s)]
*  a police state led by ICE. It slashes healthcare and food subsidies for mostly poor and older [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=111.44s)]
*  Americans, boots millions off their health insurance, while still, to be clear, adding an [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  estimated $3 trillion to the deficit, which may be kind of a problem in the bond markets anytime soon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=122.24s)]
*  Right now, that bill, which the Senate passed yesterday by one tie-breaking vote from J.D. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=128.48s)]
*  Vance, is up in the air in the House. Republicans can only afford to lose three votes, and there [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=132.24s)]
*  are holdouts. Trump met with several groups of them today in the White House, including [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=137.36s)]
*  conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus, who say they're worried about the bill spending and the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=142.0s)]
*  fact it adds $3 trillion to the deficit, and I think so-called or self-identified moderates [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=146.8s)]
*  who are worried that their voters in swing districts will punish them for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=152.24s)]
*  a crappy bill that cuts so many vital programs and services. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=156.4s)]
*  But one of the weird things here is that Trump's most reliable votes, the ones that he already has [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=161.68s)]
*  tallied up that he can count on for the bill, will come from the hardcore MAGA heads in Congress, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=165.52s)]
*  many of whom represent places that are going to get absolutely hammered the most by the bill's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=171.52s)]
*  provisions. Alarms are already being sounded in states like Oklahoma and West Virginia and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=176.8s)]
*  Kentucky, where cuts to Medicaid funding in the bill could crush rural hospitals and the patients [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  who rely on them. The bill is going to be especially ruinous to the rural white Trump base, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=187.84s)]
*  but their elected Republican lawmakers don't seem to mind or care or know, I don't know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=194.08s)]
*  they're just voting in lockstep with Trump to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Even if, as noticed reported today, Trump still doesn't seem to have a firm grasp [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  about what his signature legislative achievement does. Get this, listen to this one. According to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=210.0s)]
*  three sources with direct knowledge of the comments, the president told Republicans at this meeting he [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  had with the holdouts that there are three things Congress shouldn't touch if they want to win [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=220.16s)]
*  elections, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. And as we just pointed out, this bill cuts Medicaid [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  massively. Even some of MAGA's highest profile Republicans like JD Vance and Josh Hawley have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=231.84s)]
*  made so much noise about being the party of the working class and the working man. They've of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=237.92s)]
*  course chosen to back this bill. You don't understand this. There are a lot of people in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=243.76s)]
*  the Republican base. The great nonprofit newsroom, More Perfect Union, found out back in March when [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=248.24s)]
*  they actually went about and they visited a bunch of Trump voters in a Trump district in California [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  Central Valley. And it happens to be the district with the highest percentage of residents on Medicaid [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=258.24s)]
*  in the entire country. My medication, it runs $20,000 a month without insurance. I make $800 a month. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that will kill me. That would kill my friends. That would kill millions of people in this country [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=272.56s)]
*  if they lose their health care. If you didn't have Medicaid, how much would this cost you? How much money? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=278.72s)]
*  Thousands maybe. Thousands? And that's just for you? That's for me. Not for your daughter? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=285.36s)]
*  Not for your sister? No. The medicine that my daughter takes for her for seizures, I won't be able to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=292.48s)]
*  afford it. So we feel hopeless if those cuts come. What are we going to do? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=298.88s)]
*  Those are the stakes here, right? Like real people, millions of them around the country, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  who depend on this health insurance from the government. And so far, Republicans are coping [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=312.08s)]
*  with this fundamental, obvious contradiction by just lying their constituents and just falling in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=316.64s)]
*  line. Let me give you an example of how this kind of thing works. So Derek Van Orton is a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  Wisconsin Republican. And he's an interesting case because he represents a true swing district [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=327.76s)]
*  that's also rural in character. Okay? And back in March, boy, boy, he got all wound up and he [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=332.24s)]
*  sounded like he was sticking to his guns on this bill. I have very, very few hard lines when it comes [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=339.28s)]
*  to these issues that we talk about regularly. One of them is this, that I've been crystal clear [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=347.2s)]
*  with the leadership in the House here. If during this budget reconciliation process, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=355.68s)]
*  they're going to try to cut rural healthcare, I am not on board. I will not be on board with a package [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=360.56s)]
*  that does, that if anybody is trying to cut any type of rural healthcare, it's just not going to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=367.52s)]
*  happen on my watch. So that was his red line back in March. Then two months later, he voted to pass [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=374.08s)]
*  a House version of the Trump bill that did exactly what he said he would vote against. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=380.4s)]
*  Republicans like Van Orton at some levels, you can see they understand cuts to healthcare [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=385.52s)]
*  would be devastating their communities. Crossing Trump would be devastating to their future political [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=389.44s)]
*  prospects. Not to mention it probably involves like having to deal with a lot more security, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  frankly. It's why Republicans have been lying so consistently to their own constituents about just [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=399.44s)]
*  what the bill does. We are not cutting Medicaid. The president has said that and I've said that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=407.04s)]
*  We've all said that. By the way, nobody would get kicked off Medicaid. The bottom line is that we're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=413.12s)]
*  just, we're not taking away anybody's Medicaid. There's no cuts to Medicaid. This bill strengthens [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  Medicaid. It will protect those benefits that hardworking Americans need. Okay, that's just [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=423.04s)]
*  plainly a lie. They are of course cutting Medicaid. I mean, think about it for a second. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=431.36s)]
*  Where else are they going to get the savings in the bill from, right? Like their own numbers, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=435.36s)]
*  they're cutting it to the tune of nearly one trillion dollars. If you're wondering what a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=440.56s)]
*  cut that large would mean, for starters, it would kick nearly 12 million people off of their health [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=447.04s)]
*  insurance over the next decade. In addition to reducing hospital revenues by hundreds of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=452.08s)]
*  billions of dollars. All the guaranteeing that many in underserved communities will shut their doors. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=457.6s)]
*  There are frontline Republicans who are feeling intense political pressure on this vote. They are [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=464.56s)]
*  in districts that aren't as pro-Trump and look like they will be very hotly contested next year. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=468.08s)]
*  Now they also are largely voting for this bill that again, no one really likes, even its defenders [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=472.88s)]
*  who I was watching today on TV, like couldn't say anything good about it. They're the ones who are [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=478.4s)]
*  really putting their political lives on the altar. They're the ones who met with Trump today, along [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=483.92s)]
*  with others. For them, the calculation is, can they get a big enough benefit from a pro-Trump vote to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=488.4s)]
*  offset the risk of alienating constituents back home? Anything that makes them comfortable voting [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=493.44s)]
*  to cut taxes on rich people and corporations while depriving millions of healthcare and food stamps. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=498.4s)]
*  Claire McCaskill is a former Democratic Senator of Missouri. John Lovett was a speechwriter for [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=504.48s)]
*  President Barack Obama. He's co-host of Pod Save America, host of the Love It or Leave It podcast, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=508.24s)]
*  and they join me now. Claire, I want to start with you as someone who's actually been in these rooms, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=513.76s)]
*  at least on the Senate side, not on the House side, but in big legislative fights and particularly [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=518.0s)]
*  when you were representing Missouri over your time there, particularly as it sort of trended [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=522.24s)]
*  in a more conservative direction, just making calculations about legislation, what you were [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=526.72s)]
*  able to tell people back home, and how you think these different constituencies in the Republican [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=532.72s)]
*  House are thinking through this right now. Yeah, it's interesting because what we were trying to, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  the only similarity I really see is really on the Affordable Care Act, where there was intense [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=546.32s)]
*  political pressure. There was a whole lot of misinformation out there about what we were [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  trying to do. But what we were doing in its essence, Chris, is we were trying to get more [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  people to have healthcare, not less. Yes, exactly. I mean, it was controversial because it was change, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=560.88s)]
*  and change is hard in a system like healthcare. But we weren't trying to claw healthcare away [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=567.76s)]
*  from people. What's really interesting about this is the Republican MAGA party has dressed up as if [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=573.2s)]
*  they were for the little guy, and the beating heart of this legislation is all about rich people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=580.4s)]
*  And they all know it. And the reason they're working so hard, even Trump said you should [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=586.88s)]
*  raise taxes on the rich, but oh no, the Republican party is in charge now. They are so hyper-focused [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=592.24s)]
*  on giving tax credit, tax cuts, to the wealthiest Americans that they are forgetting about the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=598.88s)]
*  people who have put them in office. It is really political malpractice, and I don't think it's going [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=605.84s)]
*  to end well for them. I really don't, especially if the bill passes. That point you made in the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=610.72s)]
*  ACA, and we'll see. I mean, I think everyone sort of at some level, if you had to bet, would expect [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=616.64s)]
*  the bill to pass, but also crazy things happened. I all remember the John McCain thumbs down back [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=621.12s)]
*  in 2017. But John, Claire mentioned ACA. I covered that and saw it up close. And one of the things [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wUYvUw5lg0&t=627.2800000000001s)]
