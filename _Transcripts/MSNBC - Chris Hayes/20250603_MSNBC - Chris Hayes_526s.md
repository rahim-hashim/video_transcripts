# Musk turns on GOP, suggests ‘we fire all politicians' who voted for MAGA bill
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o)
*  ANTONIA HILTON, CNN NEWSHOUR ANCHOR, ANCHORING, AND ANALYSTICS. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=1.0s)]
*  I'm Antonia Hilton. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=2.0s)]
*  I'm in for Chris Hayes tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=3.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, the unelected billionaire who left the White House just last week, is now whipping [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=4.48s)]
*  votes against Donald Trump's big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at the tweet, which I'm told we do have ready here, from Elon Musk, who says, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=12.52s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=18.6s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=20.88s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=25.84s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=27.96s)]
*  You know it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=29.56s)]
*  In a follow-up post, Musk added this, quote, in November next year, we fire all politicians [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=31.2s)]
*  who betrayed the American people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=37.32s)]
*  Now contrast that with the much more diplomatic tone Musk had just a few days ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=39.6s)]
*  I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like, well, I don't want to speak up against the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=46.44s)]
*  administration, but I don't want to also don't want to take responsibility for everything [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=52.36s)]
*  the administration's doing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=58.64s)]
*  But then on Sunday, something changed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=60.72s)]
*  Trump pulled the nomination of Musk's close collaborator and, to be NASA administrator, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  a billionaire named Jared Isaacman. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=69.16s)]
*  And so now the bill is a, quote, disgusting abomination. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=71.8s)]
*  But Speaker of the House Mike Johnson disagrees with Musk. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=75.44s)]
*  It's very disappointing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=79.8s)]
*  OK, I've come to consider Elon a good friend. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=80.8s)]
*  But with all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big beautiful bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=84.0s)]
*  We had a long conversation yesterday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=90.0s)]
*  He and I spoke for I think more than 20 minutes on the telephone. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=91.0s)]
*  And I extol a hulking hurt yous of the bill. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=95.0s)]
*  He seemed to understand that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=97.0s)]
*  We had a very friendly conversation about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=99.0s)]
*  But for him to come out and hand the whole bill is to me just very disappointing, very surprising [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=101.0s)]
*  in light of the conversation I have with him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=106.0s)]
*  Look, right now, proponents of the bill are not exactly doing themselves any favors. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=108.0s)]
*  When it comes to selling this whole thing to a skeptical public. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=113.2s)]
*  Over the weekend, Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa posted a video addressing criticism of her claim [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=116.2s)]
*  that the bill's proposed Medicaid cuts don't matter because, quote, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=122.2s)]
*  well, we're all going to die. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=126.2s)]
*  I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=130.2s)]
*  yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  So I apologize. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's a real video that she posted. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Today, Senator Ernst seemed much more diplomatic, though, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  as she raced to the Senate elevators to avoid questions from reporters. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  Do you care to clarify your comments from the town hall last week, Senator? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=164.6s)]
*  Just to set the record straight. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=169.6s)]
*  I'm very compassionate and you need to listen to the entire conversation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=171.6s)]
*  Do you have any objections about that? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=175.6s)]
*  Can you explain your... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=176.6s)]
*  ...how you want to protect the most vulnerable? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=177.6s)]
*  Senator Ernst's colleague, Republican Roger Marshall of Kansas, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=179.6s)]
*  also tried to spin the bill as protecting the vulnerable today, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=182.6s)]
*  telling Americans with a straight face that Republicans want to strengthen Medicaid [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=186.6s)]
*  by adding a whole lot of work requirements and by cutting Medicaid. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  As you mentioned, we've got folks that are afraid of the small Medicaid cuts that we made already, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Medicaid cuts that are going to strengthen Medicaid and save it for those who need it the most. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  So we're pretty far apart yet. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen is a Democrat from Maryland. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  He serves on the Appropriations Committee and he joins us now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for your time tonight, Senator. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  So, Elon Musk is now saying... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Good to be with you, Anton. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk is now saying what he really thinks, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=220.0s)]
*  calling this bill a pork-filled abomination. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=222.0s)]
*  Will his attempts to torch the mega bill now have an impact on the Senate? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=225.0s)]
*  And what does this break signal to you? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=230.0s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope it will and I talked to some of my Republican colleagues [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=234.0s)]
*  who I think were surprised by the comments, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=239.0s)]
*  but I don't agree with Elon Musk much these days, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=242.0s)]
*  but he had it absolutely right in this case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=246.0s)]
*  This bill is an abomination. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=249.2s)]
*  It's a beautiful bill only if you're a billionaire. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=251.2s)]
*  For everybody else, this is a big betrayal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=254.2s)]
*  because candidate Trump said he was going to be looking out for the forgotten Americans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=256.2s)]
*  All he's looking out for here are billionaires at everybody else's expenses. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=261.2s)]
*  And when you played Senator Ernst's video, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=266.2s)]
*  her original response and then her effort to make light of it, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=270.2s)]
*  it exposes the whole thing because more people will die early [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=274.4s)]
*  if this bill goes through with these Medicaid cuts [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=279.4s)]
*  and they can try and dress it up however they want, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=283.4s)]
*  but at the end of the day, Elon Musk is right that this is an abomination. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=286.4s)]
*  It will add trillions of dollars to our deficit and debt [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=291.4s)]
*  even after they make these cuts to Medicaid and food nutrition programs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=294.4s)]
*  So it should be defeated. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=299.4s)]
*  Senator, I have to ask you about your thoughts on Senator Ernst's remarks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, is it your sense that she's performing for an audience of one, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  for President Trump? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Is this who she is, your colleague? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, it really is hard to make sense of that response, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  both the original response but then the effort to make light of it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  because there's nothing to make light of when it comes to the impact [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=327.8s)]
*  of these Medicaid cuts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=331.8s)]
*  They will result in millions of Americans losing access to healthcare, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=333.8s)]
*  millions of Americans who will no longer be able to afford their healthcare, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=339.8s)]
*  and the reality is more Americans will die as a result of it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=343.8s)]
*  So to first make light of that serious concern [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=347.8s)]
*  that was expressed by a constituent at that meeting, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=350.8s)]
*  that was bad enough, but then to try to make it all into one big joke [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=355.0s)]
*  I think just underscores the challenges Republicans are going to have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=362.0s)]
*  when it comes to explaining what they're doing to the American people. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=366.0s)]
*  Again, the bottom line is millions of Americans are going to suffer [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=370.0s)]
*  in order to provide these huge tax cuts to billionaires. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=375.0s)]
*  That's what this bill is all about. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=379.0s)]
*  It is an abomination. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=381.0s)]
*  Republicans keep reframing this though as actually a form of saving [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=383.2s)]
*  and preserving Medicaid. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=388.2s)]
*  And so, you know, part of their argument of course is we're just going to get [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=391.2s)]
*  the guys who are playing video games in their basements off of this program [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=395.2s)]
*  that's going to make it so disabled people, your grandmother, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=399.2s)]
*  they're able to have better access to this program. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=403.2s)]
*  In fact, even some Republicans have straight up said [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=406.2s)]
*  we're not really cutting Medicaid at all here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=409.2s)]
*  Dr. Oz said just the other day to Politico's Dasha Burns, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=411.4s)]
*  quote, we are not cutting Medicaid. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=415.4s)]
*  He said there is no proposal I've seen in fact in fairness [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=417.4s)]
*  that doesn't increase spending on Medicaid. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=420.4s)]
*  So what's your response to that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=422.4s)]
*  Is that in line with reality and the text that you've seen? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=424.4s)]
*  This is a big lie. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=430.4s)]
*  I mean, pure and simple, this is an effort to fool the American people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=432.4s)]
*  and the American people. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  And so all you have to do is look at the nonpartisan referees [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  who call balls and strikes in these issues and the umpires, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  the Congressional Budget Office. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  They've made it clear that this will have a very harmful impact [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  on the Medicaid program. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  And that means for people who are in nursing homes, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  that means for people with disabilities, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  that means people who are just trying to scrape by [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  and afford health care, they will all suffer terribly. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=466.8s)]
*  They'll either lose access entirely, as I said, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=470.8s)]
*  or they won't be able to afford health care. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=472.8s)]
*  And this is at the same time that in this bill, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=476.8s)]
*  Republicans are cutting food and nutrition programs, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=478.8s)]
*  energy assistance programs. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=481.8s)]
*  So this is going to be coming at working people [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=483.8s)]
*  from all angles and hitting them very hard. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=487.8s)]
*  And again, for what purpose? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=490.8s)]
*  To provide huge tax cuts to billionaires. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=494.0s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=498.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ddru5vh8o&t=523.8s)]
