Video Description: “What they say is it doesn't feel like the people making these cuts actually had any idea who we are, what we did, or maybe not even where we worked,” says Jacob Soboroff on the federal workers in West Virginia who are facing termination—despite their vital work keeping coal miners safe.

# ‘Insane’: Workers who protect coal miners face termination thanks to DOGE
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4)
*  Is that an incredible job? $150 billion. Think of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=0.0s)]
*  $160 billion. Yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah, $160 billion. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=7.0s)]
*  You're just counting. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=8.0s)]
*  Ha ha, who's counting? That was Donald Trump and Elon Musk celebrating the $160 billion [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=9.0s)]
*  in unilateral doge cuts not authorized by Congress. Although the conservative think [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=15.0s)]
*  tank, the Manhattan Institute, is counting, it has the number much lower. About $5 billion [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=20.0s)]
*  in unverified cuts, less than one-tenth of 1% of federal spending. So they're not making [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=26.0s)]
*  a gigantic dent on spending. In fact, federal outlays have gone up. They are making a gigantic [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=31.0s)]
*  dent in the people and services Americans rely on. Real people who become the unnecessary [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=36.0s)]
*  victims of Elon Musk and his chainsaw. Among them are federal workers focused on screening [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=41.0s)]
*  coal miners for black lung disease. Yes, you heard me right. More than 200 workers for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=48.0s)]
*  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health working in West Virginia were laid [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=53.0s)]
*  off at the beginning of the month. NBC News national correspondent Jacob Soboroff has [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=59.0s)]
*  new reporting on this story and the chaos it has created at NIOSH. Jacob Soboroff, who [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=64.0s)]
*  will be hosting 100 Days of Trump Live town hall tomorrow night at 9 p.m. Eastern, joins [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=69.0s)]
*  me now. Jacob, first of all, tell me about what these federal workers, what their jobs [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=74.0s)]
*  were before they were laid off. To literally study the disease black lung in coal miners, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=79.0s)]
*  which is deadlier than ever, is extremely prevalent throughout Appalachia, and is basically [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=85.0s)]
*  the worst nightmare of anybody going down into the coal mines in that part of the country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=92.0s)]
*  And for decades, by statute, they were doing exactly that. But at the beginning of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=97.0s)]
*  month, they received a reduction in force notice, a riff, when HHS cut all those federal [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=102.0s)]
*  employees, and they were literally locked out of the building. That van that you saw [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=107.0s)]
*  in the picture was locked up behind a chain link fence, and the program was effectively [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=111.0s)]
*  ended, Chris. Now, you made an important point there. This is the product of legislation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=116.0s)]
*  Like, black lung disease is not something that members of Congress of Appalachia have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=124.0s)]
*  ignored. And through the years, they've worked very hard and passed a lot of legislation [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=131.0s)]
*  to deal with it in terms of compensation, federal health care, research, screening. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=136.0s)]
*  So this cut is to a program that Congress has passed a law to make it happen, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=141.0s)]
*  Not only that, this program was terminated the week before the President of the United [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=148.0s)]
*  States signed an executive order to expand coal mining in West Virginia. And when you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=153.0s)]
*  talk to any miners down there, talk to the researchers, talk to the workers at NIOSH, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=158.0s)]
*  talk to the miners, the miners will tell you this program was absolutely necessary because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=163.0s)]
*  in order to get health care in Appalachia, particularly the rural parts, it's extremely [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=168.0s)]
*  hard to travel to some of these places. So this van that would show up and come to literally [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=173.0s)]
*  the doorstep of the mines allowed hundreds of thousands of people to get chest x-rays, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=177.0s)]
*  which are currently locked up in the basement of the building they're not able to access. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=183.0s)]
*  In order to do the research to provide the health care that these people need, I want to show you, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=187.0s)]
*  Chris, a little bit of what some of the coal miners said to me when I visited them in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=190.0s)]
*  Morgantown, West Virginia. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=193.0s)]
*  As someone who's still working underground, are you worried about what that means for your health? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=197.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Without having the protection or the sampling and some of the stuff that NIOSH does, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=201.0s)]
*  we're not going to be nearly as protected as we are now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=208.0s)]
*  They just started closing things up and not even looking what they're doing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=212.0s)]
*  And this needs to be reinstated as quick as possible. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=217.0s)]
*  Otherwise, the mines might survive but not the miners. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=222.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=225.0s)]
*  It needs to be reinstated as quick as possible. Chris, that's exactly what the Trump administration [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=226.0s)]
*  literally yesterday said that they were doing after they discovered, oops, that they had terminated this policy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=232.0s)]
*  But we discovered, we learned today, in a NIOSH-wide memo from the director of the agency, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=238.0s)]
*  that those reinstatements allowing these workers back into the building are only going to be temporary [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=244.0s)]
*  until they can fire them again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=249.0s)]
*  And they say in this memo, move the functions of this organization over to the CDC. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=251.0s)]
*  But nobody seems to believe that NIOSH, that work in the coal miner health surveillance program in West Virginia, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=256.0s)]
*  that's actually going to be the case. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=261.0s)]
*  All right. I want to make sure I'm tracking this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=263.0s)]
*  So you've got this entity that mobile units go around for screenings, black lung disease and treatment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=265.0s)]
*  Okay? It's created by statute. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=273.0s)]
*  HHS unilaterally shuts down the unit. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=277.0s)]
*  Do they ever give justification or explanation for why they did? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=281.0s)]
*  No. And, you know, I went to a rally outside of that NIOSH building in West Virginia, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=285.0s)]
*  and I talked to so many of the workers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=289.0s)]
*  It wasn't just this program. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=291.0s)]
*  There was a program that studied firefighter fatalities all around the United States. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=293.0s)]
*  They literally would dispatch a team from NIOSH to look at the health and the safety circumstances [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=297.0s)]
*  of each firefighter death, provide recommendations, and move on to the next thing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=303.0s)]
*  They studied the masks that all of us wore during COVID to provide recommendations, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=307.0s)]
*  to make sure that these masks were efficient, and efficient is the key word here with DOGE, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=313.0s)]
*  and to make sure that they were actually protecting our lives. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=318.0s)]
*  Everybody, and this goes for all of DOGE. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=321.0s)]
*  We'll talk about this in the special tomorrow. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=323.0s)]
*  Scott Laney, the lead epidemiologist for this program, is going to join us in the studio tomorrow night. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=325.0s)]
*  Indiscriminate is the word that continues to come up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=329.0s)]
*  When you talk to the workers at the rallies, when you talk to the workers in West Virginia, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=332.0s)]
*  I went down to the CDC, I talked to workers in Atlanta, over and over again, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=335.0s)]
*  what they say is it doesn't feel like the people making these cuts actually had any idea who we are, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=339.0s)]
*  what we did, or maybe not even where we worked. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=345.0s)]
*  And it's evident in the fact that, as I said, the week after they cut this program, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=348.0s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order saying he wanted to expand coal mining in West Virginia. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=353.0s)]
*  As you heard there, they concurred that he cares about the coal mines, maybe not necessarily the coal miners. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=358.0s)]
*  Right, so they cut this like they've cut so many things, indiscriminately, then the whistle gets blown. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=364.0s)]
*  It's like, wait a second, why are you doing this? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=368.0s)]
*  And then we've seen this a ton, you know, nuclear safety technicians, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=370.0s)]
*  the longest-running women's health study that was being run out of the CDC, right, or National Institutes of Health. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=374.0s)]
*  So then they reinstate everyone, but only until June, and then after that, all these people are out of jobs, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=382.0s)]
*  so they haven't really been reinstated. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=389.0s)]
*  And I have all this right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=391.0s)]
*  Scott Laney, the chief epidemiologist of this program, has a termination date at the end of June. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=392.0s)]
*  We talked to him today, and Scott Laney said, yeah, they told me today, go back into the building, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=398.0s)]
*  I'm allowed to go back into work. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=403.0s)]
*  That's Scott right there standing outside the mobile health surveillance unit van, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=405.0s)]
*  not able to get to it, behind a U.S. government, no trespassing sign. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=408.0s)]
*  But on the 25th of June, he will again be fired, even though, as of yesterday, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=413.0s)]
*  he's being led in temporarily into the building in order to, I don't know, collect his paperwork. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=419.0s)]
*  When I was there, I could look through the window and I could see the studies that he had on his whiteboard. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=423.0s)]
*  There were no less than 12 ongoing current research projects that he was engaged in [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=427.0s)]
*  that he basically left on his desk. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=432.0s)]
*  These are health research projects, not like you can come back to them a couple of months later [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=433.0s)]
*  and the data is still going to be relevant and the data is still going to exist. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=438.0s)]
*  These are things that are ongoing and tracked in real time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=441.0s)]
*  And effectively, he's coming back in the building, but he's going to be out the building again at the end of June. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=443.0s)]
*  Just an insane story. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=448.0s)]
*  Jacob Silveroff, that's great reporting. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=450.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=452.0s)]
*  And tomorrow, Jacob and Stephanie Ruhl will take part in that live town hall [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=453.0s)]
*  with federal workers who were forced out of their jobs by the Trump administration. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=456.0s)]
*  Also be joined by Senator Cory Booker on what Congress can do to push back. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=459.0s)]
*  You can watch 100 Days of Trump Forced Out Federal Workers tomorrow, 9 p.m. Eastern on MSNBC. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=463.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d4zIsrbcr4&t=489.0s)]
