# Scandal-plagued Trump nominee for top D.C. prosecutor faces bipartisan pushback
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0)
*  Have you heard the name Ed Martin? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=0.0s)]
*  I know there's a lot of people to keep track of [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=2.24s)]
*  in Donald Trump's new administration, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=4.24s)]
*  but this guy is, I would say, a standout. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=5.74s)]
*  And I don't mean that in a good way. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=9.0s)]
*  He is the guy that Trump appointed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=11.14s)]
*  to be the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  So he's not yet Senate confirmed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=16.4s)]
*  He's an acting right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=18.64s)]
*  He is, to my mind, completely unqualified [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=21.1s)]
*  and truly a bit unhinged. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  One of the things he is doing a lot of, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=26.6s)]
*  since he got into that powerful office, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=28.72s)]
*  basically day one, as the acting U.S. Attorney, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=30.12s)]
*  not confirmed yet, he's trying to be confirmed, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=32.42s)]
*  is this habit of firing off these menacing letters [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=34.92s)]
*  all over the place. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=38.36s)]
*  For instance, to medical journals, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=39.66s)]
*  from the New England Journal of Medicine [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=42.32s)]
*  to the Journal of Stratics and Gynecology, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=44.66s)]
*  to CHEST, that's a scientific journal for CHEST doctors. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  If I'm being honest, it's the first time [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=51.36s)]
*  I've ever heard of it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=52.8s)]
*  In these letters, Martin accuses the journals, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=54.46s)]
*  this is the U.S. Attorney, acting U.S. Attorney, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=56.66s)]
*  accusing the journals of bias [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  and demands that they report back to him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  This is the kind of thing Ed Martin does. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=64.16s)]
*  It's sort of his thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=66.02s)]
*  You might recall that he sent a letter, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=67.62s)]
*  apparently only on social media, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=69.02s)]
*  threatening to chase federal employees [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=70.42s)]
*  to the end of the earth to hold them accountable [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=72.3s)]
*  for anyone pushing back on Elon Musk's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=74.72s)]
*  government efficiency folks who are flooding [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  into agencies with barely any notice. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  This is someone, it would seem to me, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=82.62s)]
*  based on these letters, who is under the impression [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=84.72s)]
*  that he lives in an authoritarian state, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=87.52s)]
*  not a free country, where people with the policing power [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=90.32s)]
*  that he's been vested with get to just impose their will [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=93.18s)]
*  at any institution whatsoever, from the CHEST Journal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=96.22s)]
*  to Georgetown Law School to Wikipedia. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=100.28s)]
*  Now, the Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to vote [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=104.12s)]
*  to start Martin's confirmation hearing, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=106.36s)]
*  but Republican Chair Chuck Grassley said today [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=108.68s)]
*  it is not on the agenda because Republicans [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=110.98s)]
*  still have questions, as they should. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=113.18s)]
*  And there is really just a really long list [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  of reasons not to nominate this guy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=119.28s)]
*  At one point, for instance, he was representing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  both sides of some of the January 6 cases. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  He was still attorney of record for the defendants. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  That's what he was doing a lot of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=129.38s)]
*  before he became acting US attorney. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=130.84s)]
*  While he was also serving as a prosecutor in the office [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  seeking to dismiss the charges. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=137.02s)]
*  And I think it's a pretty obvious violation of legal ethics [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=139.22s)]
*  to be on both sides of the same case. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=142.52s)]
*  Reuters reported that in an email to staff, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  Martin said he had stopped working on the cases [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=147.86s)]
*  and was, quote, under the impression [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=150.08s)]
*  that I was off the cases. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=151.66000000000003s)]
*  But he still advocates the January 6 rioters [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=153.38s)]
*  likening their cases to Japanese internment under FDR. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  He's also tried to get his office to essentially [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  gin up baseless criminal investigations. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=164.36s)]
*  It's a real serious no-no, against, for instance, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=167.58s)]
*  climate nonprofits. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=170.12s)]
*  In fact, they were so baseless [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=171.42s)]
*  that the senior career prosecutor who was instructed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  to start this investigation resigned [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=175.61999999999998s)]
*  rather than carry out the demand. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  And so then Ed Martin decided to try [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=179.92s)]
*  and submit a warrant on his own. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=182.27999999999997s)]
*  He was trying to freeze the money these organizations had. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=184.16s)]
*  That warrant that he submitted by himself [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  was rejected by a US magistrate judge, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=190.22s)]
*  something that very rarely happens, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  who found the request failed to establish [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=194.92s)]
*  a reasonable belief that a crime occurred. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=197.16s)]
*  Ed Martin has also appeared on Russian television [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=200.32s)]
*  more than 150 times, which does seem like a lot, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  and now has been caught in another set of, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=208.06s)]
*  let's say, statements that test the boundaries of truth. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=211.48s)]
*  Here he is last July interviewing a man named Tim Hale, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=216.68s)]
*  who he describes as a January 6 prisoner. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=220.68s)]
*  Now, Hale might look unremarkable there in that interview, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=222.88s)]
*  but here's what he looked like while on duty [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=226.42s)]
*  as a naval contractor in April of 2020, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=229.08s)]
*  proudly wearing a Hitler mustache. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=231.72s)]
*  And that was not the only time [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=234.12s)]
*  the Department of Justice recovered [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=235.78s)]
*  these other pictures from his phone, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=237.22000000000003s)]
*  posing with his Hitler mustache, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  along with several pro-Hitler images. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=241.78s)]
*  Court filings noted that coworkers remembered Hale [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  ranting about Jewish people and saying, and we quote here, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  Hitler should have finished the job. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  In written answers, the Senate Judiciary Committee, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  Martin claimed, well, he just hadn't seen the pictures [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=258.24s)]
*  of Hale with the Hitler mustache. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=260.7s)]
*  I'll say, I think it's a little tough to believe [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=262.5s)]
*  since even a very basic Google search [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=264.7s)]
*  will turn up headlines that clearly lay out [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=266.74s)]
*  Hale's avowedly Nazi sympathies. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=269.18s)]
*  I'm guessing, I guess Martin didn't bother to look that up [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=272.88s)]
*  before calling Hale, quote, an extraordinary man, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=275.18s)]
*  an extraordinary leader, at an award ceremony [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=278.54s)]
*  at Trump's Bedminster Club last August. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=282.04s)]
*  Ed Martin is currently running one of the most powerful [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=286.14s)]
*  U.S. Attorney's offices in the country, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=288.78s)]
*  but he can't stay there indefinitely. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=290.88s)]
*  He needs Senate confirmation to continue on the job. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=293.38s)]
*  And now there is a big effort to stop him [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=295.88s)]
*  from being confirmed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=298.68s)]
*  We have some major news on that next. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=299.78s)]
*  The nomination of Ed Martin to the powerful position [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=304.28s)]
*  of U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=306.38s)]
*  is sparking lots of concern on Capitol Hill. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=308.24s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is calling for an FBI investigation [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=311.44s)]
*  of Martin for failing to disclose that he made [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=315.28s)]
*  over 150 appearances on Russian state TV and radio, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  asking the FBI director to investigate [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=322.64s)]
*  whether Mr. Martin's omissions were inadvertent [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  or part of a deliberate attempt to conceal [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=326.84s)]
*  his extensive ties to Russian media [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=328.44s)]
*  and intelligence operations, writing, quote, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  the Congress of the United States and the American people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=332.44s)]
*  deserve a full picture of Mr. Martin, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=334.44s)]
*  his relationships to Russia, and his political loyalties. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=336.38s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  Democrat of Maryland, is ranking member [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  of the Judiciary Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=342.4s)]
*  I suspect, Congressman, that the appearances [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  on Russian state television are not the only reason [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  that you think Mr. Martin wouldn't be an ideal candidate [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=352.26s)]
*  for this job. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=355.46s)]
*  You're correct. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=358.0s)]
*  He's been describing a neo-Nazi Holocaust revisionist [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=358.84s)]
*  who dresses up like Adolf Hitler [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=364.5s)]
*  and gives himself a Hitler mustache as a great man, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=366.64s)]
*  a great leader, a great friend of his, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  and he defended him even when it was brought to attention [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=377.14s)]
*  that this was a guy who said that Hitler [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=380.84s)]
*  should have finished the job and that babies born [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=383.08s)]
*  with disabilities should be shot in the head. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=386.9s)]
*  All of those things were brought directly to Ed Martin, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=389.74s)]
*  Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. attorney [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=393.74s)]
*  for the District of Columbia, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  and instead of answering those questions [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=397.5s)]
*  or rebuking his friend, Hale Cousinelli, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=399.94s)]
*  for having said these things, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=403.7s)]
*  he instead attacked the national public radio, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=405.6s)]
*  calling it government-paid propaganda. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=408.44s)]
*  This person is absolutely unfit to be a United States attorney [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=412.6s)]
*  in the Department of Justice, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=417.14s)]
*  without even getting into the point [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=419.08s)]
*  that he suppressed the fact that he'd been a regular, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=420.88s)]
*  a regular guest for Russian propaganda TV [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=426.38s)]
*  and said lots of pro-Putin things over an eight-year period. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=431.04s)]
*  150 appearances is not like a hit here and there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=437.24s)]
*  That's like essentially a regular guest. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=441.88s)]
*  That's like if I was, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=444.68s)]
*  it's as if I were nominated to go in the cabinet [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=446.02s)]
*  and I just failed to mention that I'd ever been on MSNBC. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=448.64s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=451.74s)]
*  So. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=452.58s)]
*  Yeah, so, and I think one of the things [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=453.42s)]
*  about Mr. Martin that I find troubling is, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=456.26s)]
*  other people who are nominated for the position [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=458.68s)]
*  don't already hold it, and so at some level, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=460.42s)]
*  it's a little speculative, well, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=462.52s)]
*  what will they do in the job? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=463.62s)]
*  In this case, he was named the acting on day one, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=465.18s)]
*  and I have to say these letters he's been sending, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  here's three different medical journals. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  The Journal of Chest Medicine, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=474.52s)]
*  I want you to respond to the U.S. attorney [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=476.46s)]
*  about whether you have bias. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=478.46s)]
*  Get back to me on that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=480.82s)]
*  Georgetown Law School, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  you have to tell me how you're instructing your kids. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=482.96s)]
*  This is Wikipedia. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=484.88s)]
*  He sent a letter to the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=486.38s)]
*  accusing the tax-exempt organization [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=488.32s)]
*  of allowing foreign actors to manipulate information [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=489.94s)]
*  and spread propaganda to the American public. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=492.42s)]
*  I mean, I have to say these letters strike me [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=494.48s)]
*  as flatly authoritarian as anything we've seen [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=496.74s)]
*  from the Trump administration, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=499.42s)]
*  and one does have to wonder if he were actually confirmed [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=500.98s)]
*  what he would be doing with the prosecutorial power. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=503.84s)]
*  I mean, he calls the hundreds of lawyers [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  who work at the U.S. attorney's office, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=510.64s)]
*  which is a pretty venerated office of prosecutors, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=512.92s)]
*  the president's lawyers, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=516.56s)]
*  and he has openly said that his job is to go out there [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=519.06s)]
*  and attack the critics of the president. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=522.36s)]
*  I have colleagues in Congress [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=524.4799999999999s)]
*  who received threatening letters from Mr. Martin [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=526.4599999999999s)]
*  in his first days in office. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=531.28s)]
*  One of the first things he did was to dismiss cases [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=532.62s)]
*  against his own defendants, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=535.66s)]
*  that is, rather his own clients, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=537.68s)]
*  people who were criminal defendants [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=539.56s)]
*  in the January 6th case. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=541.4599999999999s)]
*  He was there on January 6th, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=543.74s)]
*  and he experienced the events of the day as Mardi Gras, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  he said in a tweet that he sent out [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=549.42s)]
*  as he observed the mass violence against our police officers, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=552.38s)]
*  the attempt to storm the Capitol, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=556.42s)]
*  the storming of the Capitol, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=558.78s)]
*  and then the attempt to overthrow the election, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=560.12s)]
*  as Mardi Gras. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  It was a big day of celebration for him, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=563.22s)]
*  and he has partaken of every form of January 6th [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=565.04s)]
*  denialism and conspiracy theory out there, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=569.14s)]
*  like the FBI director as well, Cash Patel. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChV4MjXgad0&t=571.72s)]
