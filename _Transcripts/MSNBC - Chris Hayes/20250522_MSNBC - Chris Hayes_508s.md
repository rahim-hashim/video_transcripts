# 'Met Gala of pay-for-play’: Trump crypto dinner is brazenly corrupt, says Hayes
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA)
*  But if you think accepting that flatly unconstitutional multimillion dollar personal gift from the Qataris was audacious, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=0.0s)]
*  wait until you hear about Trump's dinner plans for tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=7.0s)]
*  Right now, as I'm speaking to you at this hour, with protesters outside, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=11.0s)]
*  the most brazen act of corruption by a president in our last times, probably in a century, possibly ever, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=15.0s)]
*  is going down in Northern Virginia right now, but not really hiding it so much. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=23.0s)]
*  You can call it the Met Gala of presidential pay for play. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=27.0s)]
*  Now, of course, we are used to hearing about fancy gala dinners where politicians rub elbows with their top campaign donors [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=31.0s)]
*  who are donating often specifically so they can be near those politicians. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=39.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, that's become part and parcel of our political system, and I think people view it with a jaundiced eye, understandably. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=45.0s)]
*  This is not that. Really can't stress that enough. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=53.0s)]
*  This is just totally at another level, entirely different stratosphere of corruption. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=56.0s)]
*  A quote, unforgettable gala dinner with the president at his 800 acre Trump National Golf Resort in Potomac Falls, Virginia, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=64.0s)]
*  for a very exclusive group. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=73.0s)]
*  220 winners of a contest to meet President Trump, the top holders of his crypto coin. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=76.0s)]
*  I don't know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=82.0s)]
*  NBC News has learned each dinner guest paid between fifty five thousand and thirty seven point seven million dollars for the Trump coin. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=86.0s)]
*  Now, remember the day before becoming president, Trump, day before inauguration, launched this meme coin, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=94.0s)]
*  It's the Trump coin. And then this whole dinner thing was announced first back in April. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=101.0s)]
*  It was at W.W.W.W. dot get Trump memes dot com. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=106.0s)]
*  The president's meme coin sought investors who would pour untraceable cash into his crypto wallet. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=111.0s)]
*  And the top two hundred and twenty got an invite to tonight's dinner. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=117.0s)]
*  Black tie optional for the top twenty five Trump meme coin holders. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=121.0s)]
*  There was an exclusive reception with the president before dinner. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=125.0s)]
*  All told, in order to get in tonight's gala, the winning guests forked out a total of nearly four hundred million dollars, according to NBC News. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=128.0s)]
*  This was essentially an open advertised competition to see who would pay the biggest literal tribute to Donald Trump's crypto coin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=137.0s)]
*  And because of the way this meme coin works, which is issued by Trump and his purchase always sends money to the company that he's part of. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=148.0s)]
*  This is really not functionally different than if those guests showed up with satchels of cash or briefcases with stacks of bills and then just dumped all that into a big bucket physically held by the president of the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=157.0s)]
*  Well, the website for the contest says that the president is appearing at the dinner as a guest and not soliciting any funds for it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=175.0s)]
*  Another site says that 80 percent of the Trump coin project is owned by two companies affiliated or in business with Trump. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=183.0s)]
*  Again, as Trump said, I launched the coin, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=191.0s)]
*  These are Trump businesses again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=193.0s)]
*  Now, if these were campaign donations, the level of the donations and the people donating would make this just an absolute facial violation of every campaign finance law ever. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=196.0s)]
*  But again, it's even worse than that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=206.0s)]
*  This is not going towards Donald Trump's political campaigns or, you know, his super PAC. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=208.0s)]
*  No, no, no. This is just money in the president's business empire. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=213.0s)]
*  And when asked, the White House keeps saying that Donald Trump, the president United States, is not attending this dinner where he will that he's attending this dinner where he will make millions of dollars, not as president, but in his personal capacity. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=220.0s)]
*  On the president's dinner tonight, will the White House commit to making a list of the attendees public so people can see who's paying for that kind of access to the president? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=235.0s)]
*  Well, as you know, Gareth, this question has been raised with the president. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=244.0s)]
*  I have also addressed the dinner tonight. The president is attending it in his personal time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=248.0s)]
*  It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=253.0s)]
*  So that's a no, I think, on the list of attendees. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=257.0s)]
*  You don't really have to understand crypto to see how this works. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=260.0s)]
*  You just need to understand people like Justin Sun. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=263.0s)]
*  OK, here's just one example. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=266.0s)]
*  Justin Sun is a Chinese born crypto billionaire whose company has been a popular way to move money for crypto's criminal underbelly. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=268.0s)]
*  And for years, Justin Sun wouldn't even set foot in the US for fear of arrest, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=276.0s)]
*  Also, he was under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Treasury, as well as a lawsuit that was filed by the SEC. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=283.0s)]
*  But guess where Sun is tonight? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=291.0s)]
*  Really nice to be here today with everybody in the crypto to witness this great moment of crypto. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=294.0s)]
*  And the president will be on the stage later. So see you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=311.0s)]
*  See you, Justin. He's there tonight. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=317.0s)]
*  He's there tonight. In fact, in addition to being the top Trump coin investor, Sun also went in with the Trump family on a separate investment last year and all told he has sunk at least $93 million into Trump crypto ventures, according to CNBC. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=319.0s)]
*  And would you believe this is really going to come as a shock in February, right after Trump took office? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=334.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you know the SEC asked a court to pause its lawsuit against Sun. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=340.0s)]
*  So it filed a lawsuit in the previous administration and then Sun went into business in crypto with Trump and then Trump got elected. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=346.0s)]
*  And then a few weeks later, the SEC is like, we want to pause this lawsuit. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=354.0s)]
*  Now, instead of quietly counting his blessings for appearing to have successfully wriggled out what could have been some legal trouble, Sun tweeted that he was Trump's top meme coin donor. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=358.0s)]
*  What's the emoji for a victory laugh? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=368.0s)]
*  Now, we only know Sun is at tonight's gala because he bragged about it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=371.0s)]
*  In fact, the identities of most of the other contest winners are largely private. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=374.0s)]
*  They use pseudonyms to purchase their Trump meme coins. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=378.0s)]
*  But, and this is really important, a majority of the attendees appear to be foreign nationals, according to Molly White, an independent crypto researcher who has written about the contest. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=381.0s)]
*  Again, foreigners cannot legally donate to an actual US campaign. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=390.0s)]
*  In normal times, the Department of State is in charge of stopping and sanctioning foreigners who donate to American political campaigns. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=395.0s)]
*  But as Secretary of State Marco Rubio made clear this week, we're not in normal times. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=401.0s)]
*  Do you have a list of those foreign individuals who will be meeting with the president? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=406.0s)]
*  I don't. I don't know anything about it. I don't even know there was a dinner. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=412.0s)]
*  It is likely going to involve some very significant foreign interests. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=415.0s)]
*  You have to be pretty wealthy in order to be able to get inside this dinner. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=420.0s)]
*  Isn't that a relevant question for the Secretary of State? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=424.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not the social secretary. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=427.0s)]
*  Which foreign interests are going to be speaking to the president? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=428.0s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of naive to believe that they aren't going to be in that room talking about national security matters. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=430.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think that that's the case at all because I would be aware of it was the case. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=435.0s)]
*  Oh, well, that's a pretty good tautological reasoning. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=439.0s)]
*  They won't be because I would be aware of it if that were the case and I'm not aware of it, therefore they won't be. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=441.0s)]
*  Just the president of the United States being a guest at a dinner where a bidding war helped decide who gets invited based on how much untraceable cash they forked over to Donald Trump's meme coin. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=449.0s)]
*  A crypto scheme that, according to estimates, has enabled him to make hundreds of millions of dollars off of being president in just a few months. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=459.0s)]
*  For Donald Trump, regaining the presidency was always fundamentally, I think, about two things. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=467.0s)]
*  One, most crucially, avoiding jail for the many crimes that he was indicted for. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=471.0s)]
*  And making as much money as he can. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=478.0s)]
*  And we've known that for a long time, but the audacity and the scale of his profiteering can still be managed to be shocking. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8EJ6iMzpA&t=480.0s)]
