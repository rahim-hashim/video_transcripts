# 'TACO Tuesday': Democrats hand out free tacos to troll Trump over tariff jab
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w)
*  Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the taco trade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=0.0s)]
*  They're saying Trump always chickens out on your tariff threats, and that's why markets [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=3.64s)]
*  are higher this week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=8.64s)]
*  I kick out? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=10.0s)]
*  Chicken out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=11.0s)]
*  Oh, and then I chicken out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=12.0s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  We are 62 days into the trade war Donald Trump launched on April 2nd, and we're still waiting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=16.44s)]
*  around for any actual deals to be signed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=22.48s)]
*  Today the White House said Donald Trump signed an order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  against almost all of our trading partners. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=30.04s)]
*  And as concerns about rising prices and uncertainty grow, Reuters reports that the administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=33.0s)]
*  sent out a letter asking trade partners to come negotiate by tomorrow. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=37.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are pressing the Trump always chickens out narrative, handing out [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=42.08s)]
*  free tacos from a truck emblazoned with that very phrase, Trump always chickens out, near [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=46.28s)]
*  the RNC's Washington headquarters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=52.08s)]
*  And the facts are that the free tacos actually ran out pretty quickly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=54.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Jared Bernstein, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=58.12s)]
*  under President Biden. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=62.92s)]
*  Jared, thanks for being here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=64.4s)]
*  Trump and his people promised us 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=66.4s)]
*  So what happened here? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=70.44s)]
*  When will the rubber meet the road? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=72.56s)]
*  That was a completely unrealistic promise to state the obvious. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=75.36s)]
*  It actually takes quite a while to negotiate these trade deals. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=78.68s)]
*  I mean, you talk about the European Union, where Trump threatened a 50 percent tariff [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=82.52s)]
*  before he quickly backed off. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  So sticking with the taco theme, there's 27 countries in the EU, and they don't all [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=89.0s)]
*  think exactly the same. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=94.16s)]
*  So they've been off more than they can chew, and they know that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=95.92s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons why they've often been looking for off-ramps to get out of this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  policy that's been so problematic for the economy, so very unpopular with businesses, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=103.96s)]
*  with markets, with consumers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=109.84s)]
*  It's also going to raise consumer prices. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=111.96s)]
*  So I do think that they're often looking for off-ramps. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=113.72s)]
*  This administration, though, has positioned the on-ramp, off-ramp thing as all part of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=117.28s)]
*  a strategy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=122.96s)]
*  Chaos is part of a good negotiation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=124.6s)]
*  But what does the chaos mean for the businesses, the employers impacted by all of this, and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  for the people that they employ? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=134.72s)]
*  Well, if your strategy is chaos, then I guess people can't accuse you of being chaotic. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=138.12s)]
*  But in fact, that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=145.16s)]
*  And what we know very well, Antonio, is that businesses find this extremely problematic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=148.68s)]
*  They're sitting on their hands when it comes to making deals, like investing in a new warehouse, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=154.7s)]
*  like investing in a new chain of a particular product. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=159.6s)]
*  I mean, let's talk about this steel tariff for a second. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=162.6s)]
*  A 50 percent tariff on steel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=165.24s)]
*  That is a huge monkey wrench in our economy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=168.24s)]
*  And I read a good article today pointing out that this would actually raise the price of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=171.24s)]
*  groceries. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  I think when many of us think of steel, we're thinking of refrigerators and cars. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  And yes, those prices would go up a lot. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=181.28s)]
*  But what about soup cans and beer and tuna fish and that sort of thing? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=183.44s)]
*  It would also raise prices at the groceries. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=187.08s)]
*  And we have producers already building those price hikes in. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=190.0s)]
*  We're going to see higher inflation on the back of these tariffs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=193.44s)]
*  So the chaos is terrible for business. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  The tariffs are terrible for prices. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=199.64s)]
*  How quickly do you think consumers will actually start feeling all of what you just laid out there? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=201.92s)]
*  I think it's coming really in a matter of weeks, if not months. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  We know that some of our largest chains have said they're going to have to raise prices. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  A lot of this comes off the back of the China tariff, which is actually a good point. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=220.04s)]
*  I want to stop that for a second. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=224.16s)]
*  We talk about this Trump always chickens out trade, and I get it from the perspective of markets. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=226.12s)]
*  He may say something in the morning and change by the afternoon. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=230.12s)]
*  But let us not be overly kind of misled by that in the sense that we have very large [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  and significant tariffs that are on this economy right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  The 30 percent tariff on China is really wreaking havoc with small businesses. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Many of them are already—you asked about timing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=249.22000000000003s)]
*  Many of them are already talking about whether they can even keep their doors open if they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=251.48s)]
*  facing a 30 percent tariff on imports from China. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=256.16s)]
*  Speaking of China, Trump is reportedly very obsessed with getting on the phone with Xi [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=260.2s)]
*  any moment now, they keep telling us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=265.04s)]
*  Is he in a strong position in those conversations, if they do in fact even happen in the next [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=268.06s)]
*  couple of days? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=274.72s)]
*  Or does China have the upper hand against him right now? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=275.72s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=279.8s)]
*  And if you'd asked me a week or so ago, I might have given you a different answer. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  I think Trump's in a tough position with China. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  First of all, China isn't exactly interested in backing down. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=286.88s)]
*  China is a very large exporter to the rest of the world. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  Interestingly, China produces a lot of steel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  They sell very little of it here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  Most of the steel they produce, they sell elsewhere. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  But the reason my answer might change to be a little tougher on the Trump administration [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=302.06s)]
*  has to do with some of the legal rulings that have come down. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=307.32s)]
*  Now, we know that that Court of International Trade ruling that prohibited, that said Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=309.72s)]
*  massively overstepped when it came to those large reciprocal tariffs, they stopped all [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=314.36s)]
*  of that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=320.52s)]
*  Of course, that decision was paused. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=321.52s)]
*  But when it was paused, when the appellate court paused that decision, it didn't say [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=323.76s)]
*  the decision's wrong. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=327.2s)]
*  It didn't say we're going to reverse it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=328.36s)]
*  It just said we're going to slow down and take a look at it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=330.3s)]
*  So if I'm negotiating with you and you're under a legal constraint like that, you've [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=332.28s)]
*  got a real disadvantage. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=344.44s)]
*  Jared Bernstein, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=347.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=350.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6XPZnbr37w&t=362.28s)]
