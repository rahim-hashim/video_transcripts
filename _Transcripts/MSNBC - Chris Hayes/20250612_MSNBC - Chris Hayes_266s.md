# ‘It’s time’: Elizabeth Warren calls on Noem to resign after Padilla incident
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg)
*  This morning, a U.S. senator who tried to ask a question of the Secretary of Homeland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=0.0s)]
*  Security was shoved, manhandled, pushed to the ground, handcuffed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  There was no apology forthcoming from the administration. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=12.18s)]
*  They lied about what he did, saying he didn't identify. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=14.56s)]
*  And I saw U.S. senators—this is one of your own—how—what's your reaction to this? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=17.92s)]
*  How big a deal does it feel like to you? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=27.16s)]
*  Is this, oh, it was a mistake in identity, they didn't know, they were following their [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  training, or does this feel like something bigger? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=32.84s)]
*  No, this is bigger than that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=35.8s)]
*  I mean, first you have to focus on why was Senator Padilla handcuffed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=38.08s)]
*  He was handcuffed for asking a question. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  He was handcuffed for doing his job as a senator. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  You know, you've got to remind everyone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=50.84s)]
*  What's our job? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=53.0s)]
*  Our job in the Senate is to do legislation, to do the nominations, and to conduct oversight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=54.0s)]
*  And oversight is about asking hard questions, questions that are uncomfortable. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=59.88s)]
*  Look, I've done a fair amount of that myself. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=64.72s)]
*  And I've done it in Democratic administrations and Republican administrations, because that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=67.84s)]
*  is my job. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=72.6s)]
*  In the Constitution, Congress has a job. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=73.6s)]
*  oversight about how any administration is enforcing the law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=78.2s)]
*  So there's Alex Padilla, the senator from California. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=84.0s)]
*  He represents the people of Los Angeles. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=88.92s)]
*  We've watched what's happening in Los Angeles, what Donald Trump is doing, possibly not legally, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  bringing in the National Guard, bringing in the Marines. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  And so Alex Padilla is there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=102.48s)]
*  We've got the head of Homeland Security who wants to come out to California, the person [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=104.52s)]
*  who's in charge of ICE, who's in charge of these escalating efforts that ICE has been [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=108.84s)]
*  using on civilian populations, snatching people off the streets here in Massachusetts, lurking [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=117.69999999999999s)]
*  outside elementary schools in California. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=124.64s)]
*  So she's there to take credit for what's going on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  They're having an open, they're having a press conference, cameras are rolling. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=131.46s)]
*  And Alex Padilla wants to ask a question, and he gets thrown to the floor and handcuffed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=136.46s)]
*  for it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=142.74s)]
*  And then the Trump administration just wants to gaslight everybody and somehow try to blame [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  the senator for that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=150.22s)]
*  All I can say is anyone who isn't already convinced that the Trump administration is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=151.38s)]
*  trying to undermine free speech in this country, trying to shut down anyone who doesn't agree [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=158.08s)]
*  with Donald Trump and doesn't bend a knee to Donald Trump, anyone who doesn't believe [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  that that's what the Trump administration is doing, needs to watch that video of Senator [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=170.44s)]
*  Padilla being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed simply for trying to ask a question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why this is a big deal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=185.08s)]
*  So a lot of Democratic senators have stood up and said, enough, I want to hear where [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=187.06s)]
*  the Republican senators are, because anyone in the position that Donald Trump is in who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=191.88s)]
*  is willing to do this with a senator and back it up, Kristi Noem in there ready to back [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=198.02s)]
*  up and no apology, trying to defend herself and lie about what happened, anyone who's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=203.88s)]
*  willing to do that is willing to do it to you, to anyone else in this country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=209.22s)]
*  It is time for Republican senators to speak up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=215.8s)]
*  We need an independent investigation of this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  It is time also for Kristi Noem to resign. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=222.24s)]
*  She needs to resign. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=225.78s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren, you've been incredibly generous and gracious with your time tonight [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=226.78s)]
*  on an extremely busy night and it's been excellent to have your insight here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  So I really appreciate you joining the program tonight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEu5K-x1ADg&t=238.82000000000002s)]
