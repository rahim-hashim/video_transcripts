# ‘Gone too far’: New evidence Trump, Stephen Miller are losing the battle over ICE raids
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU)
*  What the Trump administration is currently doing day by day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=0.0s)]
*  Throughout American cities is so violent and defensible neighbors being chased and wrestled the ground folks being asked to show their papers [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=3.68s)]
*  That Americans and masks are getting fed up. We've got some new data to show you tonight [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=10.96s)]
*  Take for example, Los Angeles this whole week was filled with masked [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=16.6s)]
*  Heavily armed officers of ICE and Border Patrol [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=21.72s)]
*  Rolling up on flea markets Home Depot parking lots Walmart's even Dodger Stadium in search of immigrants to arrest [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=25.32s)]
*  In fact, there has been no unrest in LA for over a week none whatsoever [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=33.48s)]
*  And yet Trump still has thousands of Marines and National Guard soldiers patrolling the streets [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=39.0s)]
*  Today Trump was gloating over an appellate court decision that for now allows him to continue to deploy [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=45.84s)]
*  California's National Guard to LA over [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=51.84s)]
*  The repeated objections of Governor Gavin Newsom [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Also today vice president JD Vance traveled to LA to take his tour of the city [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=57.32s)]
*  This is you know a week and a half or more after the burning of the way most that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=62.56s)]
*  Precipitated the sending in the troops. That's the guy you'll remember [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=67.36s)]
*  Spread the lie that migrants in Ohio were eating animals off the street last year and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=71.44s)]
*  He used his remarks moments ago to spread the lie that California is a leftist rogue state that deserves the police state treatment [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  We have a public official in Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=84.64s)]
*  Who over the past few years have actively encouraged illegal migration into this community? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  I landed when I saw this city when I was driving through [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  To come to this FBI building all I could think about is what a great American City, Los Angeles is and what a great [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=100.36s)]
*  Tragedy it is that we have allowed illegal immigration and rioting to destroy [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=107.56s)]
*  I think one of the great gems of American of the American family [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=112.22s)]
*  Oh really that that's what went through your head as you drove in your huge security cordon to go to the FBI building [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=116.78s)]
*  Two weeks after some people burned a few way most [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=123.02s)]
*  Thanks for that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=128.14s)]
*  That profound take on LA mr. Vice president by the way amazing moment [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=129.46s)]
*  He called the senator from California Alex Padilla Jose Padilla today during that press conference [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Also took no questions from local reporters [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=140.18s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass is expected to respond the vice president at a press conference in this hour will tell you what she says when that happens [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=143.22s)]
*  But here's the thing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=149.9s)]
*  To put it simply what the Trump administration is doing right now what Stephen Miller and Donald Trump are doing is gross and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=151.78s)]
*  It's also not working because what they're attempting is a kind of confidence game to mask the weakness of what they're doing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=159.42s)]
*  Because guess what people hate this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=165.42s)]
*  I mean JD Vance one of the most cravenly cynical figures [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  I've ever seen in American life love to spend a lot of time congratulating himself for looking out for the interests of US citizens [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=171.38s)]
*  While his straw men foes allegedly don't care about Americans, but what have we seen in LA really mr. Vice president? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  we've seen video after video of American citizens and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=184.82s)]
*  Their friends and their family and their neighbors the people that are part of American citizens lives being ordered to present their papers and being [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=188.7s)]
*  grabbed and wrestled to the ground and detained [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=196.72s)]
*  Including elected officials that guy Alex Padilla not Jose. Mr. Vice president and we keep seeing Americans [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=200.16s)]
*  Non-violently confronting those masked armed agents wherever they go [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=208.44s)]
*  Like employees of a Walmart that was raided in LA County on Tuesday [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=212.96s)]
*  One of them recorded his colleague again a US citizen, right an American in good standing. Mr [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=216.68s)]
*  Vance getting shoved [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=223.24s)]
*  Then swarmed and then arrested for allegedly punching the masked agents who swarmed him [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=225.04s)]
*  Look [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=255.04s)]
*  Now what I just wants you to believe is that the unarmed man in the blue vest was the aggressor in that video in that incident [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=270.32s)]
*  not the dozens of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=277.68s)]
*  Heavily armed men in war camo, okay [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=280.2s)]
*  Even the Los Angeles Fox affiliate pointed out the Walmart security video showed no punches and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=284.14s)]
*  We've seen more scenes like this scene that nearly replicated in a raid at the Hollywood Home Depot [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  You guys you guys you coming to work [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  You know what [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=319.94s)]
*  Americans have a right to do that in this free country American citizens have a right to do that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=321.44s)]
*  They have a right to not be roughed up [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  by masked men holding long guns [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=328.26s)]
*  You know, even the country's most pop most popular pro Trump podcaster [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=331.7s)]
*  Joe Rogan much has been made about his support for Donald Trump during the campaign [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=335.5s)]
*  Made a pretty important point this week that American voters the vast majority of them did not vote for this [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=339.54s)]
*  If they the Trump administration if they're running and they said we're gonna go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=347.74s)]
*  Home Depot, we're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just like tackle people at constructions [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=353.66s)]
*  I don't think anybody was signed up for that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=359.14s)]
*  And now we're we're seeing like Home Depots get raided like that's crazy it is crazy [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=364.3s)]
*  I mean, that's what Stephen Miller wants. He wants to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=371.02s)]
*  Construct a police state so as to abduct [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=374.34s)]
*  incarcerate and deport 13 million people and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  Yet despite all the protests from every part of the political spectrum Trump's border patrols making propaganda videos of its armed agents [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=381.9s)]
*  Locking and loading for warfare in full military fatigues and body armor mass to raid a suburban flea market [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=388.68s)]
*  and ask patrons where they are from [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=396.96s)]
*  Again the administration thinks all this plays to Trump's strengths. I mean you can see like [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=401.36s)]
*  Stephen Miller like popping a vein in his head how much he enjoys this [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=407.32s)]
*  Yet get this ready [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=412.36s)]
*  Trump's polling on immigration [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=414.52s)]
*  Historically one of his strongest issues genuinely a huge strength [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=416.36s)]
*  During the campaign. There's no question. It's nose-diving [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=420.24s)]
*  Quinnipiac poll earlier this month earlier this month showed Trump underwater by 11 points on immigration [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  54% disapprove and when you narrow the question down to Trump's deportation policy, the numbers are even worse for him [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=429.8s)]
*  He is underwater by 16 points. Those polls were taken before Trump moved [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=436.04s)]
*  Marines and National Guard in Los Angeles [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=442.0s)]
*  But every major poll since them from NBC News from Reuters shows the same trend [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=443.8s)]
*  voters are rejecting Trump's police state because it is un-American and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=449.76s)]
*  It's not just you know localized Los Angeles. These scenes are playing on local television [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=454.36s)]
*  Every night across the country. Here's one in Chicago where two American soldiers again American citizens [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=459.76s)]
*  Volunteered to physically protect their mother from ice [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  We hear stories of people showing up for standard case checkups only to find themselves [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  Taken into custody by ice agents two members of the National Guard seen here [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=476.24s)]
*  Decided to accompany their mother to her Chicago immigration appointment [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  We fear that she might get taken into custody there's been reports of that they get it on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=490.84s)]
*  Attacks they're an appointment. They have to come in and they end up getting detained [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=496.52s)]
*  Putting their own bodies in front of their mom in uniform to prevent her from being snatched by the secret police [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=501.24s)]
*  Now that's the same thing by the way that New York City controller Brad Lander was doing for migrants in the city when federal agents [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=506.84s)]
*  roughed him up and cuffed him this week [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=511.56s)]
*  Similar activities are now being bolstered by the first US Bishop appointed by Pope Leo Michael Pham [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=514.1999999999999s)]
*  Who came to this country as a refugee from Vietnam when he was 13? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=519.8s)]
*  Sent a letter to fellow priests in Southern California [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=523.64s)]
*  Encouraging them to show up in federal buildings today world refugee day and support immigrants in their immigration hearings [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=526.2s)]
*  According to reporters in San Diego due to Bishop Pham's presence in the courtroom cases of immigrants today were effectively postponed [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=533.32s)]
*  Unless you think this is this same sentiment isn't rampant among normies [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=541.4s)]
*  Consider the fact that one of America's top professional wrestlers Brody King [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=546.2s)]
*  Consider the fact that one of America's top professional wrestlers Brody King [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=549.24s)]
*  Showed up to a match in Mexico City Wednesday night wearing a tank top that said abolish ice [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=552.84s)]
*  I'm going to say this slowly and clearly because it's important and there's a lot of misdirection on this [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=560.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and Stephen Miller are on the wrong side of public opinion on this and they're losing badly in the court of public opinion [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=566.12s)]
*  Their answer as always is to up the ante [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=573.24s)]
*  More shows of force more masked agents more lies, but the more they lean into the cruelty the less popular it all is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=575.56s)]
*  You [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hl6SirHAKU&t=605.56s)]
