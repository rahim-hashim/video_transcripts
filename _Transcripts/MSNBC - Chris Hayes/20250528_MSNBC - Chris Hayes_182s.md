# Trump’s FEMA denies North Carolina’s request for Hurricane Helene aid
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0)
*  Last year when Donald Trump was running for president and Hurricane Helene, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=0.0s)]
*  remember that one ripped through several states including North Carolina, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=3.88s)]
*  Trump made some very serious promises to the people there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=6.84s)]
*  Think of it, people are dying in North Carolina, they're dying all over those five, six states. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=10.44s)]
*  They're dying and they're getting no help from our federal government [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=18.6s)]
*  because they have no money, because their money's been spent on people that should not be in our country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=22.8s)]
*  And when our president, North Carolina, will get the support you need and deserve, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=28.88s)]
*  and that is without question, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=33.28s)]
*  because you didn't get the proper support from this administration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  They spent their money on illegal migrants. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=40.92s)]
*  I will support and totally complete the rebuilding of every region and town and city [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=44.04s)]
*  that was devastated by the hurricane and I will slash through every bureaucratic barrier that you're having already. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=49.04s)]
*  Now, President Trump is president again, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=57.12s)]
*  so you might reasonably expect him to deliver on this grave promise [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  to give North Carolina and the other impacted states the support they need and deserve. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=62.12s)]
*  Well, instead, the governor of North Carolina received this letter [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  after his state was denied additional federal support back in April. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=69.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's FEMA writes, postmarked May 22nd, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=74.8s)]
*  after a careful and thorough review of all the information available, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=78.48s)]
*  we've concluded that an extension of the 100% federal cost share for debris removal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=81.08s)]
*  and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 100 days, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=85.88s)]
*  is not warranted. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=90.96s)]
*  Tough. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Too bad. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=94.32s)]
*  This is amid the Trump administration's effort to dismantle and destroy FEMA as an agency. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=96.0s)]
*  And that is not hyperbole. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=101.08s)]
*  In January, Trump said literally, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to recommend that FEMA go away. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=104.64s)]
*  After torring the damage in North Carolina, days later in wildfire ravage California, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=107.96s)]
*  you don't need FEMA. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=114.0s)]
*  You need a good state government. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=115.0s)]
*  In furtherance of that goal, Trump tapped David Richardson to lead FEMA, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=116.96s)]
*  a guy who, according to The Wall Street Journal, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=121.16s)]
*  Why would you need one? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Earlier this month, Richardson also reportedly acknowledged in private meetings [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  that with two weeks to go until hurricane season, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  the agency didn't yet have a fully formed disaster response plan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=134.12s)]
*  Hurricane season begins on June 1st. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=140.88s)]
*  It's three days away. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=142.96s)]
*  It's unclear what, if any, federal help vulnerable states will get to prepare for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=144.96s)]
*  and recover from what forecasters predict will be an above average hurricane season. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-GVdML8Nf0&t=148.8s)]
