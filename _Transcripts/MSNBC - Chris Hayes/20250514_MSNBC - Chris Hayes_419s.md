Video Description: “When you throw 13 million people off health insurance, when you raise co-payments for poor people, it is a death sentence,” says Senator Bernie Sanders on the Republican plan to cut Medicaid. “Thousands and thousands of low-income and working people will die because they simply will not be able to get into a doctor’s office when they need it.”

# ‘Death sentence’: Sen. Sanders on GOP Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM)
*  Joining me now, someone who spent decades on the front line of the fight to preserve [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=0.0s)]
*  Medicaid, along with other government programs, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=3.44s)]
*  Let's start with the characterization there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=9.08s)]
*  I thought that was succinct. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=11.36s)]
*  He calls them cuts. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=12.88s)]
*  I call them savings. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=14.0s)]
*  The line that they're giving about these big cuts to Medicaid is that there are work requirements, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=15.68s)]
*  that there's too many able-bodied people laying around getting free healthcare. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=20.96s)]
*  We believe welfare dependency, not work, is the barrier. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=25.44s)]
*  That's an op-ed from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a mem-at-oz. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=28.24s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=31.36s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=33.08s)]
*  The overwhelming ... We're going to be looking at $715 billion in cuts to Medicaid and to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=34.08s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=43.32s)]
*  That means, Chris, that over 13 ... According to the CBO, over 13 million Americans are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  going to lose their health insurance. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=52.5s)]
*  Then on top of that, what the Republicans are proposing is a $35 copayment for many [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=54.96s)]
*  Medicaid recipients. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  If you are making $16,000 a year, you know what? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=65.4s)]
*  You can't afford that 35 bucks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=69.78s)]
*  You are not going to go to the doctor. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=72.12s)]
*  One of the outrageous dysfunctionalities of our current healthcare system is we lose some [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=74.76s)]
*  70,000 people a year die because they don't get to a doctor on time. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=82.24s)]
*  When you throw 13 million people off of health insurance, when you raise copayments for poor [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=87.16s)]
*  people, it is a death sentence. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=92.16s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of low-income and working people will die because they simply [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=95.16s)]
*  will not be able to get into a doctor's office when they need it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=99.64s)]
*  One of the interesting dynamics to me, having covered government healthcare and these fights [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=103.72s)]
*  for a while, is the kind of recipe Republicans tend to use in these budget fights goes the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=108.2s)]
*  following. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, they are taxing you to pay for something for these other people, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  We are going to cut your taxes, and these freeloaders aren't going to be able to take [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=119.2s)]
*  advantage of the system. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=122.86s)]
*  It is interesting to me how Medicaid has moved from a thing that they could make that argument [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=124.4s)]
*  about easily, back when I first started covering politics, to something that feels politically [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  a lot more like Medicare. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=135.56s)]
*  People understand how used it, necessary it is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=140.16s)]
*  Does it feel that way to you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=143.12s)]
*  It has more political power. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=144.44s)]
*  I think that is a very, very valid point, and I think that has a lot to do with a couple [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=145.44s)]
*  of factors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=150.56s)]
*  Number one, the healthcare crisis is absolutely acute. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=152.8s)]
*  You have millions and millions of people that even have health insurance, can't find a doctor, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=157.36s)]
*  can't afford their deductibles to pay when their deductible is high. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=162.92s)]
*  So you have a crisis right now in Medicaid, which covers some 70 million people, is a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=168.28s)]
*  lifesaver for those people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Number two, Medicaid provides about 60% of the funding for nursing homes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=177.16s)]
*  So you have a mom or a dad in a nursing home where you need to put them in a nursing home, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=184.92s)]
*  that's Medicaid. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=189.6s)]
*  And thirdly, Medicaid provides substantial amounts of money for community health centers. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=191.36s)]
*  30 million people go to community health centers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=196.08s)]
*  You need that primary healthcare, Medicaid is there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  So Medicaid is playing a role like Medicare in providing care to millions of people the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=201.36s)]
*  average American does not want to see it cut. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=206.4s)]
*  So you've got, you know, Josh always said don't cut Medicaid, although it looks like [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=209.0s)]
*  they're going to give themselves wiggle room, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  They're going to define them as things that aren't cuts. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  And then I want to play you something. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=216.8s)]
*  Ron Johnson, Republican colleague in Wisconsin, he's been saying this thing's doomed to fail. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=218.32s)]
*  It's not going to get enough support in the Senate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what he's at. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=225.2s)]
*  He seems to be thinking they're not cutting things enough. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  But I want to play this for you and get your read on how much this is a bluff and how much [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=229.04s)]
*  this is real. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=233.76s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=234.76s)]
*  He only has so much time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=237.04s)]
*  But again, I don't want to undermine his strategy because unlike others who are hoping he fails, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=238.04s)]
*  I hope he succeeds. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=242.7s)]
*  I hope he succeeds spectacularly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=243.7s)]
*  I hope all my concerns are alleviated. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=246.6s)]
*  But again, so that's why my primary focus is spending, spending, spending, spending. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=250.12s)]
*  But we can focus on the thing we can do, which is we need to reduce spending to a reasonable [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=255.48s)]
*  pre-pandemic level. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=260.68s)]
*  And we're not doing that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=261.68s)]
*  Johnson said basically we're not cutting enough spending. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=264.64s)]
*  I'm not going to vote for this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=266.76s)]
*  I've got a bunch of other Republicans who won't. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  I tend to think that talk is cheap. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=270.32s)]
*  But what do you think about what's going on here? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=272.88s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=274.56s)]
*  At the end of the day, Trump's pressure on them and Musk's money on them, if they don't [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=275.56s)]
*  support it, they're going to get primaried. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=284.48s)]
*  And Musk has unlimited amounts of money to spend against them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=286.8s)]
*  I think that will likely prevail. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=289.0s)]
*  But the idea that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, in a bill which we're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=292.16s)]
*  going to provide $660 billion in tax breaks for the top 1%, the idea that we're not cutting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=301.08s)]
*  programs for working people and poor people is absolutely asinine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=308.56s)]
*  You have been on this tour. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=314.64s)]
*  You've been talking about this a lot with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  others, the Fight Oligarchy Tour. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=320.36s)]
*  You've put out, I mean, crazy numbers of people, I mean, over 10,000 in Denver and folks in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=322.24s)]
*  34,000 in Denver, as a matter of fact. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=328.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=330.64s)]
*  Thanks for the correction. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=331.64s)]
*  I was just pulling that from back there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=332.64s)]
*  34,000 in Denver, huge numbers of people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=335.0s)]
*  What is it, have you been surprised by those numbers? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=338.0s)]
*  And what does it say to you? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=341.88s)]
*  Well, look, remember, this is not some kind of presidential campaign. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=342.88s)]
*  There is no election, not running for anything. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=347.28s)]
*  People are coming out in huge numbers because they are deeply concerned and frightened about [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=350.56s)]
*  what's happening in this country, and they want to see Democrats stand up and fight back [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  in a very aggressive way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=362.66s)]
*  So number one, they're worried about the growing authoritarianism of the Trump administration. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=364.74s)]
*  They're worried about the kleptocracy of the Trump administration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=370.44s)]
*  And they're worried about what we just talked about, massive tax breaks for billionaires, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=374.42s)]
*  while 60% of our people living paycheck to paycheck and ordinary Americans struggling [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  just to put food on the table. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=384.28s)]
*  So the American people look at all of this and they'll say, what the hell is going on? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=386.36s)]
*  We want a government that represents not just the billionaire class and the oligarchs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=391.02s)]
*  We want a government that represents all of us. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=395.4s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcNjq-v7HVM&t=397.88s)]
