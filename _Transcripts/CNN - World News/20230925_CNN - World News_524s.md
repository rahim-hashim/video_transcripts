# 'Pretty big deal': Retired general on Ukraine's claim about Russian admiral
**CNN - World News:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU)
*  19 months into its war, Ukraine claiming a major blow against Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukrainian special forces say the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was killed in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=6.24s)]
*  last week's attack on Sevastopol in Crimea. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=11.64s)]
*  Let's get you straight to CNN's Frederick Pleitkin, who is in eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=15.08s)]
*  And we are just getting word of this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=20.16s)]
*  What do we know at this point? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=22.32s)]
*  Yeah, this comes from Ukrainian military intelligence, Becky, and they're saying that in that strike [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=24.28s)]
*  on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters, which of course happened in the early morning hours [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=29.08s)]
*  of this past Friday, and that really hit that headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=33.16s)]
*  The Ukrainians are saying that 34 senior officers, as they put it, of the Black Sea Fleet were [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=38.4s)]
*  killed, including the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, who's an admiral called Viktor [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=42.8s)]
*  Sokolov. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  The Ukrainians are saying that he was killed in that strike. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Of course, you'll recall that after that strike took place, there was some video that emerged [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  on social media. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=55.92s)]
*  Very close, actually, to the town of Sevastopol, to the center of the town of Sevastopol. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  Many people, of course, had their phones out, may have been filming. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=61.68s)]
*  It certainly seemed as though there were cruise missiles that hit that Black Sea Fleet headquarters. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  The Russians at that point in time only acknowledged that one Russian soldier was missing, was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=69.36s)]
*  presumably killed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=75.04s)]
*  They did acknowledge, as they put it, that the historic headquarters of the Black Sea [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=76.4s)]
*  Fleet had been hit, but had not said that officers had been killed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=80.08s)]
*  Now, we do have to say, Becky, that at this point in time, the Ukrainians have not put [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=84.52s)]
*  forward any evidence to firm up the fact that Admiral Sokolov may have been killed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=87.96s)]
*  It's very difficult, obviously, to confirm that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=93.72s)]
*  We ourselves have not been able to independently confirm that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  We have been trying to get in touch with the Russian defense ministry about this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=99.32s)]
*  And earlier today, there was a call with journalists by the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=103.2s)]
*  where this was also not talked about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=107.8s)]
*  So right now, we don't have any sort of confirmation or indications about this from the Russians. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=109.84s)]
*  Nevertheless, of course, a big claim by the Ukrainians. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=114.5s)]
*  And it came as there were a range of strikes on Sevastopol and the area around Sevastopol [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  in this past week by the Ukrainians, them, of course, hitting a submarine that was in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=122.86s)]
*  the dry dock there in Sevastopol, also hitting a landing ship called the Minsk, which was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=126.9s)]
*  outside of the port of Sevastopol. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=132.34s)]
*  The Ukrainians also saying that a lot of sailors were killed on that ship as they claimed that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=135.3s)]
*  it was about to set sail for a mission. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=139.7s)]
*  So certainly, the Ukrainians this past week, putting pressure on the Russian Black Sea [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=142.54s)]
*  fleet, putting pressure on the Russians in occupied Crimea, now coming up with this big [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=146.94s)]
*  claim. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  But again, at this point in time, all of this not confirmed, Becky. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  Fred overnight, Russia hit Odessa with a barrage of drone strikes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=157.22s)]
*  Is it clear what the extent of the damage is at this point? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, it seems to be pretty extensive damage, but it's unclear how big a hit this was against [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=167.94s)]
*  the Ukrainians. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=173.82s)]
*  Of course, Odessa, much like Sevastopol, also a port town. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=174.82s)]
*  So the Ukrainians are saying they believe that this was retaliation for the Ukrainians [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=177.1s)]
*  hitting the port of Sevastopol this past Friday. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=180.9s)]
*  In fact, the Ukrainians calling this pathetic retaliation in their words. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=182.98s)]
*  They say that in total, the Russians used 14 cruise missiles and 19 drones for this attack. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians say they were able to shoot down those 19 drones, but they said the cruise [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=193.1s)]
*  missile part of the attack in itself was very complex. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=197.06s)]
*  12 of those cruise missiles were caliber cruise missiles. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=200.22s)]
*  Those are cruise missiles that can maneuver but travel at a subsonic speed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=203.54s)]
*  The Ukrainians say they were able to shoot down 11 of those 12 cruise missiles, some [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=207.54s)]
*  of them in the vicinity of Odessa. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=211.46s)]
*  But they said that two of the cruise missiles that were used were Onyx cruise missiles. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=213.62s)]
*  Those travel supersonic and those appear to have hit some of the targets there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=217.28s)]
*  The Ukrainians are saying that grain facilities were hit in the port of Odessa, and they also [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=221.98s)]
*  say that a very large hotel was hit, which is very close to the seafront. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  The Ukrainians for their part saying that that hotel hasn't been in use for years and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=231.2s)]
*  so therefore was empty. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  The Russians have been saying that they believe there might have been military inside that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=237.44s)]
*  hotel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  But again, the Ukrainians are saying that they believe that what the Russians are doing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  is a symbolic strike as retaliation for the fact that the Ukrainians hit the Russian Black [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=244.48s)]
*  Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=249.88s)]
*  Nevertheless, the damage extensive there in Odessa, two people have so far been confirmed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=251.8s)]
*  killed by the Ukrainians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=258.12s)]
*  Becky. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=259.48s)]
*  I want to bring in Sina Militar Analyst, former commanding general for the US Army Europe, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=260.48s)]
*  Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=264.32s)]
*  General, thank you so much for being with us right now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  The news that an admiral, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet might have been killed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=268.72s)]
*  in that strike, and actually we have some video on that strike that I can show right [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=273.72s)]
*  here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=276.72s)]
*  What would that do to the Russian efforts in Crimea? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=277.72s)]
*  Good morning, John. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=281.24s)]
*  It's a pretty big deal. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=283.44s)]
*  What I'd suggest is it's not only the commander of the fleet, but the targeting process that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  the Ukrainians are using where you garner intelligence and then decide what targets [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  you're going to hit and then strike it is the important part of this because it wasn't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=294.0s)]
*  just the admiral killed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  It was the admiral killed inside of his Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol where [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  others were killed, as you just mentioned. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=305.88s)]
*  There were actually a great many of his staff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=309.08s)]
*  Ukraine estimates between 34 and 37 other naval officers were killed there, but this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=311.44s)]
*  is going to disrupt the operations within the Black Sea. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=317.44s)]
*  The other thing that's important is the fact that in order to hit this headquarters, the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=321.16s)]
*  Ukrainian forces also hit a telecommunications node within the Black Sea Fleet. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=325.72s)]
*  So that's the ability for the intelligence to pass to different ships from the headquarters [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=330.8s)]
*  as well as really just destroying the command and control infrastructure of a major element [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  of the Russian Navy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=343.02s)]
*  You have to be able to hit it and you have to know he's there when you are hitting it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=344.02s)]
*  to have that kind of success. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=349.22s)]
*  General, you're a tank guy, so it is with great pleasure that I get to ask you about [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=351.02s)]
*  this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=355.42s)]
*  Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky says that the first U.S. Abrams tanks have arrived now [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=356.86s)]
*  in country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  What is the difference that these tanks can make? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=363.7s)]
*  Well, they're in my view, John, and I say this with a little trepidation because I'm [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=367.54s)]
*  sure the Germans would debate me on this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=372.94s)]
*  It is the best tank in the world. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=375.3s)]
*  It has the capability of high speed, great deal of armor protection, tremendous fire [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  power from the 120 millimeter gun. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=383.42s)]
*  It has the ability to range very far. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=386.94s)]
*  It also has great crew protection. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  It can hit targets it aims at, at close to 3,000 meters plus, which is tremendously important. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=393.1s)]
*  But it also has machine guns, several machine guns on the vehicle that can engage troop [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=401.18s)]
*  targets. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  So what you're talking about is a very capable armored system. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=407.70000000000005s)]
*  It is tough to train on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  The Ukrainians have been doing that for the last several months as promised. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=413.06s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Austin said the Ukraine forces are going to get 31 of these tanks, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=417.5s)]
*  which is the equivalent of a Ukrainian armored battalion. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=422.38s)]
*  And it will contribute to the ground warfare, especially in the ongoing offensive that Ukraine [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  is conducting. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=433.29999999999995s)]
*  So 31 of them, what do you do with them? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=434.41999999999996s)]
*  And I have the map here up of sort of the counter offensive here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=437.58s)]
*  And you can see very small areas of yellow, which the Ukrainians have been able to take [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  back. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=445.34s)]
*  Do you throw these 31 tanks right to the front immediately? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=446.34s)]
*  Or because you have relatively limited capacity, do you be careful with them? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=450.42s)]
*  Well, I hesitate to answer that question, John. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=458.34s)]
*  I know what I would do with them. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=460.7s)]
*  I would wait for the counter offensive that's ongoing now in several different directions [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=462.42s)]
*  to show some strength and breakthrough operations. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=467.34s)]
*  Then you would use these tanks as part of a combined arms team of infantry and artillery [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=470.54s)]
*  and air defense and engineers to continue to assault to the key positions or the key [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoJ0TdcQUUU&t=476.26s)]
