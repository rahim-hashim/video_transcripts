# Russia expert: This is why growing militarization of Russia is significant
**CNN - World News:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4)
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has returned home after visiting the US and Canada [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=0.0s)]
*  to shore up support for the war against Russia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=7.0s)]
*  The President called his trip productive, saying he secured long-term aid from Canada, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=10.0s)]
*  including much-needed medical evacuation vehicles. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=15.0s)]
*  He also touted a new agreement between Ukraine and the US to produce new weapons together. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=19.0s)]
*  We have a historical decision by the US to jointly produce weapons and defence systems, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=26.0s)]
*  including air defence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=32.0s)]
*  This is something that was an absolute fantasy until recently. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=34.0s)]
*  But it will become a reality. We will make it a reality. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=37.0s)]
*  Some American conservatives have been leery about providing additional funds for Ukraine, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=41.0s)]
*  but the British Defence Secretary says the UK will continue to back Kiv in the event [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=47.0s)]
*  a new US President decides to pull support. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=52.0s)]
*  Ukraine says Russia has carried out overnight strikes on the Odessa region, wounding at least one person. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=56.0s)]
*  According to the military, Odessa's port infrastructure was hit, a house was damaged, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=63.0s)]
*  and what was described as a non-residential building caught fire. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=69.0s)]
*  It happened a day after Ukraine accused Russia of launching deadly strikes in the southern region of Kherson. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=73.0s)]
*  CNN's Fred Pleiken with details. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=80.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians are conducting the main thrust of their counteroffensive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=110.0s)]
*  The latest that we have from the Ukrainian side is they say that they've been able to break through [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=114.0s)]
*  a Russian defence line and are fortifying the gains that they've made there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=118.0s)]
*  There was also some shelling coming actually from Russia on the town of Kharkiv, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=122.0s)]
*  and several people were wounded there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=126.0s)]
*  In the east, where I am, the Ukrainians also saying that they have been able to make gains. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=128.0s)]
*  Of course, in the past couple of days, they have said that they were able to take back two key villages [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=133.0s)]
*  which also allowed them to take a key route under fire control. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=138.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians are saying they've been able to fortify those positions [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=142.0s)]
*  and want to move forward and gain further territory in this area. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=145.0s)]
*  Fred Pleiken, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=148.0s)]
*  Jill Doherty is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=151.0s)]
*  She's also a CNN contributor and former CNN Moscow bureau chief. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=156.0s)]
*  Always good to see you, Jill. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=160.0s)]
*  I want to start with Sergey Lavrov's comments at the UNGA, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=161.0s)]
*  saying that the US, NATO, the EU have supported a racist regime in Kiev [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=165.0s)]
*  and the West is an empire of lies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=171.0s)]
*  What did you make of the content and tone of his words? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=173.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I didn't find it very surprising, Michael. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=178.0s)]
*  I think the racist part is a slightly different word, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=181.0s)]
*  but it fits with the description that Russia always brings up of Ukraine [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=185.0s)]
*  and then Ukraine as an instrument for the West to attack Russia. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=190.0s)]
*  This is the narrative. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=195.0s)]
*  I think it's very typical, but I think what was interesting about this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=196.0s)]
*  and it's becoming a very important theme, another narrative, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=201.0s)]
*  is this idea that Russia is on the side of the developing world, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=205.0s)]
*  that the West is elite, the West looks down on the world. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=210.0s)]
*  These are some quotes from that speech. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=216.0s)]
*  This is a speech by Lavrov and essentially is trying to tell the world [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=219.0s)]
*  what to do and take advantage of it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=224.0s)]
*  And so Russia is going back to what I would call an old Soviet trope, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=226.0s)]
*  an old Soviet narrative, which is that Russia positioning itself [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=231.0s)]
*  as a supporter and the defender of former colonial countries [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=236.0s)]
*  under the thumb of the West. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=242.0s)]
*  Now, I mean, you know, if you follow that through logically, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=244.0s)]
*  I think sovereignty is very important for small countries. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=248.0s)]
*  And here we have Russia attacking a smaller country and violating its sovereignty. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=252.0s)]
*  But I do think that those narratives do have some, as we say, legs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=258.0s)]
*  They're believed by some in the developing world. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=264.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you what you make of the successes by Ukraine in Crimea. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=267.0s)]
*  I mean, the Sarki military airfield, Russian warships in Sevastopol damaged [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=273.0s)]
*  and now the Black Sea fleet headquarters also damaged. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=277.0s)]
*  What do those attacks suggest about the apparent vulnerability [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=281.0s)]
*  of some pretty important critical infrastructure in Crimea? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=285.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's really a good point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=290.0s)]
*  I think it does, number one, illustrate that the Ukrainians are going farther [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=293.0s)]
*  and farther into Russia, that they are hitting things that are not just symbolic [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=298.0s)]
*  or even hitting Moscow. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=303.0s)]
*  They're hitting the command and control and some ships controlled by Russia. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=305.0s)]
*  That, I think, is very significant. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=311.0s)]
*  And they are indicating, the Ukrainians, that they're going to do a lot more of this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=313.0s)]
*  I think Russia is very worried about it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah, you've obviously sort of our eyes and ears when it comes to a lot of what's going on in Russia. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=320.0s)]
*  Is the war impacting ordinary Russians now, hitting the economy? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=326.0s)]
*  There are statistics that suggest it is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=330.0s)]
*  What are you seeing and hearing in terms of the impact on the home front? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=332.0s)]
*  You know, in a way, it's hard to judge this because especially in the bigger cities [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=336.0s)]
*  where there is more coverage and more news and people on social media, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=342.0s)]
*  the government is trying to say nothing is happening, you know, it's not important, life goes on. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=347.0s)]
*  But I think if you look at the growing militarization of Russia [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=356.0s)]
*  and it's really significant right now, the economy, yes, is being hit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=360.0s)]
*  But also you have school kids dressing up in military uniforms running around with guns. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=365.0s)]
*  You have a dance troupe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=372.0s)]
*  There's video, a dance troupe using rifles as they dance. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=374.0s)]
*  And then denunciations of your neighbor for criticizing the war, not being able to even call the war a war. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=379.0s)]
*  So I think even though there is that attempt to downplay the significance of this, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=387.0s)]
*  it's creeping into every aspect of Russian life right now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=393.0s)]
*  Just quickly going back to Sergey Lavrov, I mean, he was really defiant. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=398.0s)]
*  He rejected Ukraine's peace plan. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=402.0s)]
*  Do you see any chance of a diplomatic end to this war given the intractable positions taken? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=405.0s)]
*  Oh, Michael, I don't think so at this point. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=411.0s)]
*  I just cannot see it because they are so far apart. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=415.0s)]
*  I mean, the Ukrainians, the peace plan by Zelenskyy envisions several things. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=419.0s)]
*  But one of them is Russian troops have to pull out and land that was taken by Russia has to be given back to Ukraine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=425.0s)]
*  The Russians were adamant that is not going to happen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=433.0s)]
*  So at this point, I think it's really the fight. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=436.0s)]
*  The fight. It's back to the war. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=439.0s)]
*  And Ukrainians trying to make as much of a dent into Russia and reclaim their land as they can. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=441.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Always great to get your analysis. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=448.0s)]
*  Jill Doherty, thank you so much. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=451.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=454.0s)]
*  Ethnic Armenians living in the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region have started arriving in Armenia. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=456.0s)]
*  The Armenian government says more than one thousand refugees have entered the country so far. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=462.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands more could follow after Azerbaijan reclaimed the Nagorno-Karabakh region this week. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=468.0s)]
*  The area is home to one hundred and twenty thousand ethnic Armenians who have rejected Azerbaijani rule. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=475.0s)]
*  Azerbaijan has said it will guarantee their rights, but experts have repeatedly warned of the risk of ethnic cleansing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=482.0s)]
*  The conflict between the two sides has raged off and on for decades. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=490.0s)]
*  The latest bout, Azerbaijan's short offensive, ended with Armenian fighters agreeing to surrender. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=495.0s)]
*  Russia, an ally of both countries, brokered the ceasefire. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=501.0s)]
*  Armenia's prime minister now says his country's interests weren't protected. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=505.0s)]
*  Azerbaijan's attacks on Armenia in the last years clearly show that the external security structures Armenia is a part of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=513.0s)]
*  Armenia's security is not affected from the perspective of Armenia's security and state interests. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=521.0s)]
*  Officials say at least two hundred people were killed, four hundred others wounded in Azerbaijan's military operation. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MDIMyRoX4&t=527.0s)]
