# Ukraine 'likely' behind strikes in Sudan, Ukrainian military source says
**CNN - World News:** [September 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY)
*  The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine may be spreading far beyond Ukraine's borders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=0.0s)]
*  An exclusive CNN investigation has uncovered compelling evidence that Ukrainian forces have [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=6.24s)]
*  struck Wagner-backed fighters inside Sudan. It comes as Russia tries to expand its influence [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=12.24s)]
*  in Africa following the death of the Wagner chief Evgeny Plikogyn. CNN's Nimr Elgaber reports from [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=19.36s)]
*  Neighbouring Chat. Nightfall in a war-torn neighbourhood in the Sudanese city of Omdurman. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=25.84s)]
*  You are watching a thermal imaging video depicting military forces equipped in high-tech gear, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=33.12s)]
*  far more sophisticated than the Sudanese have demonstrated to date. And here, a series of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=38.72s)]
*  high-precision daytime strikes raining down from the sky in and around the same city, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=45.04s)]
*  hitting targets backed by Russia's Wagner mercenary group in Sudan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=51.04s)]
*  A Ukrainian military source told CNN this is the work of a foreign military. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=55.92s)]
*  Pressed on whether they would say unequivocally that Kiev was behind the attacks, the source [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=60.4s)]
*  would only say that Ukrainian special services were likely responsible, which would constitute [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=64.88s)]
*  a dramatic expansion in Kiev's theatre of war against Moscow. Previous CNN investigations [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=70.4s)]
*  exposed that the Sudanese paramilitary rapid support forces, RSF, has been heavily backed by [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=77.68s)]
*  Wagner as they fight the Sudanese army in a war for dominance. CNN obtained a series of videos [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  of the operation showing 14 different strikes on RSF weapons and equipment believed to be provided [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  by Wagner. We pinpointed seven different locations of the drone strikes in Omdurman, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  an RSF stronghold that has become a focal point of the conflict, and we geolocated footage of the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  night raid to the same city by identifying the buildings seen here. The drone video obtained by [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=106.96s)]
*  CNN had already been edited, but clues remain as to the identity of those behind the attacks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Text on the monitor of the drone controller seen here is in Ukrainian. These commercially available [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=120.24s)]
*  drones are widely used by Ukrainian forces. They have a maximum video transmission range of around [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=126.96s)]
*  nine miles. That means we can tell that the pilots of the drones were in Sudan close by. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=134.72s)]
*  It's a common tactic in Ukraine, but not so much in Sudan. Drone experts consulted by CNN said this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=140.96s)]
*  is the first time drones like this have been deployed in this fashion in Africa. CNN shared [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=147.12s)]
*  the videos with a high-level source in Sudan's army for comment, who said they had no knowledge [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=152.72s)]
*  of a Ukrainian operation in Sudan and did not believe it was true. Sudan became embroiled in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=157.12s)]
*  Russia's war against Ukraine last year, despite being thousands of miles from the front line. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=164.0s)]
*  When, as we reported, Wagner exploited Sudan's gold resources to help finance Moscow's Ukraine [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=170.96s)]
*  war effort, circumventing U.S. sanctions on Russia. After a plane carrying Wagner leader, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=177.2s)]
*  Yevgeny Prokoshin, plummeted to the ground late last month. Many believe that Wagner's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=183.04s)]
*  influence would recede, but just the opposite has happened. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=187.52s)]
*  Military whistleblowers in a number of African countries have told CNN that the Kremlin [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  is consolidating its power over Wagner's networks in the Central African Republic, in Sudan, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=197.52s)]
*  in Libya and in Mali. And now that network has expanded further, this time into Chad. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=203.44s)]
*  Chad has really been impacted by the fighting in neighboring Sudan, and yet it's emerging as a key [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  transit point for supplies to the rapid support forces in Sudan, part of an expansion of Russia's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=217.28s)]
*  influence in Africa. Cross-referencing testimony from intelligence and military sources active in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=225.44s)]
*  the region with satellite imagery, CNN has uncovered evidence that Wagner arms crossed through Chad [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=230.8s)]
*  within the last two weeks to get to an RSF military base in Sudan. If you look closely, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=236.32s)]
*  you can see over 100 vehicles, including scores of trucks at the base. Proof the supplies provided [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=242.4s)]
*  by Russia, Wagner continue. A strike on Wagner-backed forces in Sudan would constitute a blow [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=248.72s)]
*  to Moscow. If it is Ukraine, they will have raised the stakes for those willing to accept Wagner's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=256.4s)]
*  backing in the future, a lesson illustrating the price they could be forced to pay for cooperating [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=262.32s)]
*  with Russia. Naamal Bahr, CNN, and Jemana Chad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M5iq5x29mY&t=268.48s)]
