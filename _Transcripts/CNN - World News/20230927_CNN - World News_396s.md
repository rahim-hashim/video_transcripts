**CNN - World News:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE)
*  Another major headline we're tracking today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=0.0s)]
*  the US Army private who ran into one of [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=1.96s)]
*  the most repressive nations on Earth [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=4.84s)]
*  on purpose is now back in US custody. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=6.84s)]
*  More than two months ago, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=10.0s)]
*  Travis King raced across the DMZ, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=11.6s)]
*  the demilitarized zone, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=13.52s)]
*  while on a public tour of the joint [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=14.56s)]
*  security area that separates [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=17.12s)]
*  North and South Korea. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=18.64s)]
*  Now this is a picture of King on that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=20.0s)]
*  tour before making a run for it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=22.68s)]
*  You see the back of his head there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=25.04s)]
*  Of course, this is a rare move. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=27.0s)]
*  This release considering North Korea's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=29.36s)]
*  brutal record on human rights. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=30.96s)]
*  Let's take you now to the State [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=32.6s)]
*  Department and CNN Chief National [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=34.6s)]
*  Security correspondent Alex Markhorn. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=36.48s)]
*  So Alex, do we know exactly how [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=38.08s)]
*  this went down his release? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=40.56s)]
*  Well, Boris, I think you hit [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=44.6s)]
*  the nail on the head. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=45.64s)]
*  It is a rare move. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=46.68s)]
*  It is something that we're still [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  trying to understand North Korea [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=49.56s)]
*  saying today that they were expelling [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  private King that he had confessed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=53.32s)]
*  to crossing the border illegally. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Why exactly North Korea decided to do [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  this today is still unclear. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=60.92s)]
*  What we do know now from senior [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=62.92s)]
*  Biden administration officials is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=65.24s)]
*  that earlier this month, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  North Korean officials told Swedish [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  officials that they were willing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=70.4s)]
*  to release private King. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=72.6s)]
*  Now, why Sweden? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=73.72s)]
*  Well, the U.S. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=74.92s)]
*  doesn't have an embassy in Pyongyang, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  so Sweden is what is known [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=77.32s)]
*  as a protected power. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=78.48s)]
*  They represent U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=80.48s)]
*  interests in Pyongyang. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=81.48s)]
*  And now this was the culmination. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=83.84s)]
*  This releases the culmination of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=86.44s)]
*  months of what Biden administration [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=88.72s)]
*  officials are calling intense diplomacy, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=90.44s)]
*  not just involving the U.S., [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  North Korea and Sweden, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  but other countries as well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Certainly China was involved [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=98.24s)]
*  because we know that private [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=99.8s)]
*  King left through China. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=101.0s)]
*  Now, over the course of the summer, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=102.56s)]
*  you know, he's been held since July 18th. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=104.08s)]
*  There were concerns that private [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=106.32s)]
*  King would be used for propaganda [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=107.52s)]
*  purposes. Those never really materialized. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=109.0s)]
*  There were concerns, of course, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=111.56s)]
*  about his health. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=112.56s)]
*  He has said, according to these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=114.16s)]
*  officials, to be in good health, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=115.36s)]
*  to be very happy, very eager [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  to get home to his family. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=119.16s)]
*  There are also major questions about [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=120.88s)]
*  what North Korea might have gotten [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=122.12s)]
*  in exchange. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=123.92s)]
*  Biden administration officials [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=125.44s)]
*  are insistent that there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=126.64s)]
*  were no concessions, that there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=128.56s)]
*  was no exchange here, that this is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=130.36s)]
*  North Korea releasing private King. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=132.16s)]
*  Now, private King was taken [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=135.28s)]
*  from North Korea to China. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=136.88s)]
*  From China, he flew to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=138.76s)]
*  South Korea to a military [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=140.68s)]
*  facility, and then he is set to fly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=142.96s)]
*  onwards home to the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=145.0s)]
*  Boris, we have heard from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=147.0s)]
*  King's mother. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=148.88s)]
*  She said that she will be forever [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=149.68s)]
*  grateful to the United States Army [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=151.28s)]
*  and all its interagency partners. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=153.36s)]
*  Now, when private King arrives back [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=156.56s)]
*  in the United States, he's going to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=158.08s)]
*  go to Texas. He's going to go to a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=159.12s)]
*  medical facility called [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=160.44s)]
*  Brooke Army Medical Center for both [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=162.08s)]
*  mental and physical evaluation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=164.68s)]
*  and treatment. Big question still, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=166.72s)]
*  Boris, about what will happen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=168.28s)]
*  in terms of disciplinary procedures, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=171.0s)]
*  because he had been he was being [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=173.4s)]
*  sent home back in July because of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  an assault that he carried out in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=178.16s)]
*  South Korea. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=179.6s)]
*  Those issues were told by U.S. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  officials will be addressed once [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=182.28s)]
*  private King is back up on his feet. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=184.24s)]
*  Boris, yeah, still many unanswered [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=186.4s)]
*  questions. Alex Markhor, thanks so [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=188.32s)]
*  much for the update. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=189.84s)]
*  Let's expand the conversation now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=191.04000000000002s)]

*  Josh Rogan. Josh, thanks so much [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=194.36s)]
*  for sharing part of your afternoon [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=196.0s)]
*  with us. So the U.S. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  is saying that King was released [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=199.16s)]
*  without any concessions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=201.52s)]
*  Does that ring true to you? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=203.8s)]
*  Well, to be sure, Boris, that's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  very unusual, especially in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  North Korean context. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=211.24s)]
*  Charles Robert Jenkins, an army [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=213.52s)]
*  soldier who defected in 1965, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=215.84s)]
*  was held for 39 years and used [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  for propaganda, forced to marry a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=220.44s)]
*  chap and his wife, have some kids [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=222.0s)]
*  before they eventually let him out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=224.12s)]
*  Otto Warmbier, American college [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  student, was taken hostage in 2018, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=227.88s)]
*  returned 18 months later on a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=230.84s)]
*  stretcher in a coma and he died [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  six days later. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=234.4s)]
*  So private King is very lucky [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=235.4s)]
*  man. He did a very foolish thing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  by running across that border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=239.4s)]
*  And it's true, as Alex said, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=240.84s)]
*  that it took extensive [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  machinations by the U.S. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  government, the Swedish [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  government and the Chinese [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=247.52s)]

*  North Korean government, to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=249.52s)]
*  orchestrate this release over the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=250.84s)]
*  last couple of weeks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=252.8s)]
*  And according to administration [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  officials, he's in good health and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  good spirits. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=256.76s)]
*  They say he's very happy to be on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  his way home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=259.16s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=260.56s)]
*  Well, after things settle down, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=261.4s)]
*  he could face a court martial [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=263.48s)]
*  because that's usually how the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=264.68s)]
*  army handles desert. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=268.0s)]
*  machinations by China and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=269.08s)]
*  South Korea, Sweden included [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=271.52s)]
*  in there as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=273.48s)]
*  What kind of deal making goes [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=274.64s)]
*  on in a situation like this? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=276.68s)]
*  Because I'm still in a bit of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=278.32s)]
*  disbelief that they would let him [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=280.2s)]
*  go, given their history, in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=281.8s)]
*  exchange for seemingly nothing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=283.36s)]
*  Right. Well, most of the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=287.16s)]
*  negotiations were logistics, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=288.16s)]
*  according to administration [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=290.32s)]
*  officials, Swedish officials had [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=291.32s)]
*  to fly into North Korea and then [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=292.96s)]
*  they had to accompany him all the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=295.08s)]
*  way to the North Korea China [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=296.56s)]
*  border. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=298.12s)]
*  The U.S. embassy had to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=298.76s)]
*  coordinate with the Chinese [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=299.92s)]
*  government to pick him up on the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=300.88s)]
*  Chinese side of that border and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=302.4s)]
*  then get him out of China. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=303.48s)]
*  And so all of that is a huge [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=304.88s)]
*  logistical operation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=306.52s)]
*  As for what the North Korea, why [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=308.12s)]
*  did the North Koreans let him go? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=309.4s)]
*  I think that's the sixty five [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=310.68s)]
*  thousand dollars, sixty four [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  thousand dollar question, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=313.68s)]
*  something that private King may [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=314.92s)]
*  have some insight into once he [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=316.36s)]
*  gets stateside. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=318.2s)]
*  But suffice to say, they didn't [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=319.64s)]
*  see the value of holding him [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  greater than the value of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  releasing him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=325.64s)]
*  And it shows that they don't want [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=326.36s)]
*  to deal with the United States. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=328.12s)]
*  The Kim regime is pointing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  towards China. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=331.2s)]
*  They're dealing with Putin. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  They don't want to talk to us, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=333.4s)]
*  even to get something out of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=334.4s)]
*  releasing an American hostage. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  That's not a good sign at all. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So ultimately, what does [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=339.88s)]
*  it mean for U.S.-North Korea [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=341.56s)]
*  relations if they don't want to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  even have a conversation? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=344.64s)]
*  Not much you can do except leave [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  the door open for them and hope [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=349.16s)]
*  they come back to the table. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I've argued in The [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  Washington Post that we should [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=353.44s)]
*  put some more humanitarian and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  economic support on the table [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  for the North Koreans, try to, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=357.68s)]
*  you know, get in between them [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  and the Russians and the Chinese. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  But the Biden administration [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=361.68s)]
*  doesn't seem interested in that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  We can see this as a sort [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  of moment of cooperation, but [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  it doesn't portend or [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  or indicate that there's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  going to be any real progress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=374.36s)]
*  I think all the signs, other [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  signs coming out of North Korea [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=377.48s)]
*  state that they're going to get worse. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=378.6s)]
*  They're going to build more missiles [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=380.16s)]
*  and more nuclear weapons and become [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=381.24s)]
*  closer to our adversaries. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=382.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think that's the bigger problem [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  that the U.S. government will have [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=386.68s)]
*  to deal with one way or the other [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  after they get a private kid home. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=390.16s)]
*  Josh Rogan, always great to get [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=393.16s)]
*  your perspective, my friend. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xxjvu19LE&t=394.48s)]
