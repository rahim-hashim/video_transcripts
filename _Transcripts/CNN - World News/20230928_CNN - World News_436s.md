# Russia shows new video of top admiral who Ukraine claimed was killed
**CNN - World News:** [September 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU)
*  time. Russia is going out of its way to prove the commander of its Black Sea fleet is alive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=0.0s)]
*  and well. Ukraine claimed Admiral Victor Sokolov was killed in a strike on the fleet's headquarters [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=5.34s)]
*  on Friday. But as Fred Pleiken reports, Russia has released a second video in as many days, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=11.26s)]
*  reportedly showing the Admiral back on the job. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=16.42s)]
*  Nearly a week after Ukraine claimed to have killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=24.3s)]
*  fleet with a cruise missile attack, now another sign he may very well be alive after all. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=28.48s)]
*  Russian military TV showing Admiral Victor Sokolov handing out medals to a Navy soccer [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=35.0s)]
*  team, although CNN is unable to verify when the video was filmed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=40.32s)]
*  The award ceremony had to be postponed for known reasons. A reporter asked Sokolov to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=46.56s)]
*  comment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=50.6s)]
*  No, it's postponed just because we were busy and had to push it back a few days, he answers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=52.6s)]
*  Asked to reassure local residents after the missile strike, the Admiral in denial. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=59.28s)]
*  Nothing happened, he says. Life goes on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=66.04s)]
*  The new clip comes just a day after the Russians released a video apparently showing Sokolov [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=69.04s)]
*  attending a top-level video conference call with the Russian defense minister, seemingly [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=73.84s)]
*  propped up by a pillow. Russia still irate about the strike on the HQ, the Foreign Ministry [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=79.48s)]
*  spokeswoman claiming, without evidence, Western involvement in the attack. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  There is not the slightest doubt that the attack was pre-planned using Western intelligence [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=91.76s)]
*  assets, NATO satellite equipment, reconnaissance aircraft, and was carried out at the instigation [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  and in close coordination with the American and British intelligence services, she said. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=102.4s)]
*  What the U.S. and the U.K. maintain, their militaries are in no way involved in the war [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=108.36s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=113.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, some residents in occupied Crimea are questioning how committed Russia is to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=115.16s)]
*  their safety. After this video emerged, purporting to show mostly women and children prevented [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=120.6s)]
*  from entering a bomb shelter during an air raid alert a few days ago. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=126.4s)]
*  Why did you kick us out, a woman asks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=134.0s)]
*  I've been told the shelter is for employees only, the guard answers. All kids, all people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=135.88s)]
*  kicked out into the streets, she says. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=142.2s)]
*  Moscow trying to portray strength in the aftermath of the Black Sea Fleet HQ attack, Defense [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=146.4s)]
*  Minister Sergei Shoigu filmed visiting a missile factory that is allegedly increasing its output. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=151.72s)]
*  But even videos released by the Russian military itself, like this paratrooper unit, shows [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Moscow's forces struggling to hold the line against the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=165.12s)]
*  as Kiev says its forces are the ones that have the momentum. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=170.52s)]
*  For Pleitgen CNN, Eastern Ukraine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=175.12s)]
*  And for more analysis, we're joined by Mick Ryan, a retired general of the Australian [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=179.04s)]
*  Army and he's also the author of the book War Transformed and he's speaking with us [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=182.72s)]
*  from Kyiv. Thanks so much for being here with us. So I just want to start with what we saw [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=187.36s)]
*  there in Fred's package and the question of Ukrainian momentum after that attack on the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=191.88s)]
*  Black Sea Fleet headquarters. The reverberations still rumbling here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=196.32s)]
*  Yeah, g'day, it's good to be with you again. These attacks on the Black Sea headquarters, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=201.16s)]
*  Crimea and also in Moscow are part of a wider strategic strike campaign which the Ukrainians [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  use to complement their battlefield activities in the south and the east and to maintain [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  momentum whether it's on the battlefield or in the strategic sphere. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=218.84s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask you about another development. Ukraine saying former Wagner fighters are rejoining [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=221.84s)]
*  the battle. One Ukrainian military spokesperson said, quote, these individuals are indeed among [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=229.56s)]
*  the most well-trained in the Russian army, but they will not become a game changer. Are they right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=234.96s)]
*  No, I think the Ukrainians are right here. They are well-trained, but the Russians have [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=240.8s)]
*  other elite units, particularly the airborne forces that they're using in the south. So the Wagner troops, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=246.44s)]
*  I'm sure, will be a welcome addition to the Russian forces wherever they're employed, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=252.16s)]
*  but they are not going to be a game changer. They are certainly no silver bullet for the Russian army. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=257.12s)]
*  All right, so you're in Kyiv right now. I mean, this is, as I understand it, your third trip to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=262.12s)]
*  Ukraine this year. So I'd love to hear about what you're learning there. So I want to start with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=266.16s)]
*  this. You met with the Ukrainian ground forces head of training. What did they tell you? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=270.36s)]
*  Well, they've certainly learned a lot over the last 18 months about what you need to train a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  soldier for modern battlefield conditions, and that's changing constantly. So that connectivity [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  between the battlefield and preparing people for it is very important, but so too is the relationship [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=289.44s)]
*  with the number of NATO countries that are training Ukrainian soldiers on their soil. So, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=295.92s)]
*  you know, the big message is things are changing constantly, therefore how do we keep Ukraine [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=302.76s)]
*  up to adapt quickly as well? I spoke earlier of that railway line connecting some Russian-occupied [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=307.16s)]
*  cities with Russia, which will help their military logistics. I mean, in many ways, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  this is a war of procurement. Who can get their hands on the weapons and ammunition they need [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  and this is all in the context of dwindling supplies and a weathering of support for Ukrainian [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=324.96s)]
*  aid here in the US, at least politically. Ukraine's certainly facing headwinds on that front. What are [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=331.84s)]
*  they telling you? Well, it's certainly a war of industrial systems, and as we've seen with shortages [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=338.12s)]
*  of artillery, ammunition, and other bits of equipment, the world really wasn't prepared [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  for a large-scale war like this. I mean, some parts of the US industrial system are starting [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=349.88s)]
*  to expand productions, the Russians certainly are, but it's going to take some time for most [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=356.0s)]
*  countries to expand the production of munitions and equipment to meet the demands of this war. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=361.44s)]
*  Just on the railway construction, I mean, the Russian military have always traditionally used [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=367.08s)]
*  railways for a large part of their logistics, so this will have a very large military imperative [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=372.48s)]
*  for the Russian military to complete this railway line. And finally, with drones and technology [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=378.38s)]
*  playing an increasing part, I mean, you've been learning about Ukraine's digital transformation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=384.8s)]
*  What stood out to you there? Well, we've probably seen the most intense period of innovation and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=389.78s)]
*  adaptation when it comes to drones and autonomous systems over the last 18 months. It's unprecedented, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  just the quantity and quality of drones being used by both sides, but also how they're connected [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=404.1s)]
*  into the larger warfighting systems that both sides use, connecting them to artillery, to tanks, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  and to soldiers. I mean, there's a lot to learn here for every other army in NATO, and I'm sure [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=417.3s)]
*  they'll be watching what the Ukrainians and what the Russians are doing closely so we can evolve [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=422.1s)]
*  our own militaries. Yeah, absolutely. Listen, it's great to connect with you there in Kiev, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=427.38s)]
*  Major General Mick Ryan. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H35GdCASqbU&t=432.5s)]
