# Video shows Ukrainian 'vampire' drone take out Russian battle tank
**CNN - World News:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A)
*  The Russian Admiral, who Ukraine had claimed was killed in a strike on Crimea, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=0.0s)]
*  has now appeared in a video interview. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=4.32s)]
*  Viktor Sokolov says that the Black Sea Fleet that he commands [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=6.88s)]
*  is carrying out its tasks successfully. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=10.24s)]
*  He also refers to an award that was handed out in late August. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=12.76s)]
*  Now, CNN is unable to verify the date that this video was shot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=16.56s)]
*  On Tuesday, Ukraine's military certainly said [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  that it is now clarifying Sokolov's fate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  The Russian Admiral, who he had initially claimed he and 33 others [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  were killed in an attack Friday on Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=32.0s)]
*  in Sevastopol. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=37.2s)]
*  In the meantime, the Kremlin downplaying the arrival of the first [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=39.44s)]
*  US Abrams tanks in Ukraine, saying they will burn on the battlefield [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=42.6s)]
*  like other weapons. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=47.4s)]
*  But Ukraine's military has resources on hand, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=49.36s)]
*  including the menacing vampire attack drone. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  CNN's Fred Plykkin has what is this CNN exclusive report. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=55.4s)]
*  Rolling into battle as night falls, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=63.72s)]
*  Ukraine's army attacking in the east around Bakhut. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=65.84s)]
*  For the Ukrainians, this is an extremely important, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=70.52s)]
*  but also very complicated and potentially very dangerous mission, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=73.2s)]
*  and we're going to be located very close to where the Russians are. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=76.64s)]
*  We're with a frontline drone unit called Code 9.2. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=81.04s)]
*  Their drone, the Ukraine-made Vampire, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=85.72s)]
*  the crew attaching the bombs as artillery whistles over our heads. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=89.0s)]
*  The Vampire is fully night vision capable [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=94.0s)]
*  and plays a soundtrack showing it means business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=96.76s)]
*  BEEPING [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  The team leader's call sign is in the background. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  The team leader's call sign is Groove, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=108.56s)]
*  and he confirms because Ukraine doesn't have a modern air force tonight, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=110.8s)]
*  they are the air force. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=115.52s)]
*  The drones see in the night like in daylight, he says. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=118.88s)]
*  We see the infantry, we hit the vehicles, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=121.56s)]
*  cannons, everything we need to destroy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Groove also says Russians from the Wagner private military company [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=127.16s)]
*  have returned to the battlefield around Bakhut. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=131.08s)]
*  Yes, there is Wagner here too. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=136.32s)]
*  They swiftly changed their commanders and have returned here, he says. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=138.08s)]
*  We're breaking through their line of defence and hitting them well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  As the drone takes off, the battle is already well underway. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=145.4s)]
*  The Ukrainians using Western extended-range artillery shells [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  and cluster munitions to attack Russian ground forces. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Groove is already busy targeting the Russians. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=158.96s)]
*  Oh, something's burning, he says. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  His unit also managing to take out a Russian main battle tank [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=167.72s)]
*  by dropping several bombs on it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=171.44s)]
*  The Ukrainian army now starting to push forward. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=177.8s)]
*  Our photojournalist Dan Hodge films powerful explosions [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=180.36s)]
*  as armoured vehicles advance in the moonlit night. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=185.92s)]
*  We're now hearing a lot of fire, a lot of outgoing fire, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=192.64s)]
*  a lot of incoming fire actually also as well as the Ukrainians [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=195.64s)]
*  are trying to move forward and they say they want to take a key road [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=198.32s)]
*  away from the Russians. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=202.0s)]
*  But the Russians are fighting back, firing flares to unmask [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=206.2s)]
*  the Ukrainians' advance and hit Kiev's forces. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=209.72s)]
*  Groove remains unfazed, hunting a Russian tactical vehicle [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  before destroying it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=219.72s)]
*  The Code 9.2 drone team often hunts Russian armour here, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=221.72s)]
*  recently even destroying a modern T-90 tank [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=225.68s)]
*  in a highly complex operation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  After more than a half-dozen missions, the drone returns a final time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=232.84s)]
*  But as we try to get away from the battlefield, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=238.88s)]
*  a tire bursts on our Humvee. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=240.88s)]
*  No time for a spare, we push on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=244.0s)]
*  We just need to get out of here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=247.2s)]
*  We push on. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=248.92s)]
*  We just witnessed an extremely tough battle between the Russians [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=250.92s)]
*  and the Ukrainians, both sides going at it for hours [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=253.92s)]
*  with very heavy weapons and the area where we were, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  shells landed close to there on various occasions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  Now we're heading back to base. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  Hobbled butt-rolling after a long night on one of Ukraine's most dangerous front lines. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  For Pleikin, CNN, Bakhmut, Ukraine. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINDwB4AJ3A&t=273.91999999999996s)]
