# How the recent migrant surge is affecting US, Mexico, and Central America
**CNN - World News:** [September 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ)
*  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is headed to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=4.4s)]
*  Thousands of migrants crossed into the U.S. near Eagle Pass in the past few days, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=5.4s)]
*  the city's mayor says they feel abandoned and are pleading for help. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=9.64s)]
*  Well, now Texas Governor, Republican Greg Abbott, says that he is sending additional [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=13.0s)]
*  buses to Eagle Pass and El Paso to assist border communities. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=17.02s)]
*  CNN's Rafael Romo is with us now this morning to discuss. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=21.04s)]
*  And really, Rafael, this goes beyond the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=24.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Victor. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=29.56s)]
*  This is more of a regional problem. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  And the problem goes beyond the migrants who have already made it to the U.S. southern [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=32.76s)]
*  border. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=37.12s)]
*  There may also be tens of thousands of others on their way north. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=38.12s)]
*  We reached out to the government of Panama, a Central American country that serves as [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=41.96s)]
*  transit point for many immigrants coming from South America and other parts of the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=45.9s)]
*  They told us that during the month of August, listen to this, Victor, nearly 82,000 migrants [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=50.44s)]
*  crossed through their territory. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=56.56s)]
*  So far this month, more than 55,000 had done the same. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=58.2s)]
*  This massive number of immigrants is causing problems not only across the U.S. southern [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  border, as we have previously reported, but also in Central America and Mexico. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=67.48s)]
*  Take a look at how these migrants are traveling through Mexico on cargo trains, using bedsheets [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=73.0s)]
*  as tents to protect themselves from the sun during the long trip north. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=79.0s)]
*  One of those migrants told CNN that as risky as it can be, they prefer traveling on the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=83.04s)]
*  cargo train because taking the bus can be way more expensive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=88.0s)]
*  They take too much money from us when we go by bus. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=92.28s)]
*  Drivers get 500 pesos per person. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=97.64s)]
*  And that's why we arrived in Mexico City without any money, because they get greedy, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  If they stay, it makes me sad. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  And if they leave, I get sad too, because I know that if they stay, their dream is cut [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  short. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=112.0s)]
*  And if they leave, it is also sad because we will never see them again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=113.0s)]
*  They are our brothers and sisters. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=116.72s)]
*  Traveling on the cargo trains may be cheaper, but the trip north can also be deadly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=119.7s)]
*  On Tuesday, Ferromex, Mexico's largest railroad operator, suspended service of several northbound [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=123.64s)]
*  train lines after reporting half a dozen injuries and deaths of migrants. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=129.4s)]
*  And just to put this new migrant crisis in perspective, nearly a quarter of a million [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=134.56s)]
*  through Panama in 2022, according to Panamanian officials, more than 389,000 have done the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=141.5s)]
*  same so far this year. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=148.5s)]
*  And we also have an update, Victor, on the situation at the Border Customs and Border [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=150.26s)]
*  Protection's Office of Field Operations just announced that it has resumed operations at [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=154.86s)]
*  the International Railway Crossing Bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=160.5s)]
*  So that's a new development that had been closed for a while. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=165.16s)]
*  They're reopening now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=168.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=169.3s)]
*  These numbers are massive. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=170.3s)]
*  Rafael Romo, thank you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=171.3s)]
*  Omar? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=172.3s)]
*  Well, let's talk about all of this with Andrew Sealy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=173.3s)]
*  He's president of the Migration Policy Institute who joins me now to discuss. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=176.78s)]
*  So Andrew, we saw some of the numbers, just the differences in the number of migrants [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  encountered this year so far versus last year. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  And when you look at the data from the Panamanian government, it shows the number of migrants [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=189.02s)]
*  making the crossing through the Darien Gap is on the rise. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  Why are we seeing that sudden increase? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=198.2s)]
*  You know, we were, you know, three years ago we were talking about this and during the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=203.88s)]
*  Trump administration it's primarily a Central American issue. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=207.0s)]
*  But the number of Central Americans has gone down a bit, it's somewhat stable. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  But what we're seeing is this huge number coming through the Darien. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=214.0s)]
*  A lot of these are Venezuelans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  The largest displaced group, there are about 7 million, 7.5 million Venezuelans who've [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  left their country in the last 10 years because of the economic and political collapse of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=223.8s)]
*  that country. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  But it's also folks from other, that's about three quarters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=230.12s)]
*  But the other quarter are folks from all over the world, from Ecuador, which is going through [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=233.28s)]
*  a spike in violence where organized crime is taking over, people coming from Asia and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  Africa. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=242.28s)]
*  And it's gotten easier to come through the Darien Gap. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=243.28s)]
*  It's still incredibly dangerous, but it is now possible to do and there's now smugglers [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=245.28s)]
*  who dedicate themselves to getting people through. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=250.84s)]
*  Folks have discovered they can do this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=253.36s)]
*  And of course, an increase further south coming through the Darien Gap and starting in South [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=255.36s)]
*  America through Central America translates to what we're seeing at the U.S.-Mexico border now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's part of why the Eagle Pass mayor says he, well, it's not part of why, but he says he [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=265.2s)]
*  hasn't heard from the Biden administration amid the migrant crossings. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=270.56s)]
*  But what can the government do to help border communities, especially when they're much [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=273.92s)]
*  smaller than cities like New York City, who have also said they're they're struggling with the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=278.64s)]
*  influx of migrants? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=282.36s)]
*  You know, it's really impressive what's happened in border communities. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=285.44s)]
*  My colleagues and I spent some time in a number of the border communities, actually, from [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=289.24s)]
*  California to Texas over the past few months. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=293.48s)]
*  And there's generally speaking a real ability to collaborate right now between the federal border [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=296.32s)]
*  authorities, the city governments and the nonprofit groups to allow people to move on quickly [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=302.0s)]
*  and not have to stay in border communities. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=306.88s)]
*  But when they get a big surge like happened in Eagle Pass last week, it just completely overpowers [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=308.72s)]
*  the system. And, you know, that may be the other sort of big story going on here, which is, you [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=313.44s)]
*  know, right now, the sheer numbers are overpowering the system. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=318.12s)]
*  You know, you see that in Eagle Pass last week. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=321.12s)]
*  But overall, you know, the U.S. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=323.16s)]
*  government returns maybe a thousand people a day to countries of origin or to Mexico. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=324.44s)]
*  All others, they have to figure out what to do with them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=331.68s)]
*  Either they have to keep them in custody or they have to let them go. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=333.68s)]
*  And now we're getting, you know, seven, eight, nine thousand people a day. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=338.4s)]
*  And that also means the U.S. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  government is overpowered. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=344.0s)]
*  The ability to do any sort of deterrence at the border is limited. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=345.56s)]
*  And people discover that and they know they have a pretty good shot of getting in. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, help us help us contextualize here, because you remember back in May we were [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=352.76s)]
*  covering as many people were the end of what was Title 42, the pandemic era restriction [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  that deterring migrants or at least stemming the flow of it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=365.44s)]
*  Yet when that went away, many thought that, OK, maybe this is a situation that's a little [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=370.36s)]
*  bit more tenable in the future. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=375.6s)]
*  What is the dynamic that may have stemmed from that fall that we are seeing now if we [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=377.8s)]
*  are seeing ripples from that dynamic? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=382.88s)]
*  I think we are seeing ripples. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=387.44s)]
*  I mean, it's it's we're back to where we were in terms of numbers. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=388.92s)]
*  We're not over it, but we're back to where we were. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=393.0s)]
*  What they're trying to do is three because it's a three part strategy, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=395.68s)]
*  They are trying to make it harder to cross between ports of entry. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=398.92s)]
*  There's now it's harder to apply for asylum, but it's turned out to be very difficult to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=401.64s)]
*  implement that because they do have to give people due process and see if they're they're [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=406.8s)]
*  still eligible for asylum or not. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=411.08s)]
*  And that's taking a long time and it limits the numbers they can return. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=413.0s)]
*  They're trying to open more legal pathways so people can come legally. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=416.72s)]
*  They've done some of that, but it takes a long time to be effective. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=419.8s)]
*  And they're trying to surge in return for having less asylum at the border, do more [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=423.6s)]
*  refugee resettlement within the region. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  But that's also hard to do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  And what we've seen in the meantime, they have a great strategy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=433.56s)]
*  I mean, they're moving towards it, but just the sheer numbers have gone up and people [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  have discovered that their chance of getting in is pretty good and they're willing to risk [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  it. People are coming from extreme circumstances and they they look at the odds and they say, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=443.64000000000004s)]
*  you know, I might get deported. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=448.56s)]
*  Some bad things can happen to me on the route, but I'm willing to try it because I think [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  if I get to the U.S. border, there's a good chance I'll get in. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=453.84s)]
*  Yeah. And I should say that when the pandemic era public health restrictions lifted from [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  Title 42, the new measures that were put in place were aimed at deterring some of the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoA5M4aQ5HQ&t=461.32s)]
