# American soldier freed by North Korea is back in US
**CNN - World News:** [September 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc)
*  All right, more now on our breaking news. The American soldier who went absent without [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=0.0s)]
*  leave by running into North Korea, he is back in the U.S. We received confirmation that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=5.36s)]
*  the flight carrying Travis King has indeed arrived in San Antonio, Texas, more than two [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=10.64s)]
*  months after his dash over the military demarcation line in the Korean demilitarized zone. Let's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=15.6s)]
*  get straight to CNN's Mark Stewart, who is live in Beijing. So Mark, take us through [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  where exactly he'll be heading next and what happens. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=27.64s)]
*  Right, Kim. In the hours and even the days ahead, Travis King is almost going to go through [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=33.32s)]
*  a checklist of different chores instituted by the United States military. First of all, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  the big focus is going to be on his health, his physical health and his emotional health. He [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=44.04s)]
*  certainly will get a physical exam from a physician from a group of individuals described by the state [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=49.08s)]
*  department as being talented and experienced in these matters. He also may be taken to a program [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=55.64s)]
*  that's operated by the Department of Defense to help people like Private King who have been held [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=61.96s)]
*  in captivity, who have been who have been in a very difficult set of circumstances and then need [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=69.0s)]
*  to assimilate and get used to life once again. It's a program the Department of Defense is well [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=74.44s)]
*  known for. Brittany Greiner was taken there when she was released from Russia. And then also, I [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=79.88s)]
*  think it is very safe to say that the United States military and other officials are going to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=84.6s)]
*  want to question him about his own personal experience in North Korea. What questions were [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=88.6s)]
*  asked? What did you ask of them? What were the conditions like? What did you share? This is all [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=93.96s)]
*  part of a procedure that the Department of Defense has gone through with other individuals over the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=101.08s)]
*  years and likely will put in place now that Private King is back on U.S. soil, Kim. Interesting. And [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=107.08s)]
*  the decision by North Korea to return him so quickly, I mean, it's unusual given some of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=114.04s)]
*  other precedents. Do we know what's behind this? Does it indicate sort of how they valued him? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=120.12s)]
*  Well, we've been hearing from a lot of analysts over the last 12 hours or so who have had different [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=128.36s)]
*  takes, some suggesting that because he was a low-ranking military official, he may not have been [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=133.4s)]
*  seen as of great value to the North Koreans as perhaps someone of a higher rank. It is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=138.68s)]
*  interesting, though, to hear the different explanations as to how this release took place. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  North Korea being very adamant that this was an expulsion that took place after and an investigation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=151.0s)]
*  Yet if we listen to the United States Department, the State Department is saying that this was an [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=157.08s)]
*  intense diplomatic effort. It involved, of course, the United States, but giving a lot of credit to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  the Swedish government, even the Chinese government for helping to facilitate this release from North [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=167.16s)]
*  Korea over a bridge into China and then being greeted by the United States ambassador. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  One thing which is very clear, though, is the United States has been very adamant that no [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=179.32s)]
*  concessions were taking place. But as far as some kind of lasting impact, that still needs to be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=183.48s)]
*  determined, Kim. Yeah, I guess we only have about 30 seconds left. But do you think this will have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=188.84s)]
*  an impact in terms of relations with North Korea, relations with China, as you said, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=192.92s)]
*  that they were involved in this? Well, let's talk about China where I am right now. I mean, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=197.55999999999997s)]
*  the United States and China have had very lukewarm relationship in recent times, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  yet we did see this act of assistance to make this transition take possible. So perhaps the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  State Department is doing that in a positive sense. As far as the United States and North Korea, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=215.56s)]
*  right now they had no formal diplomatic relations. There's no indication at this point [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  that we are going to see some kind of change, Kim. Interesting. All right. Again, the breaking [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  news. Travis King back on U.S. soil. Mark Stewart in Beijing, thank you so much for that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8hsfh5Hrc&t=228.76000000000002s)]
