# 'Most important terrain for this entire war': Retired general reacts to Crimea attack
**CNN - World News:** [September 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q)
*  of new developments this morning out of Ukraine, Ukraine claiming responsibility [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=0.0s)]
*  for a fiery attack on the headquarters of Russia's black black fleet, black [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=4.12s)]
*  sea fleet in Crimea. New video is coming in showing that plumes of smoke just [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=9.4s)]
*  coming out of the buildings in the aftermath of this strike. Russian state [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=14.26s)]
*  media says debris has been scattered hundreds of meters. Ukrainian officials [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=18.36s)]
*  are warning the Russian black sea fleet could be quote unquote sliced up like a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=23.2s)]
*  salami is how they're saying it. If they don't surrender the Navy headquarters, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=27.12s)]
*  these new attacks come as Ukraine is ramping up its counter offensive, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=32.4s)]
*  continuing to try to push on its counter offensive operations against [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=35.64s)]
*  Russian military bases. So far, one Russian soldier is reported as missing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  after this latest attack. CNN's Katie pole glazes tracking this from London [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  for us. Katie, what more are you picking up now? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=47.74s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, clearly we are now hearing that Ukraine is taking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=51.3s)]
*  responsibility and the language is quite astonishing. You mentioned cut up [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=54.72s)]
*  like a salami. Well, we'll hear this. They say as well that Russia has two [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=58.24s)]
*  options for the future of its black sea fleet voluntary or forced self [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=61.92s)]
*  liquidation. Now, this is quite strong language from the Ukrainians and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=66.56s)]
*  clearly it's coming off the back of some confidence here at a very successful [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=70.52s)]
*  major attack on this headquarters of the black sea naval fleet. And it isn't [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=74.16s)]
*  just the attack today. There was also an attack yesterday at the Saki military [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=78.44s)]
*  air base, also in Crimea, and there was also an attack last week also in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=82.48s)]
*  Sevastopol at a ship repair facility. All of this is key infrastructure for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=86.44s)]
*  Russia's war in Ukraine. And surely this naval sea fleet headquarters is the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=91.12s)]
*  biggest infrastructure head of all really. And if you look at what's been [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  happening in the Crimea in the past few weeks, this is clearly part of Ukraine's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  strategy that they are targeting areas that they believe are not only crucial [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=102.96s)]
*  for Russia's war effort, but also notably Russia has held since 2014. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=106.92s)]
*  These are areas that have long been annexed illegally annexed by Russia from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and Ukraine's leadership have been very insistent that they intend to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  take it back. And clearly this has been quite a damaging attack. As you can see [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=118.92s)]
*  from those videos, there's a lot still unfolding. Very good point. And you're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=122.84s)]
*  all on top of course. Thank you so much, Katie John. And look, there's also just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=126.88s)]
*  huge symbolic value for Sevastopol here on the tip of the Crimean Peninsula [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=130.88s)]
*  from where the Russians host their black sea fleet to try to control the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=136.08s)]
*  whole black sea. This was a city of poor founded by Catherine the Great. This [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=139.2s)]
*  was the location of the Crimean War in the 18 50s. It held out against the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=143.22s)]
*  Nazis as long as it couldn't World War two. And then the Russians actually [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=148.1s)]
*  leased it back from Ukraine after the Cold War in 1991. This place again, huge [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  symbolic value to Russia with this. Now is Ben Hodges, retired lieutenant [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=156.44s)]
*  general and former commander of U. S. Army forces in Europe. General, thank [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  you so much for being with us. I mentioned the symbolic value. Talk to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=164.28s)]
*  me about the strategic value for Ukraine to continue to strike this port [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=167.56s)]
*  hard. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  John, Crimea is the most important terrain for this entire war. It's what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=175.06s)]
*  we would call the decisive terrain. Ukraine knows they'll never be safer, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=180.36s)]
*  secure as long as Russia is able to operate from there. Russia does not [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=184.46s)]
*  care about Donbass, except that that's where the land bridge is to Crimea. So [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=189.0s)]
*  if the Ukrainians are able to liberate Crimea, then this war actually, I think, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=193.88s)]
*  will be over. So what's happening? What your team has been describing very [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=198.8s)]
*  well, this is part of the counter offensive. The counter offensive is much [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=203.4s)]
*  more than the land operation. It's also the air and sea and special forces. All [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=207.84s)]
*  these things that are happening. This is the plan that designed by the Ukrainian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=212.84s)]
*  General Staff that is putting enormous pressure on the Russian General Staff. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=217.72s)]
*  And so asked the commander of the Black Sea Fleet how the counter offensive is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  going, he would tell you it's going terrible from a Russian perspective. Give [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  people another view of what's going on. Here's a vastable is down here on the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=231.24s)]
*  tip of the Crimean Peninsula. The land part of the counter offensive is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=234.52s)]
*  largely up here with Ukrainian forces trying to push inward on Russian lines [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=238.8s)]
*  here. And we have one other view of people. General, I want to show here of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  this. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Ukrainians were able [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=248.6s)]
*  to get armor through right here in this region to break through some of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=253.4s)]
*  Russian lines. And the map I'm showing the audience from the Institute of the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=258.94s)]
*  Study of War shows just how deep these Russian lines are. So if the Ukrainians [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=261.64s)]
*  have been able to get the first armored vehicles through some of these lines, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=268.14s)]
*  what's the significance? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=271.72s)]
*  So the way that Ukrainians will eventually liberate Crimea is by first [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=273.44s)]
*  isolating it and then making it untenable. So the ground part of the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=280.0s)]
*  counter offensive is aimed at just that, to isolate it by cutting the land [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  bridge. That means either by physically sitting on top of it, which is going to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=289.48s)]
*  be much more difficult, or with the penetrations that you're talking about, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=293.76s)]
*  they will soon be able to bring up longer range rocket launchers and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=298.04s)]
*  artillery that could disrupt any traffic moving down the land bridge. So [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=301.68s)]
*  the land part of this is a critical part of isolating Crimea. Meanwhile, all [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=306.64s)]
*  of these strikes against Sevastopol and Sakhi and Zhankoy, this is all part of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=312.96s)]
*  making it untenable so that the Russians can no longer operate from there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=318.12s)]
*  I gotta let you go very quickly. But what in the AIDS package that Ukrainians [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=323.08s)]
*  are asking for? What weapons do they want in order to try to pressure the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=328.08s)]
*  Crimean Peninsula? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=332.64s)]
*  Of course, what they need is the attack. I'm still a long range precision [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=335.08s)]
*  strike capability that would be hitting Sevastopol and Sakhi and Zhankoy every [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=338.4s)]
*  day. A great package by the U. S. U. S. Continues to do a lot. The dual [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=343.84s)]
*  purpose improve conventional munitions. The cluster munitions very effective [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=348.52s)]
*  for the artillery, but we still have not given the attack. I'm which would be [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=353.24s)]
*  the key. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. Great to have you on. Thank you so much. Before [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=358.2s)]
*  heading to Canada for let him is Linsky was in Washington, appealing for more [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  aid. The Ukraine's wartime leader wasn't feeling the love from everyone [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=366.12s)]
*  this time around on Capitol Hill. Instead, some skeptical congressional [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=370.32s)]
*  Republicans questioned the future of U. S. Support. At the same time, Mr [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=375.0s)]
*  Zelensky secured another aid package from the Biden administration. But [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=380.08s)]
*  there are lingering questions about possible Ukraine fatigue. CNN's White [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=384.12s)]
*  House correspondent Jeremy Diamond joins us with more on all of this. Good [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=389.48s)]
*  to have you with us, Jeremy. So cold frosty getting the cold shoulder with [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=393.36s)]
*  some of the ways that this reception that Mr Zelensky got was was described [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=398.0s)]
*  with the headlines from this visit in the U. S., which was such a contrast to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=405.0s)]
*  the huge standing ovation he got last time around when he visited last year. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=409.96s)]
*  No doubt about it. Last time President Zelensky was here nine months ago, he [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  received essentially a hero's welcome in Washington. He was offered a joint [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=419.44s)]
*  session of Congress to address a joint session of Congress in a prime time [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=424.68s)]
*  address by the speaker of the House at the time, Nancy Pelosi. But nine months [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  later, he faced a much frostier reception, at least from the current [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=432.97999999999996s)]
*  House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who did meet behind closed doors with Zelensky, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=437.2s)]
*  but did not, it seems, want to be seen in public with the Ukrainian leader. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=441.64s)]
*  And that's because that's a reflection of waning support for Ukraine within the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=446.36s)]
*  Republican Party among its rank and file among its base voters, but also among [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=451.8s)]
*  some of those elected members of the House. As President Zelensky arrived, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=457.48s)]
*  23 House Republicans and six Republican senators issued a letter rejecting the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=461.68s)]
*  Biden administration's latest request for 24 billion dollars of additional aid [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=467.96s)]
*  for Ukraine. They are questioning essentially the open ended commitment to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=472.16s)]
*  this war and asking questions about Ukraine's strategy as it has made this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=476.04s)]
*  kind of halting progress in its counteroffensive against Russia. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=480.08s)]
*  And so that those numbers of Republicans, that's certainly not a majority of the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  Republican caucus. It seems fair to say that a majority of Republicans in Congress [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=488.72s)]
*  still do support aid for Ukraine. But the problem is Kevin McCarthy has a very [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=493.0s)]
*  narrow majority in the House. And in order to retain his speakership, he needs to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=498.08s)]
*  retain the support of those members. And so far, he hasn't committed to bringing up [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=502.48s)]
*  that package for a vote. Of course, all of this is tied up in these broader spending [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=506.4s)]
*  negotiations as lawmakers race to avert a government shutdown in just over a week. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=510.52s)]
*  So there's a lot of complicating factors. But one thing that President Zelensky and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=516.12s)]
*  President Biden very much tried to use yesterday's visit as an opportunity to do [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  was to try and make the case to the American public for why supporting Ukraine [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=524.32s)]
*  is so important, not only for that country, but also for the world at large and for the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  precedent that it could set if Russia is allowed to roll over and essentially grab [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=533.64s)]
*  all of this territory in Ukraine. And so President Biden was able to make that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=538.72s)]
*  statement of continued support for the Ukrainian people. He expressed optimism that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=543.12s)]
*  Congress will continue to approve additional funding for Ukraine. Why? He said [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  because there is simply no alternative to that. And he was able to express that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=552.12s)]
*  support, of course, as you mentioned, with that additional three hundred twenty five [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  million dollars in additional assistance for Ukraine. The question is, will he be [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  able to get that twenty four billion dollar package through? And if so, when? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=564.32s)]
*  And so, Jeremy, just break down for us what's included in that three hundred and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=569.2s)]
*  twenty five million dollar package and what's missing? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, it has a significant air defense capabilities, anti-armor [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=578.0s)]
*  munitions, as well as those cluster munitions, the controversial munitions, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=583.2s)]
*  which President Biden approved for the first time to send to Ukraine earlier [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=588.24s)]
*  this past summer. What it does not include, though, is the attack system, that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=593.48s)]
*  long range missile system, which President Zelensky, as recently as a few days ago, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=598.2800000000001s)]
*  was pleading with the United States to provide. The National Security Adviser, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=603.24s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, said that President Biden ultimately decided not to provide that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  system at this time after conducting an assessment of Ukraine's battlefield needs [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=611.32s)]
*  and also weighing that against the U.S.'s own defense arsenal needs. But to be [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=615.36s)]
*  clear, he said that it's not off the table entirely, and it is certainly possible [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=620.36s)]
*  that that system, which Ukraine has been asking for for some time now, could [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=625.08s)]
*  eventually be provided. We have seen, of course, time and again, the United States [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=628.2s)]
*  deny Ukraine's request for step up weaponry. Look at fighter jets, look at [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=632.16s)]
*  tanks, look at various long range artillery systems saying no and then [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=637.08s)]
*  ultimately reversing that decision and saying yes at a later date when they feel [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=642.0s)]
*  it's more appropriate for the conditions on the battlefield. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=646.16s)]
*  All right, Jeremy Diamond with a very comprehensive update from the White [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=649.48s)]
*  House. Thank you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESzz3PtR29Q&t=652.88s)]
