# Russia sends message in new video of Putin and warlord
**CNN - World News:** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA)
*  Tonight, new video into out front, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=0.0s)]
*  showing a fierce battle unfolding [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=2.0s)]
*  on the eastern front of Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=3.5s)]
*  And this is the moment a Ukrainian soldier spots two [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=5.5s)]
*  Russians that are running just feet away from him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=8.2s)]
*  Then he opens fire. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=11.38s)]
*  And this new video that we are seeing today [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=13.18s)]
*  comes as Vladimir Putin appeared earlier with a top ally, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=16.72s)]
*  the Chechen warlord Romsan Kadriov. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=20.06s)]
*  Amidst speculation, the Kadriov's health was deteriorating. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=22.12s)]
*  Now, Ukraine claimed the Kadriov was gravely ill [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=25.62s)]
*  from kidney failure. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=28.02s)]
*  Unsubstantiated reports suggested he'd been poisoned [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=29.96s)]
*  or even died. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=32.56s)]
*  But tonight, the Kremlin wants you to know that Kadriov, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=34.2s)]
*  the warlord who some experts say is a father-son [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=36.2s)]
*  like relationship with Putin, and of course, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=38.34s)]
*  many say has been instrumental in the war, is alive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=40.3s)]
*  Matthew Chance is out front. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=44.44s)]
*  Behind the daily strikes, an information war is raging, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  fueling speculation about key Russian figures, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  forcing the Kremlin to dispel the rumors. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  Like those swirling around hardline Chechen leader, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=60.18s)]
*  Romsan Kadriov, now shown on state TV, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=63.62s)]
*  meeting President Putin after rumors he's gravely ill. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=66.92s)]
*  Rumors spread by Ukrainian intelligence [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  and that Kadriov has denied on social media. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=73.96s)]
*  I strongly advise all those who can't tell the difference [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=77.42s)]
*  between truth and lies on the internet [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=80.72s)]
*  to go for a walk in the fresh air [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=83.24s)]
*  and put their thoughts in order, he wrote. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=85.52s)]
*  In recent weeks, Russia has been busy denying Ukrainian claims [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=91.46s)]
*  that a strike on its Black Sea fleet headquarters [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=96.24s)]
*  in Sevastopol killed dozens of Russian naval officers, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=99.1s)]
*  including the overall commander. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=103.4s)]
*  Admiral Victor Sokolov soon appeared [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=105.78s)]
*  in an undated video call with Russian defense officials. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=108.78s)]
*  His stiff appearance, though, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=113.0s)]
*  only fueled speculation about his condition. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=114.64s)]
*  Finally, the admiral is shown handing out medals [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=117.88s)]
*  to the Russian Navy soccer team, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  answering questions apparently on the attack, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=123.58s)]
*  although CNN can't verify when the event took place. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=126.68s)]
*  Could you please tell us in a few words [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=132.36s)]
*  what happened to Rear Shore Sevastopol residents? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Nothing happened to us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=138.0s)]
*  Life goes on. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=139.86s)]
*  The Black Sea fleet is carrying out the tasks [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  assigned to it by the command. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=143.96s)]
*  But prominent Russians do have a tendency [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  to occasionally drop from view. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=149.62s)]
*  General Sergei Surovikin, a senior Russian commander [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=152.5s)]
*  linked with Wagner, disappeared after recording a statement [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=155.84s)]
*  calling for the mercenary group [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=159.9s)]
*  to abandon its rebellion back in June. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=161.9s)]
*  Months later, in September, this image was circulated, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  purporting to show Surovikin and his wife [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=169.24s)]
*  out and about in Moscow in a bid to dispel rumors [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=171.94s)]
*  of his arrest. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=175.94s)]
*  And even Russia's defense minister, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=177.22s)]
*  shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=179.42s)]
*  vanished from view for over a week, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=183.74s)]
*  eventually popping back up on a video conference call [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=186.78s)]
*  with Putin, a sign perhaps he was back in favor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=189.66s)]
*  And, Erin, the Kremlin will criticize the reports [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=195.24s)]
*  that come out from Ukraine, from the West, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  about where people are and what's happened to them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  But the truth is, it's such an opaque country now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=204.28s)]
*  Even Russians don't know what's really going on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=207.96s)]
*  So the whole country is rife [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=210.84s)]
*  with exactly that kind of speculation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=212.36s)]
*  Rife, I mean, even pergosian, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=215.08s)]
*  Then there was, was he alive, was he not? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Anything can fuel the conspiracy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=218.8s)]
*  He disappeared for a while, and then he emerged [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  when his plane crashed, of course. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=222.44s)]
*  All right, thank you very much, Matthew Chance. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=225.52s)]
*  And the big question tonight around Russia [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=227.64s)]
*  is whether the United States can transfer [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=230.44s)]
*  $300 billion in Russian assets to Ukraine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  All this frozen money, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=235.52s)]
*  Just give it to Ukraine. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=236.64s)]
*  Well, the renowned constitutional expert, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=237.8s)]
*  Lawrence Tribe, says yes, they can. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=239.32s)]
*  It is completely legal, and it must be done immediately. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=241.88s)]
*  Out front now is the Harvard Law School [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=245.56s)]
*  Professor, Lawrence Tribe. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=247.0s)]
*  And, Professor, I appreciate your time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=248.16s)]
*  So you've spent a lot of time thinking about this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=249.48s)]
*  And, you know, we've talked about this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=251.28s)]
*  at the beginning of the war, certainly, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=253.32s)]
*  The images of the yachts and frozen assets. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=254.92s)]
*  Right now, we understand there are about $300 billion [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=258.28s)]
*  in known frozen Russian assets sitting in international banks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=261.92s)]
*  So this is actual cash that you're referring to. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=265.56s)]
*  You say that it is legal to give that money to Ukraine, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=268.48s)]
*  and I believe now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=272.64s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=274.2s)]
*  Well, basically, the International Emergency Economic [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=276.08s)]
*  Powers Act that Congress enacted many years ago [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=281.12s)]
*  gave explicit power to the American president [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=285.76s)]
*  to seize and transfer, and the word used in the statute [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=289.44s)]
*  is transfer, frozen assets that have been frozen, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  pursuant to sanctions when the president declares [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=298.44s)]
*  a relevant international economic emergency, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=302.32s)]
*  and Biden has done that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=305.48s)]
*  So in my view, and I have studied it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=307.56s)]
*  with the help of brilliant lawyers [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  at the law firm of Kaplan, Hecker, and Fink [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=314.0s)]
*  at the request of the Renew Democracy Initiative, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=317.32s)]
*  the conclusion after six months of careful study [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  is that there is just no question about the president's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=324.56s)]
*  power in the United States to transfer the $35 billion [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=327.8s)]
*  or so that are frozen here rather than just letting [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=333.24s)]
*  that money stay idle. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=336.84s)]
*  And once that's happened, the other $300 billion [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=339.08s)]
*  frozen in other countries, from Canada [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=343.2s)]
*  to various countries in Europe, that can be released as well [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  and transferred to Ukraine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=350.36s)]
*  You showed in earlier video the devastation in Ukraine. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=352.8s)]
*  It's the result of an aggressive, illegal war, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  determined to be a war of genocide. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=362.76s)]
*  Putin himself is under the threat of arrest [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=366.64s)]
*  should he go anywhere outside of Russia, basically. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=371.64s)]
*  And for all of this money to simply sit there and do nothing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  while children are kidnapped and people are murdered [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=378.68s)]
*  and raped is an outrage. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=382.4s)]
*  That's why I think it should be done now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=384.96s)]
*  I do want to point out, by the way, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  when you talk about $335 billion, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  we know Swiss banks, a lot of other places. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=391.56s)]
*  I'm just pointing out as a matter of record, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=394.32s)]
*  there's a lot more money and a lot more that can be done [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  in terms of freezing assets. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a separate point from what you're making, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=400.44s)]
*  but I think one just worth making so people don't forget. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=402.08s)]
*  I do want to just give the side here [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=405.84s)]
*  that maybe this isn't a good idea, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  but some have put forth. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=411.92s)]
*  Bloomberg News editorial board this summer [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  said that a move that you suggest would, quote, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=416.36s)]
*  set a worrying legal precedent. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=419.16s)]
*  And they say, and I quote them, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  respect for state and private property is essential [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=422.68s)]
*  to modern economies and a functioning global trading system. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=425.44s)]
*  By confiscating Russian assets, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  the US and Europe would risk undermining that hard-won norm [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=429.88s)]
*  while giving other governments an incentive [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  to take punitive action against Western interests. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=434.8s)]
*  What do you think about that argument? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=438.92s)]
*  But it just invites sort of a payback and a back and forth [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=440.64s)]
*  that ends up in a really bad place for everyone. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=445.52s)]
*  No, international law makes clear [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=449.52s)]
*  that when there is an illegal war of aggression [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  that annexes a sovereign state, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  then countermeasures are entirely appropriate. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=457.68s)]
*  And if what this does is create incentives [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=462.36s)]
*  for other countries not to commit [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=466.08s)]
*  the kind of illegal aggression [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=468.12s)]
*  that Russia has committed, that's just fine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=469.64s)]
*  A lot of hard-headed people, Bob Zoellick, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=472.4s)]
*  the former president of the World Bank, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=474.64s)]
*  Lawrence Summer, the former secretary of the treasury, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  have looked into this with us [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=479.64s)]
*  and have concluded that there would not be [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=481.24s)]
*  a destabilizing effect. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=483.28s)]
*  There wouldn't be what some people call de-dollarization. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=485.12s)]
*  In fact, the incentives would all be entirely positive. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=489.24s)]
*  So all of the scare tactics [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  about how this would be destabilizing, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=495.36s)]
*  they're just not true. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=497.96s)]
*  What is destabilizing is to have a country [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  for the first time since World War II [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=502.56s)]
*  break the international agreements [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=505.16s)]
*  and simply invade a neighbor, a sovereign neighbor. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=507.32s)]
*  And it's not private property I'm advocating taking. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=511.88s)]
*  It's actually very complicated [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=515.0s)]
*  to take the private yachts of oligarchs. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  That's all tied up in litigation. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=520.08s)]
*  But a nation like Russia [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=522.16s)]
*  does not have private property rights. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=524.36s)]
*  It's a sovereign. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=527.08s)]
*  And because it's a sovereign nation, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=528.28s)]
*  it's a matter of international diplomacy, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=529.92s)]
*  not a matter of law. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=532.2s)]
*  That's why Canada, following the examples [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=533.76s)]
*  that we said in this report, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=537.0s)]
*  is considering not involving the courts and the seizures [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  so that the judicial obstacles to seizing these assets [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  will not be in the way. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=548.0s)]
*  You know, I've studied this for decades [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=549.72s)]
*  and I think the answer is clear. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=551.88s)]
*  The power of the executive branch [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  to engage in foreign policy along these lines [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=557.92s)]
*  in order to discourage illegal aggression [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  is very clear, both in the United States [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=565.52s)]
*  and in other G7 countries. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  All right, well, Professor Tribe, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=569.92s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=571.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfxwNy3TvPA&t=571.9599999999999s)]
