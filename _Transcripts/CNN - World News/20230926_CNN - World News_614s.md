# ‘Good news for everybody’ if Russian admiral is dead, says Ukraine’s defense minister
**CNN - World News:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM)
*  Minister Umarov, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you confirm that the head of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Viktor Sokolov, is in fact dead or alive? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=7.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, he is in our temporary occupied territory, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=12.4s)]
*  so he is not...he should not be there at all. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=17.0s)]
*  So if he is dead, it's a good news for everybody [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=20.2s)]
*  that we are continuing to de-occupy our territory. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=23.8s)]
*  Do you think you will get the... [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=27.4s)]
*  aren't they called actums, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  those long-range missiles from the United States? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=32.4s)]
*  We have...we have just had a successful visit to the United States, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=36.6s)]
*  so hopefully soon we will see the results. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=41.8s)]
*  Ha! I'm trying to understand from you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=45.8s)]
*  whether Ukraine is entering a new phase of not just depending [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=49.8s)]
*  on your friends for weapons and ammunition, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=55.2s)]
*  but are you planning, as I've read, a big, you know, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  build-up of your own in terms of manufacturing of ammunition, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=64.2s)]
*  weapon systems and the like? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=69.2s)]
*  I will just explain to you the logic behind. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  As Russia always alleges us as a failed state [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  and always alleges us in corruption, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=78.4s)]
*  we want to say to our partners that we are very transparent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=81.6s)]
*  and we are going to make the procurement, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  contract management, logistics very transparent, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=88.0s)]
*  and we're going to supply all these weapons [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=90.8s)]
*  imported to our countries by either... [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  by buying them directly or through the foreign military aid, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=99.0s)]
*  but we're also going to localize all the production. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=102.8s)]
*  I don't want to go into details, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=107.0s)]
*  but this is supply chain management risk assessment [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=109.0s)]
*  that we need to localize as much as we can [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=113.6s)]
*  so that we'll have sufficient facilities to have the weapons [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=116.2s)]
*  we need for the occupation of our territories. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=121.8s)]
*  You said once that everything, you know, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=125.0s)]
*  that can be produced locally must be produced locally. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=128.8s)]
*  My focus is that, of course, the Minister of Defense [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=133.4s)]
*  should be supplying its defense forces [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  with whatever they need to regain territory [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=139.6s)]
*  and to defend their people, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=143.4s)]
*  but at the same time, I have focused [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=145.0s)]
*  to what President Zelensky have said, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=148.4s)]
*  that we need to have the local production [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=150.8s)]
*  so that we could have more workforce [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=154.4s)]
*  and they would be focused on to the defense technologies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=158.6s)]
*  And after we win the war, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=162.2s)]
*  we would be one of the largest defense tech countries. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  So at this stage, my priority is to localize everything [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  that could be localized to have a local production [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  on anything that our forces need. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=178.0s)]
*  Can I ask you a little bit about strategy? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  A lot has been reported about your own, you know, your own origins. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=182.6s)]
*  You are Tatar from Crimea. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=187.2s)]
*  This is your homeland. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  And as you know, and as we've reported, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=192.0s)]
*  quite a lot of Ukrainian effort has gone into, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=194.6s)]
*  striking and targeting Russian facilities [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=199.0s)]
*  in occupied Crimea, annexed Crimea. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=201.8s)]
*  How important is that for you personally [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=205.0s)]
*  and for the counteroffensive? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=209.6s)]
*  I'm Ukrainian of Crimean Tatar origin. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=212.4s)]
*  And, of course, as a person who was born in exile, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=215.8s)]
*  in deportation and have felt the hardship myself [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=220.6s)]
*  being a refugee or internally displaced person, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=227.0s)]
*  of course, I feel heartbroken that for almost 10 years [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=231.0s)]
*  I'm away from my homeland. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=236.0s)]
*  So, and we have many people that are now living [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=238.0s)]
*  as internally displaced persons from the occupied territory. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=242.6s)]
*  So it is a personal, of course, focus for me [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=246.6s)]
*  to de-occupy all the territory so that our IDPs become [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=251.6s)]
*  not IDPs, but normal citizens so that we can live our own life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=257.4s)]
*  So as a Minister of Defense, of course, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=262.0s)]
*  I'm focused to our strategy of victory. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=263.8s)]
*  I'm focused to supply and call whatever needed to our soldiers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=268.2s)]
*  But at the same time, I will be feeling happy if I'll go back home. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=273.4s)]
*  Now, corruption. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=279.2s)]
*  There has been a lot of focus on that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=281.2s)]
*  And we have noticed that several of the deputies have been dismissed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=283.4s)]
*  Six out of seven deputy defense ministers have been dismissed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Is that about allegations of corruption? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=293.2s)]
*  You have said the whole defense ministry needs to be rebooted. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  So firstly, we continue our efforts for being very transparent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=303.0s)]
*  So we make the very clear assessment on acquisition and sustainment. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=307.6s)]
*  We're putting the system, very transparent procurement system, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=313.2s)]
*  a very transparent contract management system, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=318.2s)]
*  and we'll be probably consolidating and unifying all the defense forces' [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=321.0s)]
*  logistics systems. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=327.6s)]
*  So at this stage, rebooting needed for the new challenges that need to come. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=329.2s)]
*  The previous team worked when there was full-scale invasion [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=335.8s)]
*  and there was no system. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=340.2s)]
*  Many partners, many people have abandoned, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=342.8s)]
*  but then they regained confidence. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=348.0s)]
*  So at this stage, we need to bring the country to victory. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=351.2s)]
*  So there needs to be a new set of, let's say, targets that strategically [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=355.4s)]
*  we need to get to, and I'm here to make it happen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  Let me ask you about weapons that you have been given and weapon systems. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=370.0s)]
*  So it was announced on Monday that the first of the Abrams tanks have arrived, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=373.4s)]
*  the M1 Abrams tanks have arrived. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, I remember interviewing your predecessor, Minister Reznikov, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  in January when it was announced that they would be coming. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=385.2s)]
*  That's practically 10 months ago for all intents and purposes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=388.8s)]
*  That's a long time to wait for weapon systems in your current environment. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=393.2s)]
*  I mean, do you think that you're getting what you need when you need it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=399.0s)]
*  Well, there is always questions, but our focus is a victory. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=405.0s)]
*  And at this stage, we need more weapons to make the game change. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=412.2s)]
*  So at this stage, when Heimers arrived, we made a progress. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=419.4s)]
*  When tanks came, we made a progress. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=424.2s)]
*  And soon, hopefully, the jets will come and we will make progress. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=427.8s)]
*  That's why this war, this strategy of victory needs to be put as a priority. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=431.0s)]
*  And we need these weapons to regain the territories [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=438.0s)]
*  and have advantage on the battlefield. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=441.6s)]
*  Let me put to you what a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=444.20000000000005s)]
*  told me about essentially the game plan. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=449.20000000000005s)]
*  You traveled to meet the international partners, as you said. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=454.6s)]
*  At Ramstein, you went with President Zelensky to the UN. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=458.6s)]
*  This is what Kurt Volker told me during that time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=466.0s)]
*  Turning it to the U.S. side, I think there is a growing sense [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=467.8s)]
*  that we don't see an end in sight. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=471.2s)]
*  And you hear that from members of Congress. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=473.2s)]
*  How much is this going to cost? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=474.8s)]
*  How long is it going to go on? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=476.4s)]
*  So there's a frustration there. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=478.0s)]
*  Can you hear the frustration from the American side? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=480.0s)]
*  What is the game plan? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=483.0s)]
*  What is the end game? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=484.2s)]
*  And how long is this going to go on? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=486.0s)]
*  End game is that when we reach our internationally recognized borders, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=488.8s)]
*  we bring Russia to justice and regain our old territories. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=495.4s)]
*  So the focus should be winning Russia on our grounds [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=500.4s)]
*  and to make them accountable for all the damages and atrocities they've done. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  So we need to understand that the people should be helping Ukraine [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=512.6s)]
*  because it's for the national security reasons of their own countries, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=516.6s)]
*  because Russia will not stop. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=522.4s)]
*  It will go and go and go. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=523.8s)]
*  It has been all the centuries for the last 300 years. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=525.8s)]
*  It was expansion. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=529.4s)]
*  It was brutality. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=530.4s)]
*  It was killings. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=531.4s)]
*  So Ukraine is defending the values that people share, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=532.8s)]
*  the independence, the sovereignty, the human rights. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=537.4s)]
*  So we want our people to be happy and be a part of European Union and NATO. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=539.8s)]
*  So that's why we defend our own values. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=545.6s)]
*  President Zelenskyy have given the world class, I would say, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=549.0s)]
*  the example of resistance. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=556.0s)]
*  And it gives big hope to people, an example of courage, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=558.6s)]
*  an example of retaliation and resistance. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=564.6s)]
*  So these values are shared by most of our peoples [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=568.0s)]
*  and with most of our partners. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  So this war should end only with one conditions, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=578.6s)]
*  when we regain all of our territories [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  and we regain and free people. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=586.4s)]
*  Why? Because, as I said, Russia should be taking accountable [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=589.0s)]
*  for what it goes to the world order. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=594.0s)]
*  And that's probably the answer when it will finish. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=598.0s)]
*  But our focus and priority is to finish this war as soon as possible [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=603.4s)]
*  with victory and make them accountable for what they did. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn96_CwkBM&t=609.6s)]
