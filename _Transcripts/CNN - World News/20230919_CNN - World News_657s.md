*  The impact spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Southeast Asia [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=41.04s)]
*  It is a threat scale. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  I would like to thank those leaders who supported our Black Sea Grain Initiative [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=50.28s)]
*  and program Grain from Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=56.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=60.08s)]
*  United we made weapons turn back into food again. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=69.04s)]
*  More than 45 nations saw how important it is to make Ukrainian food products [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=74.2s)]
*  available on the market from Algeria to Spain to Indonesia and China. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=80.12s)]
*  And even now when Russia has undermined the Black Sea Grain Initiative, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=88.48s)]
*  we are working to ensure food stability. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=94.2s)]
*  And I hope that many of you will join us in these efforts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=97.6s)]
*  We launched a temporary sea export corridor from our ports [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=102.16s)]
*  and we are working hard to preserve the land routes for grain exports. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  And it is alarming to see how some in Europe, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=114.84s)]
*  some our friends in Europe play out solidarity in political theatre, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=119.04s)]
*  making thriller from the grain. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=125.0s)]
*  And they may seem to play their own role, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=127.68s)]
*  but in fact they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=130.84s)]
*  Second, weaponization of energy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  Many times the world has witnessed Russia using energy as a weapon. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  Kremlin weaponized oil and gas to weaken the leaders of other countries [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  when they came to the Red Square. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  And now, now this threat is even greater. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Russia is weaponizing nuclear energy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=160.64s)]
*  Not only it is spreading its unreliable nuclear power plant construction technologies, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=164.32s)]
*  but it is also turning other countries' power plants into real dirty bombs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=172.76s)]
*  Look please what Russia did to our Zaporizhja power plant. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=179.8s)]
*  Shelled it, occupied it, and now blackmails others with radiation leaks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=185.4s)]
*  Is there any sense to reduce nuclear weapons [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  when Russia is weaponizing nuclear power plants? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=195.52s)]
*  Scary question. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=199.52s)]
*  The global security architecture offers no response or protection [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=201.72s)]
*  against such a treacherous radiation threat. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  And there is no accountability for radiation blackmailers so far. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=211.24s)]
*  The sword example is children. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=217.2s)]
*  Children. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=221.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, various terrorist groups abduct children [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=223.4s)]
*  to put pressure on their families and societies. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=227.96s)]
*  But never before the mass kidnapping and deportation [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=233.48s)]
*  would become a part of the government policy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=236.8s)]
*  Not until now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=240.0s)]
*  We know the names of tens of thousands of children [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  and have evidence on hundreds of thousands of others kidnapped by Russia [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=247.2s)]
*  in the occupied territories of Ukraine and later deported. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=252.76s)]
*  The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrant for Putin for this crime. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=259.08s)]
*  And we are trying to get children back home. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=271.12s)]
*  But time, time goes by. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=273.96s)]
*  What will happen with them? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=277.56s)]
*  What will happen to them? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  And all ties with their families are broken. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  And this is clearly a genocide. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=289.84s)]
*  When hatred is weaponized against one nation, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=293.44s)]
*  it never stops there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=297.96s)]
*  Each decade, Russia starts a new war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=300.44s)]
*  Parts of Moldova and Georgia remain occupied. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=305.84s)]
*  Russia turns Syria into ruins. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=308.76s)]
*  And if not Russia, the chemical weapons would have never been used there in Syria. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=311.44s)]
*  Russia has almost swallowed Belarus. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  It is obviously threatening Kazakhstan and other Baltic states. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=323.2s)]
*  And the goal of the present war against Ukraine [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  is to torn our land, our people, our lives, our resources [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=333.6s)]
*  into a weapon against you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=338.44s)]
*  Against the international rules-based order. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  Many seats in the General Assembly Hall may become empty. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=345.92s)]
*  Empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  the aggressor scatters deaths and brings ruins even without nukes, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=362.2s)]
*  but the outcomes are alike. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=368.56s)]
*  We see towns, we see villages in Ukraine wiped out by Russian artillery, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=371.24s)]
*  leveled to the ground completely. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=377.56s)]
*  We see the war of drones. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=380.04s)]
*  We know the possible effects of spreading the war into the cyberspace. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  The artificial intelligence could be trained to combat well [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=387.8s)]
*  before it would learn to help the humanity. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank God people have not yet learned to use climate as a weapon. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=395.8s)]
*  Even though humanity is failing on its climate policy objectives, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  this means that extreme weather will still impact the normal global life [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  and some evil state will also weaponise its outcomes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  And when people in the streets of New York and other cities of the world [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  went out on climate protest, we all have seen them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=424.88s)]
*  And when people in Morocco and Libya and other countries die [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=429.76s)]
*  as a result of natural disasters, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=435.68s)]
*  and when islands and countries disappear underwater, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=438.64s)]
*  and when tornadoes and deserts are spreading into new territories, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=442.8s)]
*  and when all of this is happening, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=448.24s)]
*  one unnatural disaster in Moscow decided to launch a big war [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  and kill tens of thousands of people. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=456.84s)]
*  We have to stop it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=462.0s)]
*  We must act united to defeat the aggressor [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=464.92s)]
*  and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  As nukes are restrained, likewise the aggressor must be restrained [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=477.04s)]
*  and all his tools and methods of war. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=482.24s)]
*  Each war now can become final, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=485.44s)]
*  but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will not break again. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=488.44s)]
*  And it is not a dialogue between the so-called great powers [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=495.24s)]
*  somewhere behind the closed doors that can guarantee us all the new wars era, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=499.08s)]
*  but open war of all nations for peace. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=505.44s)]
*  Last year I presented the outlines of the Ukrainian peace formula [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=510.84s)]
*  at the UN General Assembly. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=516.8399999999999s)]
*  Later in Indonesia I presented the full formula, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  and over the past year the peace formula became the basis [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=523.8399999999999s)]
*  to update the existing security architecture. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  Now we can bring back to life the UN Charter [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=530.8399999999999s)]
*  and guarantee the full power for the rules-based world order. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=536.84s)]
*  And tomorrow I will present the DTS [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=540.84s)]
*  at a special meeting of the UN Security Council. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=543.84s)]
*  The main thing is that it is not only about Ukraine. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=547.84s)]
*  More than 140 states and international organisations [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=552.84s)]
*  have supported the Ukrainian peace formula fully or in part. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=558.84s)]
*  The Ukrainian peace formula is becoming global. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=563.84s)]
*  Its points offer solutions and steps that will stop all forms of weaponisation [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=566.84s)]
*  that Russia used against Ukraine and other countries [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=571.84s)]
*  and maybe used by other aggressors. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=575.84s)]
*  Look, for the first time in modern history [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=578.84s)]
*  we have a real chance to end the aggression on the terms of the nation [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=583.84s)]
*  which was attacked. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=588.84s)]
*  And this is a real chance for every nation [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=592.84s)]
*  to ensure that aggression against your state, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=595.84s)]
*  if it happens, God forbid, will end. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=598.84s)]
*  Not because your land will be divided [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=602.84s)]
*  and you will be forced to submit to military or political pressure, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=605.84s)]
*  but because your territory and sovereignty will be fully restored. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=609.84s)]
*  We launched the format of meetings between national security advisors [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=616.84s)]
*  and diplomatic representatives. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=620.84s)]
*  Important talks and consultations were held in Hiroshima, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=623.84s)]
*  in Copenhagen and in Jeddah [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=627.84s)]
*  on the implementation of the peace formula. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=630.84s)]
*  And we are preparing a global peace summit. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcmPFWsJJOU&t=634.84s)]
