# Ukraine says strike on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet HQ left dozens dead
**CNN - World News:** [September 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg)
*  Ukraine's special operations forces say the attack on Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=0.0s)]
*  left dozens dead and wounded, including senior leadership. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=5.5s)]
*  We're also seeing new video today of black smoke billowing from the building in the aftermath [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=9.58s)]
*  of that strike. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=14.46s)]
*  The special forces also claim the strike was timed to hit while senior members of Russia's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=15.74s)]
*  Navy were meeting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=21.66s)]
*  The attack comes as Ukraine continues its counteroffensive against Russian forces. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=23.26s)]
*  CNN's Fred Pleiken has more. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  Hi there, Fred. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=30.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians certainly believe that they have a bit of momentum going for them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=32.86s)]
*  In fact, I was able to sit down with the commanding general of Ukraine's counteroffensive in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=36.26s)]
*  South and he confirmed that they have managed a bit of a breakthrough near a town called [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=41.18s)]
*  Verbovna. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=45.18s)]
*  Of course, they do still have a long way to go, but he also said that that strike on the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=46.18s)]
*  Russian headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet is very important to their progress. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=51.14s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=55.66s)]
*  Smoke billowing from Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=58.3s)]
*  Moscow blaming Ukrainian-launched cruise missiles, Kiev only confirming they hit the building. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  I sat down with the commanding general for Ukraine's counteroffensive in the South, Olexandr [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=68.0s)]
*  Tarnovsky, and he tells me strikes like these are invaluable for his troops. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=72.88s)]
*  Destroyed command means a destroyed command link, and if there is no command, then there [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  are no coordinated actions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=83.88s)]
*  Hitting infrastructure like factories, bases, warehouses containing weapons is also a factor [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=85.6s)]
*  for victory. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=91.6s)]
*  In the past weeks alone, the Ukrainians say they've hit a Russian ship, a submarine, an [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=92.6s)]
*  air base and a surface-to-air missile system in occupied Crimea. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=98.24s)]
*  Still, Ukraine's president faces skepticism both from many Republican lawmakers and the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=102.08s)]
*  public about the U.S.'s continued support for Ukraine. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=107.36s)]
*  Tarnovsky asking for patience. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  We have one goal, liberation of our territories. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  However hard it is, we will keep on working. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And I want to thank even the skeptics. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=121.8s)]
*  Their criticism also influences our task's success. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=123.72s)]
*  It's been a slow grind for the Ukrainians on the southern front, progress so far incremental. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  But the question is, do you think that there will be a point when there will be a big push? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=134.0s)]
*  I believe so, and I think this point will be tokmak. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=138.4s)]
*  They are relying on the depth of the offensive line there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=142.72000000000003s)]
*  I worry less about the Suroviken line, more about the crossroads, tree lines and the minefields [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  between the tree lines. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=151.08s)]
*  But the U.S. has cautioned time might be running out as fall progresses, making the earth here [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  soggy and movement difficult. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=158.08s)]
*  How much do you think that you can achieve before the winter sets in? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  How far do you think your forces can get, realistically? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=165.12s)]
*  The weather can be a serious obstacle during an advance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  But considering how we move forward, mostly without using vehicles, I don't think the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  weather will heavily influence the counteroffensive. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=178.12s)]
*  General Tarnovsky says he remains optimistic that Ukraine's counteroffensive will be a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=181.4s)]
*  success, especially if Ukraine continues its campaign targeting Russian forces in the rear [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=185.36s)]
*  like Crimea. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=190.84s)]
*  As the commanding general of Ukraine's counteroffensive in the south, he also said that that strike [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=191.84s)]
*  on the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet is very important to boost the morale of his [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=197.34s)]
*  forces that are fighting in the field. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=201.5s)]
*  And he also said it's really important because he believes it really hurts the morale of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  the Russians, Fredrika. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=208.06s)]
*  All right, Fred Pleiken, thanks so much. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=209.06s)]
*  All right, let's bring in U.S. Army Brigadier General, retired Brigadier General Mark Kemet. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  He is also the former Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs under [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=217.98s)]
*  President George W. Bush. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=222.22s)]
*  Great to see you, General. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=224.22s)]
*  Sure, Fred. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=225.22s)]
*  So in your view, does it appear that the Russian defenses were caught off guard by that attack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=226.86s)]
*  and that this is pretty defeating? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=233.18s)]
*  Well, they certainly were caught off guard. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the fact that you could allow a headquarters of that magnitude get hit without any air [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=240.02s)]
*  defense or defenses around it indicates an incredible lapse in their operational security. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=245.3s)]
*  Will it make a difference? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=253.3s)]
*  I think, as the General said and as Fred said, it will be a morale boost for the Ukrainians. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=254.74s)]
*  It may hurt the morale of the Russians, but I don't think it's going to be very consequential [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=260.26s)]
*  in isolation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=265.18s)]
*  But there is a very interesting factor and there's very interesting shift on the battlefield [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=267.18s)]
*  that I think this is part of. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=272.1s)]
*  And even if senior leadership may have been killed or compromised during that strike? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=273.98s)]
*  Good militaries always have people that can step in for leaders. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=281.02s)]
*  As the nature of war, leaders get killed, somebody's got to be ready to step up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=284.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=287.74s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky was on Capitol Hill this week. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=288.74s)]
*  He was trying to shore up U.S. support in Congress. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=292.29999999999995s)]
*  Is it your expectation that the U.S. support in terms of aid, money, arsenal to Ukraine [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  will soften as we head into an election year? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  And if so, will that ultimately lead to a loss, as President Zelensky said? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=306.42s)]
*  He said, you know, they will lose the war if there is diminished U.S. support. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't think we're going to see diminished support. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  I just think this administration needs to make a harder case. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  And so does President Zelensky. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=326.26000000000005s)]
*  And I think he is doing that now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=327.82000000000005s)]
*  The subtle shift that I'm seeing is very interesting. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=330.94000000000005s)]
*  We're seeing less and less focus on the ground counteroffensive in Ukraine and more and more [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=334.18s)]
*  activity against the naval forces on the sea and, as we saw, this hit against the naval [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=339.98s)]
*  headquarters on the land. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  So it could very well be that the shift on the battlefield from focusing in Ukraine to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=349.3s)]
*  focusing on Crimea, number one, will certainly lift the morale of the Ukrainian forces. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=354.18s)]
*  But I think it will also demonstrate to the Western allies that there is being progress [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=360.5s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=366.94s)]
*  There is progress being made on the ground, not necessarily in the north, but certainly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=367.94s)]
*  what's happening down in Crimea on the ground there and on the sea. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=372.66s)]
*  The new U.S. aid package to Ukraine would include controversial cluster bombs. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=377.62s)]
*  Will that make a huge difference? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=383.06s)]
*  Not really. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=385.54s)]
*  Buster bombs being used by both sides for quite some time, for about six months now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  What will make a difference is also this announcement that we will start using the long-range ATAK [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=391.38s)]
*  missiles. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=396.74s)]
*  That will have a consequence on the battlefield. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=397.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=399.66s)]
*  Let me shift gears now to the Middle East. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=400.66s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week saying Israel is close to a normalization [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=402.62s)]
*  agreement with Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=407.66s)]
*  This is what he told CNN. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  Do you feel that a deal is likely? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=413.38s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=415.74s)]
*  I think it's likely because I think Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States share [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=418.86s)]
*  a common goal to change history, to make this quantum leap, another quantum leap for peace. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=423.38s)]
*  We had one with the Abraham Accords with the United States, and we now have an opportunity [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=429.94s)]
*  with the United States to change the Middle East forever. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=435.1s)]
*  So General, would this kind of agreement dramatically shift the state of play in the Middle East? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=440.1s)]
*  Well, look, I think the Netanyahu talk was very important, but even more important was [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=445.86s)]
*  the talk with Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince inside of Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=450.38s)]
*  He made a larger shift in policy, to my mind, than any other Saudi leader has in 50 years. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=455.78000000000003s)]
*  The fact that Saudi Arabia is now willing to normalize with Israel. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=464.54s)]
*  Israel has always wanted to normalize under the right conditions with Saudi Arabia, but [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=469.58000000000004s)]
*  this flexibility being shown by Mohammed bin Salman for the purposes of normalizing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=474.54s)]
*  with Israel is tremendously significant. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, it could lead exactly to what President Netanyahu said, which is good relations [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=483.26000000000005s)]
*  between those two countries in a way that we haven't seen before. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=489.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=493.1s)]
*  General Mark Kemet, thank you so much. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=494.1s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=496.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7yy7uuXVBg&t=497.3s)]
