# Video purports to show Russian admiral attending meeting
**CNN - World News:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY)
*  More clashing claims from the Kremlin and Kiev over the fate of a top Russian admiral. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=0.0s)]
*  On Monday, Ukraine said it killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=5.72s)]
*  Take a look at this video, which the Russian Ministry of Defence released just a short [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  time ago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=16.56s)]
*  It appears to show Admiral Sokolov appearing via video conference in a meeting with Russian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=17.56s)]
*  military leaders. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=25.1s)]
*  Of course, that he is alive and well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=27.1s)]
*  Ukraine now says it's quote, clarifying its information. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=30.5s)]
*  All this hours after Russian drones bore down on Ukraine's Odessa region overnight. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=34.7s)]
*  Let's try to make sense of this with CNN's Fred Plykkin. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  He is live from eastern Ukraine for you this hour. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=44.18000000000001s)]
*  So competing claims. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=47.66s)]
*  Kremlin says one thing, Kiev says another. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=50.06s)]
*  What do we know about the alleged death of Admiral Sokolov? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=53.42s)]
*  Well so far, Becky, the Ukrainians aren't at least officially backing down from their [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  claims and you mentioned that they said they were re-evaluating or clarifying the information [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=63.86s)]
*  that they got. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=68.1s)]
*  We have to keep in mind that they had said that after a strike that they conducted on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=69.1s)]
*  the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol, in the night from Thursday to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=71.86s)]
*  Friday of last week, that they had killed 34 senior officers in that strike, including [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=76.14s)]
*  the commander of the Black Sea fleet, Admiral Victor Sokolov. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  Now of course, the Russians seem to be trying to show that he is still very much alive. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=85.98s)]
*  At least you had that video of the defense minister Sergei Shoigu holding a meeting with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  some of his top commanders, some of his top generals and there seems to be Victor Sokolov [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=94.42s)]
*  on the screen there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=100.5s)]
*  Now the interesting thing that we've gotten from the Russians in the past couple of days [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=102.22s)]
*  is actually that they really haven't said very much. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=105.22s)]
*  The Ukrainians had put that claim out there that Sokolov had been killed and the Russians [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=107.4s)]
*  were really silent for about 24 hours saying nothing about that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=110.82s)]
*  And they still haven't officially said anything about it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  In fact, earlier today there was a conference call between the spokesman of the Kremlin, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=116.41999999999999s)]
*  Dmitry Peskov, and journalists where he was asked if he knew anything about the fate of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  Victor Sokolov. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  And he said that this is something for the defense ministry to answer and certainly something [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  that was not in his remit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  So officially the Russians have not denied that he has been killed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  It seems as though they're trying to portray that things are business to usual, maybe that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=138.74s)]
*  they won't even comment on all of this, but certainly they seem to show that he is very [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=142.86s)]
*  much alive. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=148.38s)]
*  Again, it's impossible to independently verify when that video was taken. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=149.38s)]
*  The Ukrainians are saying that they're reevaluating it, but certainly right now it seems as though [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  the indications are that he could very well be alive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=158.24s)]
*  And all this, of course, as you mentioned, Becky, as those attacks in the Odessa region [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  with grain facilities having been hit there in the overnight hour in a massive drone attack [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=165.98s)]
*  that happened there, Becky. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=172.06s)]
*  Fred Plankin is on the ground for you folks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=174.94s)]
*  All right, the mystery surrounding the fate of a high ranking Russian commander is deepening. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=177.66s)]
*  Ukraine isn't backing off claims that it killed Victor Sokolov, the head of Russia's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=184.7s)]
*  Black Sea Fleet, last week. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=189.18s)]
*  Russia's Ministry of Defense released this video earlier that appears to show Sokolov [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=191.98s)]
*  alive and well. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, CNN can't confirm where or when this meeting took place or even if it's Sokolov [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=196.94s)]
*  that we're seeing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=202.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with Ukraine's new defense minister, Rustam Umarov, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=203.5s)]
*  wouldn't confirm or deny whether Sokolov had been killed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=208.22s)]
*  CNN Chief International Anchor, Kristyan Amanpour, joins us now for more on this from London. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=211.98s)]
*  Kristyan, this is fascinating. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=217.78s)]
*  I am interested in hearing more on what this new defense minister had told you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=219.62s)]
*  And it's notable that this information is coming now given that the U.S. did not seem [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=224.82s)]
*  to back up Ukraine's initial claims that Sokolov had been killed in this attack. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=229.26s)]
*  Bianna, exactly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  So there was an attack launched against Sevastopol, which is the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=236.46s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=242.86s)]
*  In that, the Ukrainians then claimed they had killed the commander, as you mentioned. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=244.18s)]
*  So when I got the chance to ask actually the Ukrainian brand new defense minister today, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=249.14s)]
*  he was a little vague. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=256.18s)]
*  Minister, can you confirm that the head of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Viktor Sokolov, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=258.26s)]
*  is in fact dead or alive? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=265.9s)]
*  Well, first of all, he is in our temporary occupied territory, so he is not, he should [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=267.9s)]
*  not be there at all. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=274.38s)]
*  So if he is that, it's a good news for everybody that we are continuing to decopy our territory. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=276.06s)]
*  So that is the word from the defense ministry. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=284.26s)]
*  Obviously, they are having to really go into detail to see whether in fact their claims [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=287.5s)]
*  can be borne out. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=292.02s)]
*  But at the moment, we just don't know. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=293.74s)]
*  So we're going to wait and see what happens. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  But more importantly, he did tell us that this is now entering a new phase, this war, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=296.5s)]
*  for the war machine and for the whole country, for the economy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=302.38s)]
*  He said the defense ministry would be in a reboot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=305.74s)]
*  They're going to increase localized manufacturing of arms as they see the signs, the political [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=308.78s)]
*  signs from the West that they potentially might be slowing down deliveries to Ukraine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=314.14s)]
*  So they're really getting into it for the long haul. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  Bianna, we'll wait to see what happens. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=323.06s)]
*  Yeah, so fascinating, Christiane. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=324.98s)]
*  Did he talk more about the timing of the change? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=326.88s)]
*  As you noted, he is new to this position. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=329.98s)]
*  He is well known internationally, especially among financial leaders. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=332.78s)]
*  But what is he expecting to do now in this new role? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=337.14s)]
*  Well, you know, he wouldn't go into massive detail. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  He is brand new. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=343.61999999999995s)]
*  I just spoken to him as he had come out of a meeting with President Zelensky, but already [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=344.61999999999995s)]
*  they have dismissed, as you know, six of seven deputy defense ministers. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=348.88s)]
*  Already they're talking in a slightly different way to the people of Ukraine, getting them [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=354.02s)]
*  used to the fact that this is not going to end anytime soon. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  He did say that they're really looking forward to finally getting the M1A1 Abram tanks, which [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=362.14s)]
*  they very much need. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=368.97999999999996s)]
*  And if you remember, they were promised in January. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  So now almost 10 months later, they're getting these tanks. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=372.34s)]
*  He said they're really waiting to get the fighter jets. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=375.7s)]
*  They really, really hope that the United States will provide them with so-called ATTACMs, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  the long range artillery, and they for sure need ammunition. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=383.86s)]
*  And we even hear that the NATO countries in Europe, for instance, may not be able to meet [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=388.42s)]
*  their very big promise of a million rounds of 155 millimeter artillery shells for Ukraine [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=393.82s)]
*  by the end of this or within a year. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  They made that pledge in the spring and they're not near to meeting that target, which means [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=402.44s)]
*  the defense ministry really does have to gear up and reboot what used to be a very prominent [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  arms industry. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=414.3s)]
*  Obviously in the post-Soviet era, it hasn't been so prominent. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=415.3s)]
*  So again, for obvious reasons, he didn't want to go into details, but I think you can tell [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=418.58s)]
*  that that's where the trajectory is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=423.38s)]
*  As to when the war will end and what is the end game, he continues to say their maximalist [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=425.22s)]
*  goals, which means when Russia is pushed back to the borders that they consider rightly [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=431.1s)]
*  theirs. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=437.86s)]
*  Yeah, and President Biden alluded to President Zelensky last week in Washington that these [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=438.86s)]
*  attack on maybe on their way and coming to Ukraine soon. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=442.38s)]
*  Christiane Amanpour, this is an interview that many had been hoping to see and I'm glad [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=446.14s)]
*  you got this first interview with this new defense minister. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=450.14s)]
*  We'll be seeing more of you in the next hour with your interview. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=453.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCoV9fFQlY&t=457.09999999999997s)]
