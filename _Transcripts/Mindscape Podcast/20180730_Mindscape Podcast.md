Video Description: Blog post (w/ audio player): https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2018/07/30/episode-7-yascha-mounk-on-threats-to-liberal-democracy/

Both words in the phrase "liberal democracy" carry meaning, and both concepts are under attack around the world. "Democracy" means that they people rule, while "liberal" (in this sense) means that the rights of individuals are protected, even if they're not part of the majority. Recent years have seen the rise of an authoritarian/populist political movement in many Western democracies, one that scapegoats minorities in the name of the true "will of the people." Yascha Mounk is someone who has been outspoken from the start about the dangers posed by this movement, and what those of us who support the ideals of liberal democracy can do about it. Among other things, we discuss how likely it is that liberal democracy could ultimately fail even in as stable a country as the United States.

Yascha Mounk received his Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University. He is a Lecturer on Government at Harvard, a Senior Fellow in the Political Reform Program at New America, and Executive Director at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. His most recent book is The People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It.

# Episode 7: Yascha Mounk on Threats to Liberal Democracy
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 30, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD4KEWCdxG4)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll.
*  Back in the early 1990s there was an idea going around called the end of history. The Berlin
*  Wall had fallen, the USSR was dissolving. There was a feeling that history had been very interesting,
*  you know, thousands of years of conflict and war and trying out different forms of government and
*  society but that now as the 20th century came to a close we had more or less figured it out. The
*  way to live is in a liberal democracy and liberal democracy was gaining ascendance throughout the
*  world. Even old dictatorships or authoritarian regimes were crumbling under the democratic
*  pressures. As it turns out the idea of democracy is not necessarily a stable one. You can have a
*  democratic society that gets rid of its democratic institutions for one reason or another and a
*  couple of centuries, which is the time period over which democracy has been ascendant in the
*  Western world, is a short period historically. Right now we're in a period where the world is
*  changing rapidly in many ways and you can't just say everything is done politically. We figured it
*  out. We're all going to be liberal Democrats going forward. Indeed, as many of you might have noticed,
*  just over the past couple years there has been increasing anti-democratic sentiment around the
*  world. It can be very blatant in some places. Some countries have elected through democratic
*  means quite explicitly anti-democratic leaders. Here in the United States there's certainly been
*  controversies and arguments about whether or not our new Trump administration is not getting in line
*  with the norms of liberal democracy, attacking the media, undercutting our confidence in our
*  electoral processes and so forth. Around the world strong men and autocratic forces are ascendant
*  and you can have different opinions about this. You can think that this is a real problem and if
*  you do think it's a real problem then I think that it's something that is not just alarmism.
*  I think that if you are of the opinion that this is happening and this is bad there's more than
*  enough evidence that we should really take this seriously. You might on the other hand think that
*  this is just liberals complaining that they lost the election, they're not used to having a strong
*  leader they have to fight against and if that's true okay but it's up to you to articulate exactly
*  why it's okay to attack the media in certain ways. What should be the norms that are always respected
*  no matter who is the boss, no matter which party is in power. This is not an easy thing to do. So
*  it's important that we think about these things and today's guest is Yasha Monk who is one of the
*  most interesting and articulate people who is thinking seriously and carefully about these
*  issues right now. Dr. Monk is a lecturer on government at Harvard University, he's also a
*  senior fellow in the political reform program at New America and he's also the executive director
*  at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. In his spare time apparently he writes a weekly
*  column at Slate online and he also hosts a podcast of his own over there called The Good
*  Fight. His most recent book is The People vs. Democracy Why Our Freedom is in Danger and How
*  to Save It. I strongly recommend reading this book. It's an eye-opener, it can be depressing if you
*  take it seriously and if you don't take it seriously if you don't disagree with it then as I said it's
*  important to explicitly say in as reasonable calm and persuasive a ways you can why we shouldn't
*  be worried about these things. One way or another this is something we all have to be thinking about.
*  So let's go.
*  Yasha Monk, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. My pleasure. So I'll start with a little preamble
*  here because I'll admit on the one hand I'm very excited to have you on the podcast both because
*  I've loved your work on Twitter and in other places since I discovered it and also because
*  you're a fellow podcaster you're the first guest I've had who is an expert on being on both sides
*  of this microphone. I'm a great professional and I'm gonna judge you on every transgression. Well
*  I know that yes that's what I'm looking forward to. I want the report card after it's all said and
*  done. But there's also trepidation because it's politics and even if it's political science and
*  intellectual scholarship and so forth there is the nitty-gritty ugly tribalism of politics and
*  what I'm trying to get around in this podcast is exactly that trying to aim for the underlying
*  ideas the big picture. So there is a big picture. There's certainly we all know here in the United
*  States there's certain political things going on but it's not just a random particular event.
*  There are some trends underlying what's going on here in the US and it's going on more broadly
*  right. The world is seeing at least it seems from the news an upsurge in a kind of populist,
*  nativist, nationalist, isolationist, authoritarian moment. So just to start out why don't we let's
*  imagine that over the next hour we'll be digging in to some of the underlying reasons why that's
*  happening. But what's your take right now on sort of the state of the world when it comes to this
*  kind of movement going on? Well I'm pretty worried about what's going on in the world. I was just
*  writing an article where I started outlining how different some countries in the world look three
*  years ago. You know three years ago the Huffington Post had just announced to great hilarity that it
*  would cover the presidential campaign by one Donald J. Crump in the entertainment section.
*  In Britain you had not somebody a person you would have voted for but a very reasonable moderate
*  center-right minister and David Cameron. You know the idea of Brexit was being pursued by the UK
*  Independence Party and a few hardliners in the Tory party but it really seemed very unlikely.
*  There was a leadership election in the Labour Party which you know seemed to probably go to
*  relatively sensible person. In Germany Angela Merkel was at the height of her popularity and
*  you know there wasn't any far-right populist party in the Parliament. Now you know today you are
*  seeing not just authoritarian populists in power in the United States with Donald Trump, in places
*  like the Philippines with Rigo Duterte, in Poland, in Hungary, in Italy and a whole bunch of other
*  places even in the countries that are supposedly working relatively well. In the countries where
*  populists have not yet taken over you have seen these radical transformations of a political system.
*  So today in Germany the alternative for Germany which is quite extreme is in the Bundestag and
*  according to some polls it is now the second biggest party in the country, larger than the
*  Social Democrats. In Great Britain you now have a leader of the Labour Party who bears more
*  resemblance to Jill Stein than he does to Bernie Sanders. You have a prime minister who is embattled
*  from the far right of her own party, may lose her job any moment now and you've had two years of the
*  establishment trying to figure out what on earth to do about the population's vote to Brexit and
*  not really making any progress in figuring out what the plans of the country should be. So just as a
*  snapshot of some of the changes in the world I would say it doesn't look too good. And fairly
*  recently I mean that the picture you paint is one of rapid change which might even be extra worrying
*  right? Yeah absolutely so it comes on the heels of a long development when you look at the rise of
*  populist parties and movements. It started in at least the year 2000 even earlier than that and
*  has been rising since. So some 18 years ago the average vote share of a populist party in continental
*  Europe for example was about 7% now it is more like 27 or 28% that's a very rapid increase. We
*  see them now being in power in a whole set of countries. You can drive from north to south of
*  Europe without ever leaving a country ruled by populists. That certainly wasn't possible 10 or
*  15 years ago and it's become particularly fast in the last few years in part because the populists
*  are now at levels of strength where they can suddenly form the government. I mean as a physicist
*  you think about those kinds of things over time I imagine which is to say you have systems that
*  seem relatively stable and you start seeing a certain kind of change in them but it doesn't
*  seem to worry people don't notice it too much because the system on the whole is still stable
*  and then eventually as it comes close to a certain kind of threshold you see that a small increase
*  has much bigger systemic effects. I think that's the kind of moment we're now in with populism.
*  Yeah that's exactly right. The idea of a phase transition where things can be more or less on
*  appearances fairly stable over long periods of time then suddenly something happens. My wife
*  Jennifer Ouellette who is a science writer is actually working on a book on this very topic
*  exploring the fact that while things can seem to not be changing to our most direct observations
*  things can be changing underneath the surface that secretly lead up to these apparently radical
*  quick transformations and they can be good you know public opinions switched about gay marriage
*  here in the United States very quickly but secretly it was being it was changing all along and it can
*  be for the bad just as well. Well I hope she's gonna add a topic about the cheery topic of populism.
*  Oh yeah well so that's a good point because I want to dig in a little bit deeper here what
*  is the definition of populism? When I was a kid and I heard the word it made no sense to me like
*  populism means you're popular and if you're in a democracy you should be popular to be elected
*  but of course it means something a little bit different than that. Yeah and you know I mean I
*  think that is a real problem with that word on many public appearances where I try to define
*  populism I try to explain to people what I mean by it what's the definition of it is people then
*  the questions in the question session say well what's wrong with popularism not populism but
*  popularism you know should politicians try to be popular and of course they should it's a normal
*  part of politics for politicians to say hey you know people are unhappy with the current crop of
*  politicians and I'm gonna point out the ways in which they are imperfect and mistaken and I'm
*  gonna try and rile up a little bit of emotion against them and say hey I'm standing for all
*  of those popular things that they haven't actually thought about so that's perfectly normal. What's
*  different about populism is the claim that the only real reason why we have problems today is
*  that the existing political elite has corrupt or self-serving the claim that they alone truly stand
*  for the people that while they are the voice of the people everybody who disagrees with them is
*  by nature of that illegitimate because if I stand for the people and somebody disagrees with me
*  well then they are against the people and then it often goes together with you know very large
*  extreme promises so that once populists are in power and they can't live up to those promises
*  as our president sometimes likes to say who knew that things could be so complicated
*  who knew that healthcare could be so complicated I think if he was a student in one of your classes
*  Sean he might upon seeing the F on his midterm say who knew that physics could be so complicated
*  um yeah but they don't want to actually admit that they told lies and and and made huge outside
*  promises and so they start to blame they say well why haven't I been able to deliver for you
*  because the opposition are traitors and they're undermining me because the three press are fake
*  news and they need to be regulated because the independent institutions like like judges or the
*  FBI are all biased against me and they now need to have the independence taken away
*  that's why populism is worried right and so so i'm getting the impression that in some sense
*  populism is defined in opposition to this group of elites and maybe that's an ill-defined group but
*  it's the populace versus these people who have the power and don't deserve it and need to be
*  brought under control is that fair yeah that's that's that's right um and you know that's again
*  there's an element to that that is normal in democracy but you say hey you know the people
*  in power right now aren't really serving everybody's interests and and and we need to correct that but
*  but but it goes together for populists with a real lack of respect for the most basic rules and norms
*  of political systems so you know the thing was very shocking in the united states in 2016 that
*  a presidential candidate would you know leave in doubt whether he will accept the outcome of the
*  election that he would um not just attack his opponent as having the wrong ideas or perhaps
*  even not being as morally upright as he is um better saying i'm going to lock her up right
*  those things are very typical populists that unwillingness to accept the kinds of rules we
*  need not because they're important in themselves or because we somehow have a weird sort of attachment
*  to norms but because in order for democracy to work i need to not only be able to elect the guy
*  i want today i also need to be sure that he's gonna respect the rules and constraints of his
*  power enough so that i have a chance of electing somebody else four years from now um and in many
*  countries that doesn't happen yeah i've always thought that the real birth of a democracy is
*  the first time that the party in power faces an election and loses and hands it over right and so
*  you can win an election that's great but we assume it's part of you know having norms and so forth
*  and we'll probably get into that but we assume that there are rules that everyone agrees to play by
*  and certainly in addition to attacking the media attacking the legitimacy of elections is
*  unfortunately common these days uh yeah no that's that's that's exactly right um you know the real
*  test of a democracy um is whether politicians are willing to cede power when they lose um
*  and uh you know in many cases we haven't yet seen the test for populace in part because and this is
*  another test they have skewed the playing field so much that the opposition doesn't have a real
*  chance of winning so what we're seeing increasingly is that you don't have uh political systems in
*  which uh you know somebody says hey i'm dictated now there's never going to be an election again
*  countries like russia countries like venezuela have elections yeah but there are elections in
*  which some of the most promising candidates of your position aren't allowed to run in which
*  they might even be put in jail in which if you go to a protest or a rally for the opposition candidate
*  you might be beaten up by the police or you might be locked away um all of the main television
*  channels are under control of the regime or of close allies of it um you have uh
*  changes to the electoral system that are meant to favor the governing party and you take all of
*  those things together and you basically have managed elections in which people can go out to
*  vote but the opposition doesn't have a fair shot at victory and so what we're seeing in places like
*  hungary uh is that the countries are rapidly moving towards such a system um and even if despite all
*  of those obstacles your position should somehow win i have real questions in my mind about whether
*  a victor arman for example would voluntarily step down from power well it's always been in physics
*  terms as we were talking about before there's always been an instability in the very idea of
*  democracy if you're a dictatorship and you know you just keep the squeeze of power carefully enough
*  you can go on forever in a democracy there's always the worry that the people will democratically
*  elect anti-democratic rulers and that's an instability if everyone chooses to be non-democratic
*  then democracy can't survive it's sort of the political science equivalent of carl popper's
*  uh question about tolerance tolerating the intolerant can be a bad thing so these societies
*  that are democratic base based their success on the idea that people buy into the idea of being
*  democratic which is not just voting for the person you want but giving up power when you don't want
*  it are we seeing the people in these countries become less willing to give up power when they
*  lose um right or to to the people i think are more willing and tempted to vote for politicians who
*  give good signs of not respecting the limits on their power which is one of the reasons why the
*  title of my book is the people versus democracy right it captures that otherwise paradoxical idea
*  that people vote for a candidate who says hey you know what just trust me leave me all the power
*  things are going to work out somehow by the way that sound you may hear in the background i believe
*  is donald trump flying into london overhead um uh so so you know just leave leave it to me i'll
*  fix it just give me a little bit more power um trust me right but then they start to use that
*  power precisely in order to make it impossible to displace a democratically elected president or
*  prime minister by democratic means by the way if you want to hear about um the scientists ideas of
*  the flaws of democracy i have a story for you oh yes please tell me the good science story
*  so i i i i will not remember the details here and i may butcher and and even embellish a little bit
*  in the process but um there's a great story came across about a year ago of um uh kurt girdle uh the
*  great uh a logician um uh wanting to take a citizenship so he had come to the united states
*  being the nazis he was one of his best buddies with albert einstein who was also there at the
*  same time um and uh you know he was becoming eligible for citizenship um and he had to take
*  citizenship test and so you know he came to einstein who had already gone through a process and
*  said what what should i do to study for this exam and einstein said well look you know they send you
*  leaflet just read for leaflet you'll be fine but um girdle was not one to take this kind of thing
*  without the requisite seriousness and started to really study up very deeply on the constitution
*  and and the separation of powers and how it all works um and uh on the day of of the exam einstein
*  decided to to go to the test with girdle as moral support um for he seems to have been a little bit
*  of a jackass because on the on the on the road trip over um he started to ask girdle well are
*  you sure that you really have prepared well enough for this exam and so on a little comes in a little
*  bit of a crack of nerves and um recognizing einstein they asked her both of them into an
*  office and einstein is allowed to to sit there as as a president ministered and um you know the the
*  the official sort of does a little bit of makes a little small talk with girdle and says all right
*  you know oh i see you come from austria you know horrible what's what's what's been happening there
*  and girdle says yes terrible what's happening my country's terms as well um you know thankfully um
*  now you're in the united states something like that could never happen here and girdle says well
*  actually i have been studying the constitution and there's a deep flaw and einstein kicks him
*  under the table says shut up and he just answers a couple of questions yeah being completely
*  truthful is not always uh the best strategy in the in these situations i i wonder if girdle was
*  in fact just thinking of the fact that you could vote you that the constitution allows
*  itself to be changed you can change it to be anything you want and so which brings us to
*  another thing in your book you know and i would go further than that which is it's not just that
*  the constitution can be changed which by the way is very difficult in the united states but it's
*  ultimately people have to stand up for the incident but if you have a president who does
*  not respect the rightful limits of his authority and he controls a political party which also
*  happens to have a majority in congress and which also happens to have uh judges in the supreme
*  court whose loyalty to a particular ideological movement goes more deeply than their loyalty to
*  constitutional values and values of their institution then they can in practice get
*  away with all kinds of things that might in theory not be allowed and that is ultimately what danger
*  has always been that political forces take over a system and they simply do things that on a fair
*  reading of a local constitution they shouldn't be allowed to do but because there are the people
*  who are actually in in the offices of institutions that are meant to stop them don't do the job have
*  a higher loyalty to a party or a man than the constitution they get away with doing it themselves
*  so perhaps this was good i was thinking sadly um uh the record of of this story does not explain
*  what girdle actually fought the floor was so there could be all sorts of flaws that we don't
*  that we don't even see but but yeah it may be a flaw that only girdle was brilliant enough to see
*  you're putting your finger on you know the role of buy-in to the democratic process to the norms
*  that we have i mean one of the big things that has been uh highlighted in in the recent years
*  since trump has been elected is the extent to which we do rely on people behaving well not simply
*  uh following the law as it is written but following the spirit of the law in some sense as well and so
*  is this another new thing or is this just something that they were less artful about
*  taking advantage of before it seems to me that in the past there was less political polarization
*  at least here in the u.s and there was more belief in the standards of um you should do the
*  right thing even if it doesn't benefit your party i've been recently re-watching the the west wing
*  and there's you know an episode where a republican committee chairman stops one of the people on his
*  committee from questioning a democratic witness because it wasn't on the topic that they were
*  supposed to be investigating even though it would have been devastating to the democratic party for
*  them to do that and we're sitting there thinking there's just no way that that would happen right
*  now if if you can take the advantage you would just win so it does seem like something has really
*  changed well there's lots of things that happen the west thing that never happened in real life
*  one of which is that people always have the perfect retort you know it's the world that everybody had
*  two hours to think of the next move um uh uh but but no i think there is a real transformation there
*  which is caused by a whole set of things one of them is rising polarization um
*  the public as a whole in the united states is not necessarily more extreme the political views
*  were more polarized now than they were 20 or 40 or 60 years ago so the political parties are
*  so the most moderate democrat used to be far too
*  from a conservative than the most moderate republican that is no longer the case there is
*  a real gulf between them um and uh and we also see by the way many people just having less of
*  an understanding of the constitution i think for a long time there was a very deep commitment to
*  the idea of having to transmit political values from one generation to the next um the idea of
*  a founding fathers of how important it is to have a constitutional culture and i think because we
*  start to take our democracy for granted we slightly took civic education for granted and we know from
*  various studies from people know much much less now about just the most basic aspects of a
*  constitution the kinds of things you need to pass citizenship test how many supreme court justices
*  are there and so on than they did a few decades ago um i also think that there is a strange element
*  of a useful fiction having been exposed i mean even two or three years ago when you go back through
*  what some of the most intelligent commentators were writing and i didn't agree with them at the
*  time but they were you know some of the smartest people writing about this making thoughtful
*  arguments they said look something like donald trump a ceiling of how much support somebody can
*  get like that can get you know people have this deep commitment to the constitution to these norms
*  if somebody says these kinds of outrageous things or tells these kinds of lies most people are just
*  going to be so turned off by them that they're gonna run away from it and and now we're seeing
*  that's not the case and that encourages more and more people to act in the same way because apparently
*  all of those things that we thought we would be deeply punished for we're not punished for right
*  it's like you know you have an electric fence uh that bars your your road to uh you know the
*  supermarket and you always sort of walk around it and one day you know by mistake you touch it and
*  you realize well you know what actually i didn't get a shock from it this time so perhaps i'll try
*  again tomorrow and once you've done that seven or eight times you know there's no longer a cost
*  in your mind to touching the electric fence because perhaps there was never a cost to it
*  but now we know yeah one of the great things in your book is that you closely analyze the phrase
*  liberal democracy i think a lot of people will just sort of blurt that out as if it's one
*  thing but there are two words there liberal and democracy and you point out that they
*  mean different things and they're both under attack in different ways although ways that might
*  come together in some way so why don't you uh help us understand that sure i'm the first thing to say
*  is that justice populism isn't popularism which which which seems obvious but is important
*  liberal democracy is not the opposite of conservative democracy right it's a philosophical
*  term in the sense in which i use liberal uh you know barack obama was as much of a liberal as
*  you know as george r.b bush or ron reagan or bill clinton they all had a basic commitment
*  to those values so so we use this term liberal democracy and we don't often think about what it
*  means and how it is that those two elements the liberal element and the democratic element may
*  actually be in tension with each other so the way that i understand it um our political system has
*  these two fundamental goals the first is to allow individual liberty that's the liberal element
*  liberty right classical liberalism yeah well classicalism has certain connotations that
*  about economic policy for example which aren't necessarily entailed but but it is
*  a set of freedoms that individuals enjoy um so that means that i can say what i want i can
*  worship as i want or not worship i can be in whatever relationship i want to be i'll be in
*  a relationship um and and nobody gets to tell me that and in order to sustain that i need
*  both things like freedom of speech and we need to have a separation of powers
*  because if the president dislikes what i say he can't be capable of just throwing me in
*  prison we need independent institutions to do uh prosecution right so that offending somebody
*  with political power can be dangerous too so that's the first element and the second element
*  is very straightforward especially once you've separated the liberal element out it's a democratic
*  element it's that uh well you actually need to be able to translate popular views into public
*  policies democracy is the rule of the demos rule of the people so actually what happens politically
*  needs to be dependent on what we as individuals want rather than being determined by a king or
*  a dictator or a priest or an imam or a jungle my fear is that these two constitutive elements of
*  our political system are coming apart more and more but for a long time we've had political systems
*  but i've been reasonably good with some obvious shortcomings about respecting and protecting
*  individual rights but they haven't done a terribly good job of actually being responsive to popular
*  opinion and now what we're getting is a political system in which uh yes at least at first some
*  popular views are being translated into public policy but it is at the price of
*  individual rights of the rise of minorities and increasingly of the kinds of separation of powers
*  that we need to sustain in order for the system to be stable over time well this this brings up yeah
*  so there's two directions to go here let's go in both of them but first um in some sense you're
*  you're suggesting that there are countries or super country kind of organizations like the
*  european union that are in fact anti-democratic that they are doing things behind the scenes that
*  it's even in the united states where we still have elections there's so much of everyday
*  governmental activity that is done by you know executive departments people who are not elected
*  but have an enormous power over people's lives and there is sort of a legitimate complaint that
*  people have that their views are not being put into public policy there's this whole invisible
*  structure that is making things happen and so in some sense that's a fair critique of the current
*  system is that right um yeah i mean i think i wouldn't go so far as to say that it's anti-democratic
*  which sort of implies a conspiracy against the people or conspiracy against democracy i think
*  it's a little less exciting than that and so i would say undemocratic which sounds similar
*  but it is different and important respect because that it's often a response to quite real
*  um requirements so our economy has become much more complex
*  the needs of public policy have become more complicated in part because we need much more
*  international cooperation because it's harder to govern the economy and so what we've seen over
*  the last you know 50 or 60 years in virtually every country is the rise of a set of institutions that
*  do constrain popular will in complicated ways so on the one hand we just have parliaments congress
*  in the united states not being responsive enough to what people want because the rising role of
*  money in politics and revolving door between lobbies and legislators and all those kinds of things
*  and on the other hand we have you know the rise of independent agencies like the environmental
*  protection agency or consumer protection bureau we have a central bank that's both much more powerful
*  and in certain ways more independent than we used to be we have a huge expansion of judicial
*  review and the growing importance and politicization of the supreme court we have
*  international trade treaties lots of international agencies to deal with all kinds of issues and you
*  know these things aren't a conspiracy against the people they are often you know responding to the
*  fact for example that it's really hard to figure out how to keep a power plant safe and that you
*  need lots of experts to make that decision and having congress vote in a day and day out probably
*  doesn't make a lot of sense so why don't we create an agency that can pass a lot of those nuts and
*  bolts regulations and congress has the authority to abolish that agency but it's probably not
*  right but there's there's a real logic behind this but cumulatively it does raise the danger that
*  people look at what's going on and say you know what for most of this stuff i'm never consulted
*  i don't even understand what it really all means congress certainly is making those decisions
*  so how is this really a democracy yeah i think i mean this is i think is dawning on me during
*  this conversation i think this is a very very important point that even putting aside all the
*  questions about nativism and racism and immigration and so forth there is a thing that is going on
*  that is purely based on the fact that the world is becoming more complicated more interconnected
*  technology is advancing you know we see this in purely technological realms where there are
*  computer programs that do really really important functions in the world that nobody understands
*  right no one person knows what's going on inside that computer program and the same thing is true
*  about government nobody understands everything that's going on and maybe you could imagine a
*  nightmare scenario where two things happen simultaneously one is that people become frustrated
*  that their needs are not being met that they're not getting ahead they see the government is sort
*  of big and invisible and elitist and unresponsive and they vote populists into power as a response
*  to that and at the same time all this complication gives more ways for the people who are really up
*  in the game people who are powerful and wealthy and connected to take advantage of it and to
*  increase their own wealth so we see this combination of populism and growing inequality
*  when you say that out loud that's a plausible picture of what we're faced with right now
*  yeah absolutely and and and this particular aspect of it i have to say is the one that i find it most
*  difficult to get my head around because the other stuff is really worrying and scary but i sort of
*  know inferiorly is what to do in response right so you know the fact that money plays far too big a
*  role in our politics um look that's terrible and given that the supreme court is likely to be
*  dominated by people who don't see that as a problem for foreseeable future it is in practice hard to
*  know how to fight it but in theory i sort of know what to do right we need much more robust campaign
*  finance regulations make it harder for people you know to go from congress to wall street and so on
*  so forth right so i sort of know what the solutions are even though i struggle to
*  to imagine a path that which we would implement on this other end it is it is harder because
*  i really do think that two values are in conflict with each other here and one of those values is
*  responding to popular will and having a sense that there's real democratic accountability
*  and the other is actually achieving the expertise in the coordination we need in order to solve very
*  real problems so people are going to be pissed off if we don't solve so let's take you know the topic
*  of climate change um you know in order to deal with climate change adequately um we need to have
*  you know nearly 200 countries around the world coordinating if united states does a lot of effort
*  to reduce its carbon emissions that you know russia and china don't at all which is not going to be
*  able to deal with a problem but how on earth are we going to structure a decision-making process in
*  which we coordinate the actions of 200 countries and yet ordinary citizens feel like yeah you know
*  what i already had a say in this that's going to be incredibly hard yeah and the time scale for
*  human beings to care about what happens in the world is not much longer than a human generation
*  or a human lifetime so that's that's going to be a very difficult problem in the best of times
*  um but then we also have in addition to technology and globalization and connectivity and complexity
*  we also do have the questions of uh diversity and immigration and so forth and they're clearly these
*  play a role you know in the aftermath of trump's election there was a debate is it are people
*  voting for him because of economic anxiety or because of racism or nativism and clearly they
*  both play some kind of role but you had a line in your book which i thought was very
*  provocative uh you say neither in north america nor in western europe has there ever been a truly
*  equal multi-ethnic democracy so what we're trying to create right now is a historically unique
*  experiment is it plausible even if slightly depressing to think that one of the reasons why
*  democracy has been relatively successful over the past couple centuries is because
*  it's been kind of a very special kind of democracy where there was always one group that was in
*  charge and therefore didn't feel threatened and the attempt to really be democratic not only among
*  people but among different kinds of people in different groups is much less stable and harder
*  to maintain that's a fear i mean one of the striking things about uh political history you
*  know well beyond but well before the the prime of a democratic age is that those states that were
*  reasonably democratic tended to be more homogeneous that when you think of you know the examples of
*  a friday multiethnic state or city before say you know 1900 you might think of vienna in the 19th
*  century you might think of istanbul or baghdad at various points in the middle ages you might think
*  of rome in the second or third century but those were usually when these places either
*  went democratic or at least where minorities didn't really have voting rights and in a way
*  that's obvious when you think about it because it's easier for me to tolerate somebody who might have
*  a slightly different culture from me a different religion who perhaps if it is has a different
*  ethnic origin if i don't feel like they have a voice over my political fate no i don't have
*  any power he doesn't have any power all the decisions are made by the monarch anyway so all
*  right right once um i look at people who are quite different from me and say oh these people actually
*  can go and vote and affect what happens to me uh it becomes harder um so so that's one historical
*  worry that i have and then you see um how deep resentment is especially in this increasing good
*  social science on this of people who used to be dominant and are now threatened with dominance
*  um and you know in in europe uh the idea of what it was to be italian or french or german was
*  always pretty deeply mono-ethnic and monocultural there was somebody who's descended from a particular
*  ethnic stock um and so suddenly these societies are asked to say oh hey you know what somebody who
*  comes from other parts of the world even if they're born here but their parents that um they can be
*  a member of our society too and there's real resistance against that and the states and in
*  canada there's always been a multi-ethnic society but there's been one as you point out with a very
*  deep racial religious hierarchy in which members of a particular group had big advantages over
*  others and so again um uh you know the people who are uh having some of those unearned privileges
*  taken away uh are going to be quite resentful about that now i don't condone that um i have
*  a right to those privileges but i think it's actually important to take a moment to try and
*  understand uh sort of where that sentiment comes from and i always picture sort of you know somebody
*  who's not perhaps especially talented not especially good-looking uh not especially affluent um and you
*  know in italy in 1970 they might have said you know what um i get the most social respect and
*  all of that but at least i'm italian rather than albanian and at least i'm part of a majority
*  population rather than one of those moroccan immigrants well now suddenly um you know the kid
*  of those albanian immigrants might be making more money than you he might be your boss he might be
*  representing in parliament and i celebrate that as as as political progress um but it isn't too
*  surprising that people who have that status advantage taking away from them you can no longer
*  say hey just by virtue of being a member of this group i have a certain kind of social status but
*  superior but they're gonna be resentful uh for having that taken away from them there there was
*  a sociologist uh who did a study that i that i read back you know a couple years ago but i'm i'll
*  have to look her up i forget her name but you know it was one of these things she was ahead of the
*  curve in terms of asking the question what do the trump voters really want and she uh embedded
*  herself she was a berkeley leftist progressive let's just she went to like you know i think
*  of a hulk child oh probably yes exactly and uh just talked to people and sort of you know lived
*  their lives and and got to know where they were and she came up with this metaphor and she then
*  read the metaphor back to them and they said yes that's exactly it and the metaphor was
*  you know you think of yourself as you know standing in line in in the race to life you know and there's
*  better times ahead and you're walking toward them slowly you're doing your work and it's effort but
*  you're making progress and then you see off to the side you know a whole bunch of new people
*  skipping the line just being you know elevated in front of you not waiting their turn and this
*  feels unfair to you and these are you know immigrants or minorities or gays or lesbians
*  or whatever or even women for that matter and people said yes that's more or less how they feel
*  even if it's not really an accurate representation so i mean i i want to you know give value to that
*  feeling like how can we give people back the feeling that they are in charge of their destiny
*  this must have at least some uh role to be played by inequality and the fact that you know more and
*  more wealth is going to the wealthier but still on a broader scale we need to be able to make
*  people think that this is this is their country they can get ahead uh it's their country as well
*  as other people's countries and that's a good thing rather than a bad thing i'm not quite sure
*  how to get there in any simple way yeah and here again i mean you know the striking thing is that
*  we've never quite done that so so we should be uh prepared for for for some pain um but what you're
*  describing is exactly right we need to figure out how we can uh defend uh minority groups against
*  frankly the quite obvious attacks with the suffering at the moment um and more broadly
*  the disadvantages uh that that they have suffered for a longer time um and at the same time we need
*  to make sure that uh the majority group isn't assured of having special privileges i don't
*  think we can just assure that um but that they feel like you know they are still going to
*  get to the front of the line at some point as well right that the goals that they have
*  the inspiration to have are going to be fulfilled and they don't see those as being threatened
*  um by those broader cultural and demographic changes um and and doing both of those things
*  at the same time uh is is incredibly hard but but our ability to win the kind of society we want is
*  dependent on that and and i want to add something here which is important which is that i think
*  sometimes i hear a lot of impatience with that question uh from people who perhaps are members
*  of minority groups or just more broadly from from the left um and i get that right because
*  you know here we are we're already suffering from historical discrimination we're being attacked
*  right now and we're supposed to worry about the feelings of those people who have it better than
*  us anyway i mean i absolutely get that reaction um but i do think that there's a slight contradiction
*  in how uh we sometimes think about that which is that i hear the same people say
*  you know we live in a society in which uh racism and white supremacy and structural injustice goes
*  incredibly deep and you know the majority group has these incredible reserves of power and influence
*  and so on and at the same time we should not give an inch to them we should be absolutely uncompromising
*  um and and i'm not quite sure how we reconcile those two things because if you really think the
*  majority group has such deep power and influence then in order to affect any kind of change you
*  need to make your case to them to some extent right yeah you need then if you if you don't have
*  any some of them on board then you're just going to lose every time right and so i think that the
*  most helpful way of doing this is to actually uh uh appeal to the better instincts of perhaps not
*  every single member of a majority group but but the bulk of the majority group and this is by the
*  way what the civil rights movement did it's in many ways what barack obama did um and it can be
*  effective and i'm sure it's frustrating i'm sure it sometimes means that we can't be quite as blunt
*  at least in in certain parts of politics as we would like to be um not give vent to our justified
*  anger you know quite as freely as as we would like but but if you actually care about making
*  this country better and winning those political victories um i fear that it's necessary to some
*  extent yeah and i feel you know it's easy for me to give advice to people who are members of
*  historically discriminated against groups since almost none of the groups that i'm in uh have
*  faced that but i also think it's important to distinguish between groups and individuals
*  right and i think the fact that there is white privilege and male privilege and cisgender
*  privilege etc i think these are very real things those don't mean that even if you're a member of
*  all those groups your life was easy or you haven't struggled i think that there are real struggles
*  that people go through no matter what groups uh they're members of in some sense everyone
*  struggles but there are some you know poor people or people who uh economics and and politics have
*  left behind in a very real way and there's nothing wrong with taking their concerns seriously it's
*  kind of crucially important to the bigger democratic project well and right and i think
*  there's a real problem of distribution here right which is to say that obviously um uh you know
*  on average members of of historically discriminated groups by virtue of being
*  members of historical discriminated groups um have faced many more obstacles and many more
*  struggles than than the members of majority groups um and that is a deep injustice that as a society
*  we need to reconcile uh but obviously the kinds of people who end up being the spokespeople
*  for that position also aren't the specs people by coincidence there's so many people because
*  they have had most success in life and perhaps also had some advantages relative to other members of
*  their own group and so you often end up with a dynamic in which people who actually personally
*  have also discriminate experienced real discrimination and so on that have gone to
*  some of the best colleges in the country make six-figure salaries and so on sort of uh you know sit
*  there explaining um why it is that that most perhaps all members of a dominant group um have
*  these huge privileges and you end up people you know with people who who haven't had a great
*  education who perhaps have had real uh personal tragedies happening to them who perhaps have had
*  abusive parents or um uh come from households that are deeply dysfunctional so listening to this and
*  say oh you you know professor so-and-so or fellow at so-and-so institution or you know columnist at
*  so-and-so newspaper or magazine are explaining to me why it is that you're you know so disadvantaged
*  and and and uh and that's a real problem with dynamic right um which doesn't invalidate the
*  fact that of course there are those underlying structural injustices um but but but but i think
*  it means we need to be a little sensitive of how to communicate that in a way that people
*  uh are willing to to to have an open mind yeah and again i feel bad asking people who are members
*  of groups who have been discriminated against to be patient and understanding and empathetic to the
*  people who are members of groups who have been dominating them for hundreds of years but it's
*  also a good strategy long term i think i think there's a place for bomb throwing and you know
*  raising a ruckus there's also a place for sitting down and reasoning together and appreciating
*  appreciating each other's uh points of view becoming less and less common and by the way i
*  just want to i was want to emphasize two things a this is not a moral claim it's a strategic claim
*  right um it's just a claim about what to do in order to ensure that people like donald trump
*  aren't in a position to do tremendous damage and violence uh to those groups um and b i think you
*  know we would do well not to talk about you know how much of a ruckus should you raise and
*  and how large should you be about that i think to me it's about the manner in which we talk about
*  it not how much we talk about it or how passionately we talk about it which is to say that at a moment
*  in which minorities aren't a very real attack there's no limit to how much we should talk about
*  i just think that the strategically productive way of talking about it is to actually say this
*  is the kind of society we want and here's where that society is one that should be appealing to
*  all americans and why despite the dark chapters in american history it actually calls on the best
*  traditions in american history and it calls on the ideals of the founding fathers even if the
*  founding fathers themselves were in many ways fraud and that's something that from you know
*  martin luther king to barack obama a lot of people in the history of our country have have
*  done incredibly successful so so that to me you know appears to be the way to actually make make
*  headway yeah and i'm going to choose to continue to be optimistic on balance uh about the force
*  of reason and community and uh appealing to the better angels of our nature uh however let me also
*  say that i read your book and it's very depressing there's there's real prospects of things going
*  badly um i don't want to be alarmist or i don't want to overreact uh is certainly in my mind very
*  possible that despite everything donald trump in the united states and other people in other
*  countries will be moments in history not uh precursors of an entirely new phase of history
*  but there's also another possibility that things go just disastrously wrong you know if you asked
*  what would it like what would it be like for a functioning healthy democratic liberal democracy
*  like the united states to turn into an authoritarian dictatorship maybe the precursors would look more
*  or less like what we're seeing so how how seriously should we be worried about a true collapse of
*  liberal democracy in a country like the united states uh well i think the you know there's a
*  way of interrupting a question purely about probabilities and a way of interpreting it about
*  you know expected values which is to say that you know i don't think that uh the likelihood of
*  liberal democracy collapsing the united states is over 50 is probably quite a bit lower than 50
*  but given how disastrous that outcome should be i think we should be very worried about it um five
*  i don't know it's hard to put a percentage around it but but you know the striking thing is that
*  five or ten years ago political scientists thought that um it was essentially impossible
*  that the likelihood was zero that once uh countries had changed this is your point from earlier had
*  changed governments for free and fair elections at least a couple of times once they had a gdp
*  per capita of more than you know about 14 000 in today's terms they were safe we really didn't
*  have to worry about them and we've already seen in countries like hungary that that's untrue
*  that you have uh authoritarian populace take over there and um uh in my mind destroy liberal
*  democracy for sure probably not even preserve illiberal democracy but erect a form of competitive
*  for tarnism um and now we're seeing uh the president of the united states take the first
*  steps that people like prudence and russia like erdogan and turkey that uh google shavis and
*  venezuela have taken a few years ago and because we are a richer country we're a country with a
*  more vibrant civil society a very deep constitutional tradition there's every hope that we're going to be
*  able to stop that but at step three or step four donald trump is not going to be able perhaps not
*  want to take step five and six and seven as well but certainly as a scholar of comparative politics
*  the pattern i'm seeing the direction we're going in is very concerning indeed yeah as a good
*  bayesian i feel it's my responsibility intellectually to actually assign probabilities to everything
*  that i think might happen but i take your point which is that we've definitely undergone a change
*  from thinking that that kind of disaster in the united states is simply inconceivable for all
*  practical purposes to at least thinking that it's conceivable and if it is rare and it doesn't happen
*  then you know there's a silver lining there that we take this more seriously and hopefully we can
*  fix things down the road the pessimism that i have about that is you know one of the many ways i was
*  wrong about politics over the last few years was i dramatically underestimated the extent to which
*  serious grown-up members of the republican party would resist the worst impulses of a trump-like
*  administration and i take it that that's also happening in other countries there are you know
*  you you join a group you do game theory what is best for my re-election chances that's just
*  way more important than what's best for the larger country and that's even more depressing
*  than the fact that one person or another wins an election to me yeah so a few thoughts here the
*  first is that you know as a political scientist i've always been quite skeptical of some of my
*  colleagues who took a rational choice approach to much of a political world and and in particular
*  to this case right where they said look i mean basically you can just think what maximizes
*  politicians chance of re-election and then from that very simple assumption you can derive most
*  of that behavior you know i don't quite buy that people are more complicated than that have some
*  of them more idealistic than that well i've become much more sympathetic to that approach
*  over the last couple of years i have to tell you um the the other thing is that you know i used
*  to be the most pessimistic person in the room i mean i'm a sort of democracy doom hipster right
*  i worried about democracy before it was cool and i used to be called a cassandra a lot of a time as
*  a result and and i always want to say to people but cassandra was right damn it read the story
*  um i didn't make me sound like much of a crank but um but but you know i was a pessimist in debates
*  about what would happen to the republican party once donald trump won the presidency
*  um you know i thought you know the optimists thought you know what these people have very
*  different beliefs from barack from from from donald trump and they have deep commitment
*  to constitutional values and so they're just going to rein him in i would know that's not true
*  the base is actually of trump at this point and then you know a couple of them might flip and
*  over time over time donald trump is going to succeed in replacing the party with his own base
*  he's going to have trump as candidates running the primary and there'll be a sort of republican
*  civil war for four or six or eight years but eventually it'll turn into a populist party
*  well it turns out speaking of you know having updated probabilities um they were both wrong
*  but what happened is much more extreme than what i predicted and that's that republicans just flipped
*  they said you know what trump is so popular this is clearly where we're at now even though for many
*  years i um talked about values that um you know are very very different i'm just going to go with
*  this now and so much more quickly much more thoroughly than pessimists like me had predicted
*  donald trump has wound up being in control of the republican party and as basians i think
*  we should therefore also update our probability of similar shifts happening in other institutions
*  i'm much more worried now when i was six or seven months ago about the supreme court um
*  acquiescing with extreme behavior by donald trump
*  um yeah and the evidence is there right so we collect more data we update our priors and
*  that's not the uh it's not good news for optimism but there's still there's still some remaining
*  uh let me just play the devil's advocate here um part of the pessimism that i have is that i know
*  um you know some pretty smart people in academia and elsewhere um who are saying you know like
*  sure donald trump is not you know going to win any iq tests but if we look worldwide if we look
*  not just at um europe but if you look at china or russia isn't it possible that there's a sense in
*  which a strong even a strong man government gets more done i mean especially looking at china there
*  are people who who say you know well sure it's not a democracy human rights are not good but boy
*  they can really build bridges really really well isn't there a trade-off there that we might think
*  about buying into and what do you say to that argument well a few things i mean first of all
*  view of retirement systems that work very well actually very limited in number um in china
*  does work reasonably well economically for now um there's a real question about whether it can
*  transition from being a mid-income economy to a high-income economy but it's very difficult to
*  emulate china i like to quip that you know china works very well in practice but it's a mess in
*  theory um you know it has a very unique history um but unless you happen to have the communist
*  party kicking around that's been around for 60 years and still sort of claims to be maoist but
*  actually a state capitalist it's very difficult to know how you would even go about emulating
*  so let's look at the countries which do actually resemble uh donald trump let's look at the countries
*  in which our four town populace have taken over countries like venezuela countries like turkey
*  and russia and hungary and they're not doing particularly well economically right they are
*  deeply corrupt rossip erdogan just made his son-in-law the new finance minister
*  um that would never happen here that's okay unimaginable do we even know who trump's son-in-law
*  is never heard of the guy yeah behind the scenes and this is by the way something when i talk to
*  members of a business community try to emphasize to them i mean you've already seen companies like
*  at&t essentially bribes to michael cohen uh trump's personal lawyer um you have seen um attacks on
*  american companies for their business decisions they took uh like harley davidson threatening
*  tax retaliation and so on rule of law is one of the reasons why the american economy has worked
*  incredibly well you don't want a situation in which your success as a businessman depends on
*  whether or not you're in favor with the regime and that's not an abstract thought that is how
*  business runs in many countries in the world and those countries tend to have much lower growth
*  rates okay good this is this has been great um to close i will uh play the role of the genie coming
*  out of the bottle and i would give you one wish but i'm only going to give you a menu you don't
*  get to make up your wish and you're good yeah exactly it's a multiple choice uh genie and so
*  here are your choices with the goal in mind of you know some combination of making the country
*  more pluralistic and liberal democracies successful so one option is you could
*  radically improve our educational system secondary and primary you could really inculcate values you
*  could you know teach kids that diversity is important and the constitution is important
*  and rule of law is important democracy and all that stuff that's one option another is you could
*  really impose policies that would help fight inequality you know redistribute some of the
*  wealth not by you know necessarily socializing everything but just a real tax code that took
*  capital gains and wealth into account and really helped people maybe a basic income or something
*  like that that is uh the second option and the third option is we could make sure i don't know
*  how this would happen but we could make sure the media actually told the truth we could have you
*  know different voices in the media but make sure that there was not any sort of state quasi state
*  sponsored uh propaganda machine that gave people the news that they thought that they should be
*  hearing so those are your three choices which one of those would you think is the most important
*  i'm i'm going to be very annoying here and give a sort of literalist natural scientist perhaps even
*  if i may be so bold answer i mean i think a lot of the things you're describing are different parts
*  of net equilibrium and it's very hard to change one of those who are changing the other um so i
*  think if you had much more economic equality you also would have a much better education system
*  right um and if people were better educated then they would also uh you know uh be less likely to
*  watch fox news um and so you know i think that that
*  these things go together or fall together also there's no such thing as genies so you could have
*  said that that would have been an adequate naturally scientific god damn i missed the
*  opportunity that would have been the easy way out all right yasha thanks so much even if it's not
*  uh always um making us more optimistic i think it is important to understand what's going on
*  that's what really gives me optimism that there are people like you that are really taking these
*  things seriously looking at them as carefully and rationally as we can and trying to find a good
*  way forward and and there are if i'm allowed a closing word there's things that people can do
*  i'm the people who are listening to this podcast you can you know if you have an answer to shon's
*  excellent question about you know whether it's a boc then go and work at that if you think it's a
*  go and work at improving the education system if it's b then go and uh fight for more income
*  equality if you think it's c then go and found your own media company or uh do whatever it takes but
*  but you know i i am worried about the future but i'm not fatalistic because i do think it's subject
*  to human agency and i like the citizens of of of china and north korea and and turkey and russia
*  we still have the liberty to go and fight for our local values so that's what our job is now
*  good you you correctly perceive the subtext of the question
*  oh great all right yasha monk thank you so much for being on the podcast thank you this is great
*  fun thanks
*  you
