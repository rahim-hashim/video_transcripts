It’s a big universe we live in, so it comes as no surprise that big numbers are needed to describe it. There are roughly 1022 stars in the observable universe, and about 1088 particles altogether. But these numbers are nothing compared to some of the truly ginormous quantities that mathematicians have found to talk about, with inscrutable names like Graham’s Number and TREE(3). Could such immense numbers have any meaningful relationship with the physical world? In his recent book Fantastic Numbers and Where to Find Them, theoretical physicist Antonio Padilla explores both our actual universe and the abstract world of immense numbers, and finds surprising connections between them.

Antonio (Tony) Padilla received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Durham. He is currently a Royal Society Research Fellow in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nottingham. He is a frequent contributor to the YouTube series Sixty Symbols and Numberphile.

# Mindscape 214 | Antonio Padilla on Large Numbers and the Scope of the Universe
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9JHaSc_rSo)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll.
*  Sometimes when talking about cosmology, I will remind people that our universe,
*  which is about 14 billion years old, or roughly, order of magnitude, 10 to the 10 years old, right,
*  which sounds pretty old, is nevertheless pretty young in some sense.
*  Our universe is just a baby compared to how old it will be.
*  Of course, we don't know exactly how old the universe will get,
*  but according to the leading cosmological models that we have right now,
*  the universe will get infinitely old. There's no reason for it to ever end.
*  And anyway, it will use up its fuel in some finite amount of time.
*  The sun's shining, the stars are shining, galaxies are shining, but this shining won't go on forever.
*  Stars are going to burn up their fuel in about 10 to the 15 years,
*  so that's 100,000 times the current age of the universe.
*  And then the last black hole will evaporate away, we think, roughly speaking,
*  about 10 to the 100 years from now. In other words, about a Google years from now,
*  in the original notion of the word Google before the search engine took it over.
*  The idea of a number, 10 to the 100, was actually invented sort of almost as a joke,
*  just as to stand in for a really big number you would never actually think to use.
*  Today's guest, Antonio Padilla, Tony Padilla, as he's known, thinks otherwise,
*  and he's written a wonderful new book called Fantastic Numbers and Where to Find Them,
*  a Cosmic Quest from Zero to Infinity, where he talks about these big numbers,
*  Google and of course its cousin the Googleplex, which is 10 to the power of a Google,
*  but then even way bigger numbers than that. Number theorists, mathematicians,
*  theoretical computer scientists have devised clever ways to represent these ginormously big numbers,
*  much bigger than you can really wrap your head around in a very real sense,
*  as Tony will point out as we talk. But what I really like about it is that Tony's day job is as a cosmologist.
*  He's a theoretical cosmologist, writes similar papers to papers that I've written.
*  He thinks about the cosmological constant and the cosmic microwave background and dark matter and dark energy
*  and so he finds ways to relate these ginormously big numbers to the physical world.
*  You might think that some of these numbers are just so big they have no possible physical relevance
*  and then as soon as you say that someone is going to find out a way to bring them down into physical relevance.
*  And so, which raises by the way some interesting philosophical questions.
*  Are these numbers even real? If you could find a number that is so big that it is impossible to contemplate
*  any physical relevance of it, then is that even a potentially real thing?
*  Is that something we should include in our set of numbers? That gets too philosophical.
*  We're not going to talk about that stuff that much. But the point is the very existence of big numbers
*  is not only useful to physicists but stretches our brains in thinking about them in fun ways.
*  And so this is going to be a fun conversation about exactly that. Let's go.
*  Tony Padilla, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Hi Sean, how are you doing?
*  I'm doing alright. You've written a wonderful book and we'll be talking about stuff in the book
*  and it's about big numbers. But you're a physicist, you're not a mathematician.
*  You and I are very similar in the papers we've written over the years.
*  There's a lot of overlap there. We've cited each other.
*  But you use the big numbers of math as a way of talking about the universe, which I think is great.
*  And so to get there, let's start with some numbers that the person on the street might think are big,
*  but the professional mathematician or cosmologist would scoff at. Like 10 to the 10, that's a pretty big number.
*  What does that mean? How do we think about exponentials and other ways of making bigger numbers?
*  Yeah, so when you think of something like 10 to the 10, obviously that's 10 multiplied by itself 10 times.
*  So it's a 1 followed by 10 zeros. So you see that and it clearly looks like a huge number.
*  But that's kind of quite this idea of repeated multiplication giving you exponentiation.
*  It's just the first in a whole chain of ideas that you can build in mathematics.
*  And it's really just the seed for something that can grow much larger and therefore can grow much bigger numbers.
*  Well, the famous one, of course, is the Google and then the Googleplex.
*  And there's fun stories about how that came to be.
*  Yeah, so of course, Google, which obviously most people associate with the search engine,
*  it's spelled differently when we talk about a number. It's G-O-O-G-O-L, right, of course.
*  But what is a Google? It goes back to Edward Kasner, who I think those of us who work in cosmology will know from,
*  he has a space time named after him, right, which people have used to think about the early universe and that sort of stuff.
*  But what Kasner was actually doing was Kasner was thinking about he was writing a popular science book, which we've both done.
*  And he was trying to really convey the ideas about infinity and really how any finite number, no matter how big it might seem to us in our sort of day to day lives,
*  is actually negligible, essentially zero compared to the infinite.
*  So he just sort of came up with a big number. Well, what's a big number? A one followed by never mind 10 zeros that you talked about, but 100 zeros, right.
*  So one followed by 100 zeros. Now, no one's going to deny that's a big number, right, by any earthly measure that we use.
*  And yet, and he wanted a name for this number. So he consulted his nephew, who was nine years old at the time.
*  His name was Milton Sirota. And he said, well, can you come up with a name for this big number? And Milton said, well, at Google.
*  So it came from his nephew. But then the story didn't stop there, because, of course, Kasner wanted to go bigger and still talk about how even bigger numbers
*  were sort of small compared to the infinite. And so he came up with a new number, which was a Googleplex, which is supposed to be loads bigger than a Google, right.
*  Right. And he asked his nephew, Milton, what would be a good definition for this?
*  So Milton said, well, it should be a one followed by zeros until you get tired.
*  Which I think for somebody like Kasner and any mathematician, that's a little imprecise.
*  So he didn't go with that definition. Yeah. Yeah. So he went with a more rigorous one.
*  So whereas a Google is a one followed by 100 zeros, a Googleplex is a one followed by a Google zero.
*  So it's a whole new level of size that you're talking about. And this sort of develops an idea of recursion in maths, which is really powerful.
*  So from a Googleplex, you can go to what some people call a Google duplex, which is a one followed by a Googleplex zeros.
*  And then you can go to a Google triplex, which is a one followed by a Google duplex.
*  And you can see every time you do this, you're going bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
*  And that's the power of maths. Yeah.
*  I mean, that that recursion is like basically the secret, right?
*  Like you make a big number by some process and then you do the process again and the number becomes way, way bigger than you started.
*  Yeah. Recursion repetition.
*  That's what really gives you the calculational power to grow numbers really, really quickly.
*  And yet the beauty of it.
*  And maybe it's useful to ground us in the real world a little bit.
*  I mean, we live in a world that is pretty big, like, you know, there's eight billion people on Earth almost.
*  Right. And but the professional cosmologist deals with even bigger numbers, the number of galaxies or stars in the universe.
*  But there are none of them are that big compared to with Google.
*  Why don't you give us some of like the size and scale of the universe and compare it to these big numbers?
*  Yeah. I mean, I suppose if you think about the universe and various things, numbers you can pluck out as things like, you know,
*  how big is the universe? How does it size to the sort of the cosmological horizon, which is as far as we can see?
*  Well, that's about 10 to the 26 meters.
*  So that's one followed by 26 zeros.
*  So that's the distance in meters to the cosmological horizon, which is what we normally think of as our universe.
*  Other numbers, big numbers that you can think about in the context of the universe.
*  Well, it probably doesn't really get any bigger than the number of particles that exist in the universe.
*  Yeah. Right. And that's 10 to the 80, which is, you know, one followed by 80 zeros.
*  And that's already way smaller than a than a Google.
*  Right. So Google's one followed by 100 zeros and 10 to the 80s, you know, it's 20 orders of magnitude smaller.
*  So one of the things I talk about in the book is what what could you do if you were a Google Air, if you had a Google Pounds?
*  Right. You could literally buy every particle in the universe, you know, really inflated rates and still have plenty of money left.
*  Now, I might actually be misremembering this, but I thought it was 10 to the 88 particles if we're counting photons and neutrinos and so forth.
*  Yeah. OK. That's the that's right. I mean, the typical estimate, you just go on baryonic parts.
*  So like the 10 to the 80 protons and neutrons and stuff like that.
*  Perfectly fair. But, you know, I I know I have listeners.
*  They're going to write in. This is good. I know the feeling.
*  And so what that makes you think.
*  Let's also get on the table of Avogadro's number or like some number dealing with biology somehow just to make sure that the biologists don't have bigger numbers than the cosmologists do.
*  Oh, well, now you're testing me, Sean, because I stopped doing biology when I was about 13.
*  So Avogadro, is that the one that's 10 to the 23?
*  It is. You got it right. And believe me, I live in fear of people asking me that too.
*  But I had to recently looked it up. So, yes, 6 times 10 to the 23.
*  Right. Yeah, exactly. And that's the number.
*  The number of particles in a molecule of gas or something like that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  See, this is really me digging back my old high school education.
*  British education is fair enough.
*  Yeah, it's not something I've been working with in my day job, to be honest.
*  But yeah, of course, the number of particles in a molecule of gas, which is a huge number.
*  But what I think that number really demonstrates to us is there is actually huge numbers lurking right beneath our nose.
*  And it's basically because of the hierarchy of scales that we see in nature.
*  So on the one hand, we've got the scale of us, roughly a typical human who's around between a meter and two meters tall.
*  And that's a typical scale of our size.
*  But then you compare it to the sort of subatomic world and all that and even all molecules and particles and all that.
*  That's such a much smaller scale.
*  And that's why you can get big numbers like Avogadro's constant just coming out of quite mundane things.
*  It's really the difference between particles and the world that we live in.
*  And if the universe around us only has 10 to the 88th particles in it.
*  And so typical macroscopic human scale things have Avogadro's number of particles in them.
*  Isn't there like the naive guess would be you never need a number as big as a Google and 10 to the 100 is bigger than all of those numbers?
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that's an interesting way of looking at it.
*  But like I said, depends what you define to be our universe.
*  I mean, so on the one, I mean, this is the one thing I always wanted to do with these numbers.
*  So these numbers, they are in some sense beyond our universe.
*  Right. And so what I try to do in the book is drag them into our universe to try to get some sort of physical personality from them, which is it's not easily done because you're absolutely right.
*  They don't have a natural place in there.
*  But when you try to bring them in and you can really reveal some quite remarkable physics and remarkable ideas of physics, that's that's the idea.
*  I mean, it's always been the case for me that numbers.
*  I mean, I started studying math at university and, you know, for me, there is there is a beauty in numbers and there's an elegance in numbers.
*  But but I've always needed a little bit more.
*  And what I've needed is that little bit of personality and that personality, I think, comes from physics and bringing the physics bringing the physics into the game.
*  So you're absolutely right. How do you drag a number like a Google or even a Googleplex into the physical world?
*  Well, you have to go a little bit beyond our universe or what we normally talk about our universe.
*  You have to start to think about maybe the universe beyond the cosmological horizon, imagine a universe that maybe is much larger.
*  And then you can start to really start to play games with these these truly gargantuan numbers.
*  The difference between mathematics and physics as as occupations or pastimes is a fascinating one.
*  I do think that people who are neither one of those might think that they blur together.
*  Right. I mean, you're pushing around equations and you're trying to solve them.
*  But the but the motivations are really quite different.
*  Right. The things that get a mathematician really, really excited are very often not the things that get the physicists excited.
*  I think that's entirely true. I think sometimes we can we can get sort of fed up with the pedantry of our mathematician colleagues.
*  Right. It's like, you know, this is this, you know, like, why are you worrying about this detail?
*  It doesn't matter. It's not going to change the physics. Right.
*  Because, you know, we have this idea of decoupling in physics that we don't worry about little tiny, you know, microscopic details.
*  They're not going to affect what's happening on macroscopic scales.
*  And so we don't need to worry about your little pedantry.
*  It's not important in the broader game scheme of things.
*  And I think that's probably where mathematicians and physicists differ in their approach.
*  And it was always I mean, I'll give you an example of what what really was that triggered my change in my attitude to this was was I was doing
*  it was shortly after I first went to the union.
*  I said I did a master degree and I had this proof to do and I wrote out the proof and I had all the arguments correct.
*  And there was no issue with it. But I got zero. I got zero for this proof.
*  And it was really frustrating. I was like, why have you given me zero?
*  And I thought, you know, what's going on here?
*  And the the the the Don at the time acknowledged that, you know, the proof is correct.
*  But he didn't like where I put the implication signs in the in the in the layout of the proof.
*  Right. They were all on one side of the paper and he goes, well, there's nothing on the other side of the paper.
*  And I was like, well, this is ridiculous.
*  Right. This is this is a level of pedantry, which which it's too much for me.
*  And I need more from my numbers. And that's where that's where I started to look towards physics.
*  I tell from reading about it in the book that this incident really scarred you for life.
*  You remember? It really did.
*  It really did. I mean, I kind of got it.
*  I mean, well, looking back, I kind of got it because, you know, you know, when you mark exam scripts and if things aren't laid out well, it can it can be really frustrating.
*  But wow, this this I thought was a pedantry too far.
*  But yeah, I mean, the way I think about it is if you have a billion examples of some mathematical construction and there's some property that is true for all but one of them, the mathematicians really, really care about the one where it's not true.
*  And the physicists only care about the others where it really is true.
*  Although at the same time, we do we do focus on the things about our universe when we think about the properties of our universe.
*  It's the things that don't make sense that we care about.
*  It's the things that don't add up that we care about.
*  All of all the wonderful things that are just, yeah, that's how it should be.
*  We're not going to worry about those details, but we're drawn towards the puzzles.
*  As is everybody, I guess.
*  So one of the things that the mathematicians do with with this attitude of being interested in the math for its own sake, rather than to describe physics, is they find ways either because they're interested in the math.
*  Either because that's what they want to do or because they stumble upon them in the process of their regular math.
*  Find ways to generate way bigger numbers than a Google or a Googleplex or a Google duplex, et cetera.
*  So why don't you tell us just some of your favorite gigantic numbers?
*  Because a lot of a lot of sort of philosophical aspects of what these numbers mean when you get right down to it.
*  Yeah. So do you want me to tell you a little bit about about how you generate these really big numbers?
*  Yeah.
*  OK, cool. So there's a really so when you really talk about big, big numbers like the kind of number like Graham's number, which is the largest number ever to appear in a mathematical proof for a long time.
*  When you're talking about numbers like that, you can't just use our conventional mathematical language that people learn in school to describe them.
*  They're just too big. They're just too big.
*  So you need to develop new ideas, right?
*  So one of the things you can do is you can develop this sort of as a Donald Knuth who believes in Stanford is a computer scientist over there.
*  He developed a new notation to sort of build very, very big numbers.
*  And it kind of uses again this idea of recursion and repetition.
*  So very simply. So if you think about really go back to sort of fundamental level and you think about what is you know, what is multiplication?
*  Well, when I say multiplication, I'm really doing repeated addition.
*  So three times four is three added to itself four times.
*  Right. That's what it is.
*  So, OK, so you've said you've gone from from sort of addition to multiplication using this idea of repetition and recursion.
*  Well, you can go now you can go one step up again.
*  You can say, well, what is repeated multiplication?
*  Well, we're still in a high school realm now.
*  We're talking about exponentiation.
*  So, you know, when you say what is three to the four?
*  Well, that's three to the power of four.
*  That's three times times by itself four times.
*  Right. So exponentiation is repeated multiplication.
*  Now, at high school level, you stop at that point.
*  That's enough. Right.
*  They don't. So they carry on.
*  And so instead of saying that three to the power of four is the sort of saying it like that, they say three arrow for.
*  OK, that's the notation they would use.
*  And then they go a step further.
*  And they say, well, sorry, just to me, because we can't see in the audio podcast.
*  This is like a little upward going arrow in this notation.
*  Right. Yeah, exactly.
*  So you have a little up with our.
*  So instead of saying three to the power of four, you say three up with our four.
*  Good. OK.
*  And so that just means the same thing.
*  Now you can go go a step further.
*  You've got repeated addition gives multiplication repeated multiplication gives exponentiation.
*  Well, what's repeated exponentiation?
*  OK, well, that's called tetration.
*  Right. And you can denote that with two arrows.
*  So you have now three, two arrows for that would mean three exponentiated four times.
*  So three to the three to the three to three like that.
*  And you can build like this.
*  And of course, once you've got double arrows, you can have triple arrows, which are repetitions of double arrows.
*  And you can have quadruple arrows, which are repetitions of triple arrows.
*  And you very quickly get very, very big numbers.
*  So, for example, let me give you an example.
*  So three to the power of three is twenty seven.
*  So three arrows, three is twenty seven.
*  What's three double arrows?
*  Three. Well, that's three to the power of twenty seven, which I think is about seven point six billion.
*  So already you get very big.
*  And now you do more and more of these repetitions and you get really, really huge numbers.
*  And this technique allows you to grow to very large numbers, as large as Graham's number.
*  And the rules of the game, I guess, are that we we have a finite number of symbols to work with.
*  Right. So we're trying to figure out ways to denote big numbers without just listing all the digits or whatever.
*  That's impractical. There are not enough atoms in the universe.
*  But we can compactly represent some of these giant numbers.
*  Exactly. We can ask.
*  So in the example we talked about, the not, you know, that each new arrow in this notation allows you to sort of grow things much more quickly.
*  But what you can then do is you can then start to sort of almost label the arrows themselves, the number of arrows themselves and grow the number of arrows in this hugely sort of powerful way.
*  And then you can keep doing that and keep doing these these tricks.
*  And again, it's compact. It's like you say, it's compactifying the notation that can allow you to sort of grow very quickly.
*  And then you always put a little label on it. And then that label, then there's some idea of what you do at the next step.
*  What do you do when you do the repetition? And then and then you can grow the labels. You can grow everything.
*  Mathematicians love having games with symbols and labels. And I know in some sense, getting the right notation is really what gives you the mathematical power.
*  And so what is Graham's number?
*  So Graham's number is this extremely large number that was that was it came about from the mathematician Ron Graham.
*  He used it in a mathematical proof. He was trying to solve a problem in a branch of mathematics known as Ramsey theory.
*  Now, Ramsey theory very loosely. It's the idea of finding sort of order from chaos.
*  So you have some sort of random assembly of things and you're trying to find some structure and cliques and some sort of order within that.
*  So, for example, if you think about the houses of parliament in the UK and you've got a whole sort of, you know, gossiping bunches, shouting, and it seems very chaotic and everybody seems to be disagreeing.
*  And it's just it's chaos. But you might ask, is there some order within that chaos? And you say, well, maybe there is.
*  Maybe there's a bunch of trade unionists that there's a clique of trade unionists there within that sort of seeming chaos.
*  There is agreement and order and kind of intuitively Ramsey theory is the is the study of that intuitively.
*  Now, what Ron Graham was doing, he was looking at a problem involving hypercubes, which are sort of generalizations of cubes to higher dimensions, you know, five, six, seven, eight, nine, whatever number dimensions you might be interested in.
*  And he was looking for a particular property of these cubes and he wanted to know how many dimensions did you have to have to guarantee that this particular mathematical property would exist, would always be guaranteed to hold.
*  And what he showed was, was that it's the number had to be, I think, bigger than six dimensions, but it had it.
*  It needed that the sort of upper limit was this Graham's number, which is this truly gargantuan number that you can't write in any conventional way.
*  You need this fancy mathematical tricks and notation to write it.
*  Now, for me, as a physicist, I did my usual thing where I like to think about, well, OK, this is all fine.
*  And it's all nice thinking about hypercubes and thinking about, you know, this number and some wonderful maths in there.
*  It's great and it's lovely. But but can I bring it into the physical world?
*  I said, well, most people, when they think about a number, they don't think of canals arrows or some fancy mathematical recursion tricks.
*  They don't think about that. You just think of it written out, right?
*  Using the standard way that we write out numbers in our decimal expansions that we use.
*  Right. That's what people do.
*  So I said, well, I suppose somebody thinks about Graham's number.
*  What would happen then if they tried to picture it in their head?
*  And I quickly realized that if you do that, then you have a bit of a problem because Graham's number is so large.
*  And what you must remember is that each digit in Graham's number contains a little bit of information.
*  OK, there's information stored in each one of those digits.
*  And so if you're going to picture Graham's number in your head, you're storing a hell of a lot of information in your head and information ways.
*  And if information ways, then every time you picture one of Graham's number did Graham's numbers digits, you're going to store some information in your head.
*  You're going to add some mass to your head.
*  Might only be a very microscopic amount, but it will be a little bit.
*  And when you've got the whole of Graham's number in there, well, you're basically trying to cram too much into your head.
*  And the inevitable outcome will be that your head would collapse into a black.
*  Has this ever happened?
*  I'm not aware of it ever happening.
*  Maybe it's one of those things we have to worry about, like, you know, the creating a black hole at the LHC.
*  So somebody's thinking about Graham's number.
*  So just to get this right, if someone just asked you, you know, how many digits in Graham's number?
*  Like, there's no known answer to that, right?
*  It's not just to say the number of digits would be some incredibly large number.
*  Yeah, it'd be a huge number.
*  So yeah, no, I don't think you could.
*  Is there a way to calculate it?
*  It's probably of order Graham's number.
*  This is ironically the answer.
*  So maybe the logarithms, probably the logarithms of Graham's number.
*  It doesn't help very much.
*  It's still enormously large.
*  Yeah, it'd be the logarithm of Graham's number.
*  But already, but you can calculate that the thing that you can calculate is how much information you can contain inside a space the size of a human head.
*  That's something you can calculate.
*  And the reason you know what the maximum amount of information you can contain inside space the size of a human head is because you know the thing that contains information the best.
*  And the thing that stores information the best in the universe is a black hole.
*  Nothing stores information better than black holes.
*  They're brilliant information stores.
*  And so you just ask yourself the question, how much information can I store in a black hole the size of a human head?
*  And it's way less than Graham's number.
*  Yeah.
*  So I have some deep philosophical questions about the existence of these numbers.
*  But I just want to get one more number on the table first, which is tree three.
*  I love this number.
*  You talk a little bit about it, but I don't think I'd ever heard.
*  I'd heard of Graham's number before, but not of tree three.
*  Yeah.
*  So tree three is it's so the way I talk about it in the book is I link it to this idea of the game of trees.
*  So this is very intuitively you have a game where you have seeds and you have branches and you build trees.
*  Right.
*  And there are various rules to the games like you start off with a single seed and then you can start adding and then somebody writes down a picture of a tree with a single seed.
*  And then the next person writes down another tree with maybe branches and different seeds and so on.
*  And each time you start drawing these trees.
*  Now there's sort of this various rules.
*  But one of the rules is that if somebody writes down a tree which contains a sort of a bit of a tree that's gone before that the games over.
*  So what that mean?
*  What do I mean by that?
*  So let's suppose we're playing Sean and you draw one particular tree and then five goes later.
*  I draw a different tree and sort of set within my tree is a bit of something that looks a lot like your tree.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  Then I would lose.
*  OK.
*  So the question you can ask is is how long can this game last?
*  Right.
*  So how long could you keep going drawing trees without any previous tree being in it?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Is the game guaranteed to end for example?
*  Is it guaranteed to end?
*  And if so how long can it go on for?
*  These are the kind of questions you can ask.
*  Now it turns out the game is always guaranteed to end no matter how many different types of seeds you use.
*  Right.
*  So one of the things you can ask is is well how many how many suppose I have one type of seeds.
*  So let's say a black seed.
*  Right.
*  That's it.
*  Then that's all I've got.
*  Then I play the game and see how far I can go.
*  Now it turns out that game can only last one move.
*  OK.
*  Because as soon as I draw the black seed you've got to draw another tree and it's got to contain my black seed and game over.
*  There you go.
*  Yeah.
*  So that means that tree of one equals one.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  So now you play the game with two seeds.
*  I was going to ask.
*  Two different types of seeds.
*  So maybe a black and a white seed.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And OK.
*  Now you can play the same game again and you start writing down the things that you're allowed to do and it turns out the game cannot last beyond three moves.
*  OK.
*  That's the maximum.
*  There's no way the game is lasting beyond three moves.
*  OK.
*  So tree of two is three.
*  Equals three.
*  OK.
*  So the sequence so far is one comma three comma tree of three.
*  Exactly.
*  So now you play the game with three different types of seeds.
*  So let's say you've got a black seed a white seed and a red seed and you can make trees that are combinations of these seeds that have got branched the branches and all sorts of fun and games.
*  Right.
*  And again there are various rules about what you can lay down initially but you'd agree to those rules.
*  So we're playing this game now Sean.
*  Again you can ask how long can it go on for.
*  And you might think well OK well for one seed only lasted one get one one go for three for two seeds it lasted three goes.
*  So maybe it's got there maybe it's going to be like 10 goes for three seeds or 15 goes or something like that.
*  And it's not it goes bang it just literally goes off on one.
*  It's the most crazy sort of jump in a sequence you could ever imagine.
*  It goes to this number tree three which I mean we just talked about Graham's number which is which is too big to fit in your head.
*  Well I think tree three is too big to fit in the universe.
*  It's just a number which is it's beyond anything.
*  I mean it dwarfs these already gargantuan numbers.
*  It's an absolute monster.
*  And yet it comes from from this thinking about this game and and and and this you know there's lots of what one of the things it's used for actually one of the things that's useful for is the number three.
*  Is proof theory and understanding what you can prove what you can't prove within a mathmatic.
*  These kind of tree games are a good vehicle for that.
*  But it's interesting because tree three you can state what it is.
*  It is you know the largest number of games or what is exactly the definition largest number of moves that you could do.
*  It's the kind of maximum length of the of the of the game of trees with three different seeds.
*  Gotcha.
*  And I can say those words out loud but I can't in a down to earth sense calculate the number.
*  He doesn't fit into the universe.
*  Right.
*  No it really can't fit into the universe.
*  And this is this is the kind of thing that this is a game where he tried to bring physics into the game right and start to say well OK let's think about actually playing this game.
*  So you know me and you Sean we start playing this game right and we're going to play with three seeds and this is going to we're really good at this game.
*  So you know we make sure we don't get knocked out right.
*  And so we play this game we play this game we play as fast as we can.
*  Well how fast can we play it.
*  We certainly can't play a single go faster than a plank time right.
*  Because if we which is 10 to the minus 43 seconds if we do it faster than the plank time we break space time.
*  So we're not going to do that.
*  So that's as fast as we go.
*  We're going as fast as the face time will allow us.
*  Right. So we're doing like we're playing this frantic game of drawing trees drawing trees drawing trees drawing trees drawing trees.
*  Well you know we'd be old men long before this game was over.
*  OK so maybe we you know we're OK so we pass away and we replace ourselves with some fancy AI device which carries on playing the game like beyond our beyond our beyond beyond our sort of mortal lives.
*  This game is playing so there's AI Sean and there's AI Tony playing this game of trees and playing and playing and playing.
*  And they would carry on playing beyond the age of the solar system.
*  The sun would die.
*  So who knows what's powering this this this these AI devices.
*  But suppose they carried on maybe they're getting their energy off the cosmic microwave background.
*  I don't know.
*  So they carry on playing this game they carry on playing.
*  And they would go far beyond this sort of you know the heat death of the universe.
*  And they would go even beyond that.
*  And eventually the game would go on and on and on and on and on.
*  And then you'd say well but surely it's going to end at some point right.
*  And the problem is it never can because one of the things we know about the universe is that we think it's a finite system.
*  And in any finite system you get something called a Poincare recurrence which is where everything comes back to where it began.
*  So for example if you think about a pack of cards right.
*  So if you think about a pack of cards when you open a pack of cards you know you normally they're all laid out in the order of suits and it's really nice.
*  And then somebody starts shuffling it and they get messed up and so on and you play lots of games of cards and they get regularly messed up.
*  Well if you keep randomly shuffling the cards eventually and it's take a very long time but eventually you'll get back to the to all the cards lined up as they were when you bought them.
*  It will happen.
*  It will happen.
*  OK.
*  And it happens after this Poincare recurrence time.
*  And this is something that's true of any finite system.
*  And so if our universe is a finite system which we believe it is then that means that the universe will undergo a Poincare recurrence.
*  And the time it would take for that Poincare recurrence is not enough time for you to finish the game of trees.
*  So the universe would reset itself.
*  I'll put on the table that I'm not sure that the universe is a finite system.
*  I think it's an excellent question that we don't quite know the answer to but it at least is absolutely plausible that it is.
*  So I'll go that.
*  Yeah. I mean I guess I'm basing on the idea that we're sort of you know we're dominated by dark energy which in vacuum is going to dominate the universe for a long period.
*  And then yes I guess I'm basing on ideas that the things like the sitter thinking about the city universe and the amount of degrees of freedom associated.
*  Right.
*  I do want to talk about that.
*  I just want to point out that we don't know which is perfectly safe thing to say.
*  Very not.
*  But so I guess the question about these numbers like Graham's number in tree three is we can define them.
*  But do we really know what they are?
*  If we can't calculate them.
*  What does it mean to know what a number is?
*  What does it mean?
*  Oh right. Yeah.
*  What does it mean for it to sort of be meaningful?
*  I guess it's different to me what it is to be meaningful and what it is for us to know whether it exists or not.
*  I guess this comes back to the sort of the idea of whether any number exists right in some sense.
*  Well there's that.
*  Which is a whole new philosophical debate.
*  And you know there's these ideas that numbers only exist that they kind of exist outside the physical world and and or they're only there to describe the things that are in it.
*  So there's no such thing in some sense as an emancipated number.
*  There's only just the number that can describe the number of cups of tea I've got or the number of magic beans I have or whatever.
*  Right.
*  So but there's all these different ways about thinking about whether a number exists.
*  And I don't think there's any consensus within within philosophers about about that.
*  And I think that probably also applies to to to to big numbers as well.
*  I mean one of the things you can ask is is I did a video about this quite recently.
*  It's a bit of a controversial video but it was about what's the biggest number anybody's ever will ever think of.
*  Right.
*  So sorry. So you can ask yourself a question.
*  I think. Sorry I didn't say that right.
*  Well you could say what is that. What is the number.
*  How big a number do I have to get to find a number that nobody will ever think of.
*  So how big do I have to go.
*  Right.
*  So and the estimate I came up with is that if you think of a random assortment of a 73 digit number or so random assortments of digits.
*  Then chances are nobody in the history of humanity will will ever think of it's just some kind of silly trick with with you know sort of numerology a little bit and try to think about how many numbers an individual person would would think of.
*  And you think about Benford's law and the distribution of numbers and that sort of thing.
*  But you know I think it's true that certain numbers that are sort of maybe not Graham's number because we've thought about Graham's number it's been conceived.
*  But if you think of the numbers that are just in and around Graham's number that are maybe just out there.
*  No it's just somewhere around it doesn't matter right.
*  Yeah. No one's ever going to think of that number.
*  No one's ever going to have anything ever to do with that number.
*  Not even any person but probably no alien or anybody.
*  The universe will definitely something terrible is going to happen to the universe before before that number is ever conceived.
*  Yeah no and that's what it's a little bit humbling to think about this.
*  If you invent the rules of the game being that you have a finite alphabet of symbols to write things down with and a finite number of such symbols that you can put in your piece of paper book or whatever.
*  And these symbols are supposed to represent numbers as you get out there to bigger and bigger numbers of smaller and smaller fraction of all the numbers are representable even in principle right.
*  Like it's literally impossible to even even if you just stick to the integers.
*  It's literally impossible to denote all of these different numbers.
*  I'd say the flip side though is there is a flip side to this as well.
*  It is kind of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in our universe right.
*  So you're talking about mathematics which seemingly isn't in our universe right.
*  And one of the things I'm trying to do in the book is bring into our universe and you get all this extreme physics as a result.
*  But at the same time there's the question of we have our universe and yet maths has this uncanny ability to describe it.
*  And there's no reason why that should be true right.
*  It's kind of maths is a manmade thing right.
*  Maths is well maybe that's something we could debate but it feels like it's a manmade creation right.
*  And yet it's doing an amazing job about describing the universe.
*  I think that Vigna the great physicist Vigna has this lovely idea where he thinks about you know so you think about distribution of bread amongst people and how this will contain the number pi when you think distribution of bread in a random community.
*  It will contain the number pi and at the same time somebody could say well yeah that and what's that number pi.
*  Oh yeah that's something to do with the radius of a circle.
*  It's a difference in the radius of a circle.
*  Are you like well what's that got to do with the distribution of rather distribution of bread.
*  It's not got anything to do with it and yet the same number appears.
*  And I think this is what's and it's amazing that the universe is so mathematical and one can ask would it always be.
*  Is it guaranteed to always be mathematical or or is it mathematical to a point.
*  I mean it's it's done a massive done an amazing job of describing our universe but is that something we can rely on forever.
*  I don't know.
*  And one of the fun things you do in the book is you just a brick just to connect our previous discussion of cosmic numbers that are pretty darn big to these wild math numbers that are just hilariously big.
*  Let's make that the technical term hilariously big numbers.
*  But you it turns out that even though there's only 10 to the 88 particles in the universe you can still formulate sensible sounding physics questions that require us to think about numbers much bigger than that.
*  And the question that you dwell on a little bit is the doppelganger question.
*  So why don't you set that up for the audience.
*  Yes. So one of the things I wanted to think about was you know well I was really trying to sort of do this thing where I tried to make a big number like in this case a Googleplex try to think about it in a physical setting.
*  Yeah. And so you know we talked about how the universe reaches to 10 to the 26 meters to the cosmological horizon.
*  Now it's not that you get to that cosmological horizon and there's a big wall and you can't pass it right.
*  That's not how it goes right. You can. Who knows what's beyond the wall right. I mean maybe wildlings beyond the wall. Who knows right.
*  So the universe could in principle be much much larger. It's entirely possible.
*  And so I wanted to imagine well what if it was a Googleplex across in meters. It doesn't really matter whether you use meters inches fair longs whatever it's not going to make much difference.
*  So you imagine a really big universe which is which is this big a Googleplex across in say meters.
*  I thought what would be the consequences of such a universe.
*  And the kind of remarkable thing is that you realize that doppelgangers would be kind of an inevitability in such a universe.
*  And why is that. Well so very crudely you can think about the sort of a human being.
*  So let's take let's take you Sean and let's let's think about the volume of space that you occupy.
*  And you can think about the number of ways in which you can arrange sort of the if you speak quite cruelly about it we can imagine atoms ranging the atoms in that volume.
*  But if we're more sophisticated about it we'd say the number of quantum states that describe that volume of space.
*  How many are there. And these we expect that this is finite.
*  This is one of the things that we expect. And so if that's fine there's any finite number of ways of arranging that that volume of space.
*  So one of them would correspond to you. One would correspond to a cow. One would one would correspond to Donald Trump.
*  I'm sorry to say there's all these different possibilities that you could imagine right.
*  Empty space would be another one. And then but this finite number.
*  So assuming the laws of physics don't change if you go across the universe which is no reason to believe that they do then you know you can imagine sampling this the volume of space next to you and we say right.
*  Do we have another Sean here. No we don't. OK let's go to the next volume of space another Sean. No we don't find another Sean there and we keep going and we traverse across this magnificently large universe which is a Google Plex meters across.
*  And then we find out because the number of possibilities that could have described that original Sean size volume of space is finite and less than a Google Plex.
*  In fact a lot less than a Google Plex. You realize that if you go Google Plex across in the meters across in the universe then eventually you have to start seeing repetitions.
*  Now you might say that someone like you Sean is quite you know it's quite rare.
*  Very special.
*  Very special Sean.
*  You're very special.
*  Obviously you're quite an unusual state.
*  Obviously I would imagine empty space is by far the most common thing that you're going to find.
*  But so the probability of finding a Sean is very low.
*  But actually the difference between the number of possibilities and a Google Plex is so large that your chances of overwhelming those probabilities become it almost becomes implausible to think that you couldn't encounter the doppelganger.
*  Yeah and this is maybe even a little bit more specifically we look around our observable universe and we in the observable universe conditions are pretty similar right from place to place.
*  And so if that just extends infinitely far out or even super duper far out then the big there's only a fine number of things that can happen.
*  Everything's going to happen over and over again.
*  That's basically what it comes down to.
*  I think that's basically it.
*  Yeah.
*  And so what I was doing was putting a number on that really and so you estimate the typical distance to your doppelganger and it's I think the number I have is 10 to the 10 to the 68 meters is roughly the distance you might estimate.
*  Would it be weird for me to say that doesn't seem that far?
*  I would have guessed it was larger.
*  I mean it's pretty far Sean.
*  I think I don't think you're going to be going there on your holidays.
*  But the implication is also that every copy of that there's also every copy of me with every possible small variation.
*  Right.
*  Yes. Yes exactly.
*  So this is one of the things to talk about is one can ask the question well what is a copy of you.
*  Am I talking about something that's just something that looks like you or am I being much more precise than that.
*  Can I talk about you know something that looks like you and has the same thoughts.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know all the atoms are arranged the same way or you know all the neurons are firing in exactly the same way in your brain and I can really start to go right down to the quantum state and I can demand that it has exactly the same quantum state.
*  Now of course to actually show that I find you know a short I'm actually measure your quantum state exactly.
*  Well that wouldn't be very good for you Sean.
*  I would.
*  That would be not good at all.
*  That would destroy you.
*  Right.
*  I would have to measure the state of every single one of your atoms and that's not going to be that's not going to end well.
*  But at least in principle you can ask the question.
*  You know you have some particular quantum state which I don't know precisely and I would have to kill you to know it precisely but it's presumably there and there are only a finite number of possibilities till I find another one.
*  Well I think this is actually something that is worth getting into the weeds a little bit about because the subtleties matter here.
*  I mean if it weren't for quantum mechanics if it were classical mechanics right.
*  And I thought that I was made up of a set of electrons and protons and neutrons described by the laws of classical mechanics.
*  Then this kind of statement would be harder to make right because each particle is located somewhere in space and for just one particle in principle I need an infinite precision to locate where it is.
*  But quantum mechanics says something a little bit different right.
*  I think it allows you to just discretize in some sense it's kind of the quantum mechanics gives you gives you a fundamental unit which is measured in units of plant content of course in some sense and I think that's what quantum mechanics does give you that you know you can you can really break up phase space into it and into discrete building blocks in a way that you can't do with classical physics.
*  And just for just for the to be cosmologically correct we we don't actually know the universe is as big as 10 to the 10 to the 68 meters across.
*  It may be it might be we don't know.
*  No we don't. But you can ask you can ask by what process might it get so big and I guess one way it would do that would be you know this idea of eternal inflation for example in which you can have a universe.
*  So we have this this one of the things we think about our own universe is that very early times it grew very big very quickly.
*  Well there's no dispute that our universe has got quite big right.
*  And so how did it do that and there's this process called inflation where there's this field which pushes the universe apart very fast and it's known as the inflaton field.
*  Now, one of the questions that we have is is is how did that process start.
*  And that's a bit of a puzzle.
*  So one of the solutions to it is that you have this this inflaton field and what it does is it jumps about quantum mechanically from value to value.
*  And then at some point it hits this sweet spot where it has just the right value that it causes the universe to go crazy and push it push it pushes this around you know pushes the invest part very quickly.
*  So if that's the setup that you have, then there's absolutely no reason that in distant parts of the universe this inflaton field isn't doing its little quantum jumps and hopping around and then occasionally hitting a sweet spot and making that little pocket the universe it found itself in suddenly gargantuan.
*  And this can keep happening you just get this inflaton doing its little dance and then creating gargantuan universes every so often.
*  And if that keeps going and keeps going and keeps going, you could have and it's almost it's almost like a recursion within the universe right because you create a big universe and then you have jumps within that universe which create new big universes and then jumps within those
*  universes create those new big universes and this kind of the universe is doing its own recursion.
*  And so that's how it can get to quite you know very big numbers.
*  And so that would be the scenario in which you can imagine a universe this large I think but yeah, we don't know that the universe is that big, but we don't know that it isn't either.
*  Ben just because there's lots of different variations on this theme and I want to be clear about what the possibilities are.
*  We don't to make these statements about my or your doppelgangers appearing very far away.
*  None of this involves the multiverse as we usually think about it or the string theory landscape or anything like that.
*  It's just saying the universe is big and you just sketched a reason why that might be true but even without that reason it could just be the universe is big.
*  I think it's two things I think it's that the universe is big and it's the thing you alluded to earlier it's quantum mechanics at the end of the day.
*  I think that that makes those counting that you know how we count stuff finite in some sense it discretizes the world in which we live.
*  And there's a third thing which is actually one of my favorite things to think about.
*  So I'll highlight it which is the existence of gravity and black holes right because if it weren't for gravity then even in a finite region of space we could do an infinite number of different things in quantum field theory we can do an infinite
*  number of different things but gravity comes along and changes the game and I think this is this is going to matter for your calculations.
*  Yeah so certainly gravity sort of provides this cut off on the number of things that you can put in any finite space because eventually it comes back to you know if I want to sort of one of the things you can do is if you think about a volume of space you can count how many different sort of
*  bits of information can I hide in there how many different possibilities are there what and then again we talked again by how information weighs and you realize that if you put too much information you allow for too many sort of hidden possibilities then the only option is to form a black hole and black holes are the best
*  And black holes are the best hider of all the hidden possibilities that there is and gravity just kicks in and make sure that that happens and there's nothing you can do to avoid it and yeah that's the remarkable truth and indeed if gravity goes to if you don't have gravity as the gravitational coupling goes to zero these sort of limits that I'm putting on how much you can fit into one volume of space they go infinite.
*  It is absolutely true that the that the that the the limits on the the gravity plays a hugely important role in this.
*  And gravity also pushes us in the direction that you really put a lot of emphasis on in the book which is the holographic idea the idea that it's the way that we get these counting of how many things can happen in a region is not by separately adding up what can happen at each location right there there's some global constraints there
*  that make the world in some sense have less possibilities than you might have guessed.
*  It's really amazing when you think about it so it's a very naive even with gravity you might naively say how how do I count the number of ways I can I can build a Sean sized volume of space how many different possibilities are there.
*  I need to say well maybe I break up that space into the smallest volumes that I can imagine which are in the case of gravitational physics they are plank volume so 10 to the minus 35 meters across and I could say well maybe each of those different volumes has a certain number of possibilities it can states it can be in and then I just add them all up right.
*  But if you did that you would get a massive over counting and that's because what gravity actually does is it forbids loads of possibilities loads of possible combinations it just does and actually then that that would be the wrong calculation you do what it doesn't store its information in the interior of the space it seems in the way that I've just described there where you break the space up into lots of tiny little bits.
*  It seems to store on the edge of the space that's where the counting is done and so when you look at a Sean size volume of space you should really you want to make out how many possibilities there are you need to break up the surface that surrounds you into the tiny building blocks and calculate how many possibilities there are there.
*  But this is the I mean I think I think the holographic thing principle is I mean it started to develop around the time I was doing my PhD and I think it's mind blowing and fascinating and so profound in so many ways.
*  But yeah yes indeed indeed is this is using the holographic ideas that give you the sort of the better estimates for how many different possibilities there are.
*  I think that lurking in the back of my mind and your mind here is the idea of entropy but maybe we haven't connected that explicitly if you want to do that.
*  Yes yes yes I am talking about entropy right I talk about sort of saying information but really in some sense what I really mean is entropy well entropy and information are kind of one of the same thing.
*  So yeah so when I say that that's black holes are the best stores of information but I'm really saying there is that the best stores of entropy.
*  So you know what is entropy entropy is in some sense the number of different ways you can sort of have a you know sort of the number of different ways you can get the same macroscopic sort of object macroscopic observables you know from different possibilities.
*  So I take an egg so take a typical egg and I look at an egg it looks like an egg and it's got a given temperature it's got a given size got a given pressure.
*  It's the egg that I see right now what I don't know is where all its precise atoms and molecules are located.
*  It's not information I need it's not information I need to know temperature is not information I need to know it's an egg.
*  So all those all those little bits of information which are hidden in some sense they all contribute to the entropy because different possibilities could could give the same egg and the number of possibilities you count a number in other words a number of bits of hidden information.
*  So that's what I call what give you the entropy and when we talk about black holes as being the best stores of information what we're really saying is is there the objects which have the most entropy for their size.
*  Okay. And that's the thing that's really really we're really using here.
*  And they it goes as the area of the boundary and that's that was the beginning of holography.
*  Yes absolutely. So one of the most remarkable things about about black holes perhaps the most surprising thing from back in the day is that is that when you calculate the entropy of a black hole indeed it goes like the the the surface area of the of the event horizon.
*  So you know that's how it grows if I double if I want to double the amount of information stored in a black hole if I want to double its entropy I don't double the volume of the black hole I have to double its surface area.
*  And that's quite different to how you normally think of how you might grow information if I were to take a dinosaur which is not a very gravitational object.
*  Right. If I take a dinosaur if I want to double how much information stored inside it I would think about doubling the volume. That's probably what you would do.
*  But a dinosaur is is not a very gravitational object. It's not a deep black hole is right. And so with black holes the game is different it behaves differently.
*  And indeed you have to double the surface area to double double the amount of information it can contain. And then and that insight is what really led to this idea of holography that actually in some sense the the gravity when gravity is sometimes when you think about the gravity and three to say three dimensions of space it's in some sense connected to a theory in two dimensions which maybe lives on the boundary of that space.
*  But we I like how vague you were in that case right there because we don't actually know how to do that right. We don't know how to describe the real world in terms of a complete theory one dimension lower that might be something we're aspiring to.
*  I think so. So what we do have is we have so maybe we should describe what a holographic principle really is right. So these ideas about black holes and how they store information they've led to this this conjecture that on the one hand you can have a theory of gravity and let's say in say for example in three dimensions of space.
*  But you don't have to restrict yourself to three dimensions but just just to be concrete let's say we have a theory of gravity in three dimensions of space and that's one description of the physics.
*  But what the holographic conjecture would say is that is an entirely equivalent description of the same physics, which has no gravity.
*  There's no gravitational sort of you know you're not doing Einstein's equations or anything like that. You're just describing a theory without gravity but in one dimension less.
*  And but you describe exactly the same physics, exactly the same physical phenomena can be described in both languages. So in some sense it's like, you know, it's like when I just talk about a plate of meatballs.
*  I say if I'm English I'll say it's a plate of meatballs. If I'm Spanish I'll say it's albondigas. Right. They're still we're both describing the same same thing just using different language.
*  Yeah. Okay. So I think this is what the holographic principle really is. It's just saying you've got physical phenomena which you're going to use mathematics to describe.
*  Well which mathematics are you going to use? Okay I can use gravity with three dimensions of space or I can use just not bother with gravity and I just use this quantum field to describe it.
*  I can use quantum field theory in one dimension less and I can find a way to describe the physics using either language and I can get the same results and as long as I can have a dictionary that tells me how to go between the two and I can do this.
*  Now you're absolutely right Sean in saying that that does this apply to our universe. Well we don't know. What we do know is that there are examples of sort of if you like toy universes where this conjecture the evidence for is absolutely compelling.
*  And in particular you know this goes back to goes back to come out the center. There are examples of universes that are kind of five dimensional they're warped to just sit to spaces and there you can think about gravity or maybe more precisely string theory in these
*  universes and you can describe physical phenomena that might occur in those settings and then you can also show that there's an equivalent theory which describes the same physical phenomena which is given by what's called n equals four super young wheels that lives in one dimension less on the boundary of that space.
*  And so we have and we have we have these examples of where we can really show that you don't always need gravity you can always just do away with it and live on one dimension less.
*  And so the conjecture is is that true of our universe.
*  And it seems to this idea that that gravity is somehow wants to push you towards one less dimension. I think it's really something deep that may well be true of quantum gravity that you know when we really understand it better in the long run.
*  Right. But having said all that and the very nice version of the sales pitch for the holographic principle like you said that's not the universe that we live in the one where Malta Saina in anti decider space as we say imagine the world with a negative cosmological constant negative energy density and empty space.
*  But our world as you know as well as anyone has a positive energy density in empty space a positive cosmological constant and that's a both a fact that we need to face up to and also a little bit of a puzzle or maybe a clue depending on how you look at it.
*  Yeah I mean people have tried to think about these holographic ideas in it even in such a setting.
*  I absolutely agree then the ideas are not as robust and as clean as they are in an anti decider space and anti decider space seems to lend itself very naturally to holographic prescription in a way that the sitter doesn't.
*  But work is ongoing I think it's fair to say and people I mean there's I don't want to go into too much technical detail but I know Ava Silverstein for example a few years back was looking at these you know sort of lower dimensional examples and trying to push them into from ADS into the sitter with a certain deformation of the theory and coming up because I'm quite quite this is this TT bar stuff that they were playing with.
*  So there's some nice stuff there that's been done but I agree it's absolutely it's not something I'm in any way expert on and it's but I know there's people thinking about it.
*  But I mean maybe we can talk about what you are expert on which is the fact that our energy density in our universe does seem like a small positive number and this is confusing to us and we would like to try to figure this out.
*  It gets into the small numbers rather than the large numbers that we were talking about before.
*  Yeah so what you talk about in the book is that small numbers there's a whole section on small numbers and the idea there is that small numbers kind of betray the unexpected they tell you they signify a puzzle when a small number appears and tells you that something's probably not making sense.
*  And the big example of this is the cosmological constant.
*  So one of the things we see our universe right so we see that it's a very very large scales it's accelerating.
*  The universe seems to be pushing galaxies apart at an ever increasing rate.
*  And one thing you can ask is well what can cause this acceleration I mean gravity you normally think of it as an attractive force but but but so why would it why would it cause the universe to accelerate it would surely slow down the expansion of the universe.
*  But actually something can push the universe apart at an ever increasing rate and that's the energy of empty space itself the vacuum energy.
*  And you might say well how does the how does the universe how does the vacuum have an energy it's just empty space how could it possibly have energy well this is where quantum mechanics comes in and quantum mechanics tells you that the actual the vacuums are really exciting place.
*  It's not as boring as you think you can you know it really is this bubbling broth of virtual particles that not real particles but virtual particles that sort of pop in and out of existence and they can essentially endow the vacuum with an energy.
*  Now the problem arises when you try to calculate how much energy they give the universe and then you compare that to how much energy you think there needs to be to get the acceleration we see.
*  And what you find is is that the observed vacuum energy is a factor of 10 to the minus 120 of the theoretical expectation the amount that you calculate.
*  So it's a huge mismatch between what your calculation saying you should get and what we actually see the value that we see is far far smaller more than a Google times smaller than what our theoretical estimates are.
*  And the truth is if the if the universe really did have the huge vacuum energy that our theoretical calculations based on quantum field theory tell us it should have.
*  And well then it would have been crushed out of existence within within you know a moment of creation it would have the amount of vacuum energy would have just torn and twisted the listen to oblivion.
*  Do you know about Shannon's number have you ever heard of that one.
*  That's not what I know about gone so well I actually discovered it while sort of puttering around doing research for this podcast Claude Shannon of Shannon information theory fame asked you know how many different games of chess there would be.
*  Okay.
*  And I forget whether it was like total games or total strategies or something like that but he was not able to calculate it of course it's very hard number to calculate but he gave a lower limit and it turns out to be 10 to the 120.
*  Okay.
*  Wow.
*  Which is coincidentally the cosmological constant in plank units so I think that can't be a coincidence right maybe chess is revealing the secrets of the universe somehow.
*  Yeah now I'm starting to pitch the universe is a chess board.
*  That's all I mean right.
*  Yeah that's cool.
*  He was a little plank.
*  Each little boards are plank size across or something like that.
*  I don't know.
*  So yeah.
*  I mean it's a puzzle right.
*  Yeah that is and that is probably had nothing to do with chess with just just so everyone knows that we're just kidding around here but it's so the puzzle is that we have a guess as to how big the energy of the vacuum is.
*  The energy of the vacuum could be and we go observe it.
*  It's much much much smaller.
*  Do you personally have a favorite explanation for that.
*  Yeah I mean so it's something I thought about a lot over the years I mean of course I'm not gonna say it's my favorite explanation but probably the standard explanation is the anthropic one.
*  Which says that you know the universe is if it if the vacuum engines had been hadn't been tiny then you know we never would have had galaxies forming now the universe would have expanded too quickly early on the galaxies to form or it would have crunched into oblivion early on before galaxies form and if galaxies don't form and planets don't form then complex life doesn't evolve to sort of ask questions and record podcasts asking about about you know how big the vacuum energy of the universe is.
*  So that's the standard anthropic story.
*  Whilst that's fine I think you know it still behooves us to think about other ideas to try to understand where the cosmological constant is so small.
*  I think for me I noticed something you've worked on as well Sean is the is this idea that there's something very special about the cosmological constant which which makes it different to every other sort of source of energy and momentum in the universe and that's that it's constant.
*  It's kind of does what it says on the tin.
*  Everything outside this sort of you think about planets or a human being it's a localized source of energy momentum it drops off you know maybe both in time and space potentially.
*  And that's not true vacuum energy it at least it's a constant right it's it's sort of at least a baseline guy it's it's it's it's constant.
*  And so that's what sets it apart I think and so when we think about what we might do to address this this strange question about why we don't see this huge vacuum energy maybe we need to look at gravity on the scale that it's reacting to these constant sources.
*  Okay so we need to look so we think about is what this means is is that we need to look at gravity not on the local scale but on a global scale where we're really most sensitive to that constant source.
*  And so one of the things that I've worked on and I know you have to is try to think about global modifications of Einstein's theory.
*  So what that means is is that you're you're only changing the theory on the scale of the whole universe so it's only the supposed the longest wavelength modes of the theory that when the theory reaches out to the very very far distances that you start to see changes.
*  Right then really literally the furthest distances you can imagine any local physics like what happens in the solar system. Well that's got nothing to do vacuum energy anyway that's just the physics of the solar system that obeys the rules of the idea would be that
*  abase the rules of general relativity and does all the wonderful things general relativity does but if you what you could think about is modifying the theory on the global scale so really just for so it reacts to constant sources slightly differently.
*  And then what you can say is well it's fine let's say the vacuum energy is large. It's large it just is large but my theory of gravity reacts to constant sources slightly differently to how it does in general relativity.
*  And so I can somehow screen away this large large vacuum energy and just get the amounts of acceleration I see. Now it's a tricky game you've got to come up with a consistent theory that does this that's consistent with quantum mechanics and consistent relativity and all of that.
*  But that's something that we've been trying to develop in recent years through this sequestering proposal. Yeah and I think this I mean it's a great little insight for the people out there who don't do science for a living about how theoretical physics gets done.
*  You know you have some puzzle you're trying to understand then so you in words or pictures conjecture an idea but then the hard work is turning that into equations right.
*  And I guess just so people know correct me if I'm wrong here about how you think about this ordinary general relativity or other theories of gravity we would write down what they care about is the amount of energy at each point.
*  And that's what matters. But you're imagining changing it so that what matters is not just how much energy there is at each point but how it's distributed like if it's constant versus if it's lumpy and then that's a kind of a radical imagination of how to change gravity.
*  Yeah yeah kind of in a way that's one way of thinking about it. I think what I'm saying is is that is that sometimes you've got like a filter.
*  You've got the sources of energy and momentum and there's a filter but how that filter works is sensitive to the properties of the source.
*  So if the source is a planet the filter doesn't filter it at all it just lets it through. It's a high pass filter.
*  High pass filter.
*  Yeah exactly like a high pass filter exactly. But if the source is constant the filter shuts it down. That's the idea. So there's something in the theory which is acting like this filter that's saying you may pass you may not pass.
*  But doing that in a consistent way that's consistent with the underlying principles of general relativity and it's consistent with quantum mechanics is not easy.
*  You know one of the things that I found about you know a career thinking about gravity and trying to mess around with Einstein's theory is that you mess with Einstein's theory at your peril.
*  It's really difficult to mess with Einstein's theory and not unleash all manner of beasts and horrible creatures and cause all sorts of problems.
*  Instabilities you know new particles appearing that we don't see in nature. All sorts of problems that you can arise.
*  But one of the things you can do but by focusing on those changes only on the global scale so only on space time as a whole then you can actually sort of evade a lot of these problems.
*  Well you know since we've reached the hour long moment of the podcast we're allowed to let our hair down a little bit and get a little even crazier than we've been getting.
*  So I wanted to take it back to this finite versus infinite question because secretly there's a relationship to the cosmological constant.
*  You know you talked about holography and the information in a black hole and we talked about there's a cosmological constant that is accelerating the universe apart.
*  But that's why implicitly you said at the beginning of the podcast that there's reason to believe the universe has a finite set of information in it right.
*  Because there's a horizon around us with a finite entropy and maybe you could explain what I just said in more easily digestible terms.
*  Yes so of course we have this. Let's say that somehow there's some theory somewhere which solves the puzzle of why the vacuum energy isn't large.
*  So it's just some small number. The energy density of the universe is very low but it's positive and it's causing the universe to accelerate very gently.
*  Now what that means is that we live in what's called a De Sitter universe and we're surrounded by this horizon, this cosmological horizon, this De Sitter horizon in that case it would be.
*  And when you start trying to think about how many different ways there are to arrange sort of that universe, the quantum states of that universe, you think about the entropy of that universe.
*  It's again this weird property of gravity that always projects everything onto the surface area that surrounds it.
*  And in this case it's this De Sitter horizon. And that De Sitter horizon that surrounds, this shroud that surrounds our universe, that surrounds each and every one of us individually, has a finite area.
*  If the vacuum energy of the universe is small and positive.
*  And yes, so that's where I came back to these ideas about the universe having a pine-career recurrence. Such a universe would have a pine-career recurrence because you would think of it as a finite system.
*  And I think one of the things, this is not even a question, I'm just going to set that out there because I think people are not thinking about it enough, is that a universe that has a finite number of states, a finite number of degrees of freedom in its theoretical description, that's a universe that is not described by quantum field theory, right?
*  Which is what we always use to describe things. Quantum field theory has an infinite number of things going on.
*  And I don't think we've adapted, I don't think we've digested that shift quite as much as we should have.
*  I mean, I think that's because you have to bring an interplay between, you have to bring gravity into the game and of course then we're talking about quantum gravity, we don't really know what quantum gravity is yet.
*  Of course, as you know, as you remove gravity, as you decouple gravity, all these entropies that we're counting, so if I count what the entropy of the cyta space would be, as I decouple gravity, it goes infinite.
*  If I calculate the entropy of a black hole, as I decouple gravity, all these numbers go infinite because basically the entropy is the area divided by Newton's constant.
*  And as Newton's constant goes to zero, all these entropies go diverge.
*  So I'll give you a chance to ask a very simple question to end the podcast, but you can decide how, at what length you want to answer it.
*  Is the universe, is reality infinite or finite?
*  I think it's finite.
*  Wow.
*  Okay, I just, I just, I just, it's complete prejudice.
*  I have no answer for knowing this.
*  I just, part of me feels that there's no room for infinity in nature.
*  I don't know. That's a complete, I mean, there's probably loads of examples.
*  Everyone's going to get really upset at me saying this now, but I, intuitively, I just feel like the idea of a universe which is compact and, you know, spatially compact.
*  It seems much more elegant to me than having to meddle with the infinite world.
*  That's not to say that the infinite world isn't mathematically in itself wonderfully interesting and something you can think about.
*  And, but do we really need Kantor's sort of, you know, infinite heavens to describe our universe?
*  I don't know. Maybe we do.
*  Yeah.
*  My pure prejudice is that we probably don't.
*  I mean, I ask because I myself don't really know.
*  I don't even have a prejudice there.
*  You know, on the one hand, I feel the worries about infinity.
*  Like the mathematics of infinity gets tricky and maybe it's just because there isn't any real infinity in the physical description of reality.
*  But on the other hand, you know, infinity is a nice number in a way that 10 to the 120 isn't, right?
*  You know, if the universe is finite, then there's some specific size that it has.
*  And who ordered that? I'm not really sure.
*  Well, no, I think, I think, but then you can straight back at you with which infinity is it, Sean?
*  That's the next question you have to ask, right?
*  So is it out of zero? Is it out of one?
*  You know, there's a story doesn't end with infinity.
*  You've still got those same questions.
*  So if we keep ourselves in the finite realm, then things feel a little bit, I just feel a bit cozier.
*  All right. Let's feel cozy.
*  I think that's a good way to wrap up feeling like we're cozy in a finite little universe that we live in.
*  So Tony Padilla, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks, Sean.
*  You
