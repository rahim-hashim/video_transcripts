There are living creatures dwelling deep below the surface of the Earth, as deep as we are able to drill. These hearty microorganisms are related to more familiar life forms on land and under water, but the operate and survive in ways that are quite different from what we're familiar with. They live off of nutrients that have penetrated from the surface, or sometimes off of pure electrons. Karen Lloyd is a scientist who has traveled around the world studying these organisms, as she explains in her new book Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth.

Karen Lloyd received a Ph.D. in marine sciences from the University of North Carolina. She is currently the Wrigley Chair in Environmental Studies and Professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California. Among her awards are a Sloan Fellowship, a Simons Early Career Investigator, and a NASA Early Career Fellowship.

# Mindscape 314 | Karen Lloyd on the Deep Underground Biosphere
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. One of the things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that we've talked about many times here on the podcast is the idea of looking for life [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=5.22s)]
*  elsewhere in the universe, on other planets or moons here in the solar system like Mars, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=11.76s)]
*  Europa, Titan, maybe on exoplanets further away. And there's a bunch of obstacles to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=17.2s)]
*  finding life elsewhere. We haven't found any yet. We've had some hints of clues of things [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=23.48s)]
*  that might be life-related, but certainly nothing directly that could be characterized [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=28.88s)]
*  as life, partly because it's hard, right? Because you have to either fly far away or look very [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=32.72s)]
*  indirectly using some kind of signal, spectra, or even sample returns from some nearby planet. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=38.84s)]
*  But the other thing that is making it hard is that we're not sure what to look for. There are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=45.86s)]
*  characteristics that life has here on Earth that you can hope to find somewhere else, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  but maybe life somewhere else is still life, but nevertheless is very, very different and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=57.4s)]
*  therefore its characteristics or its signatures might be completely different. So you would think [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  that one super obvious strategy would be to make sure that we understand life here on Earth really, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=68.2s)]
*  really well if we're trying to understand the entire space of possibilities for what life could [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=76.24s)]
*  be. And to a certain extent, we know a lot about life on Earth, right? We have whole departments of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=81.24s)]
*  biology and so forth in our universities, all devoted to studying life on Earth because we [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=87.0s)]
*  don't have any examples of life elsewhere. But it turns out that there's still lots of life here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=92.64s)]
*  on Earth that we don't know a lot about. And today's episode is about one kind of life here [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=99.2s)]
*  on Earth that we don't know that much about compared to what we really would like to know. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=106.08s)]
*  Today's guest is Karen Lloyd who is described as a microbial biogeochemist at USC. And just [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=110.24s)]
*  that description should tell you that there's clearly a lot going on here. She has a new book [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  coming out called Intra-Terrestrials, Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth. And the basic idea [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  is that Karen studies life that exists underneath the surface of the Earth. So not just in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=130.4s)]
*  oceans or water or whatever, which counts as underneath the sea level, but there's still a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=137.24s)]
*  surface below that. This is below the surface of either land or sea, okay? Literally in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=141.84s)]
*  crust of the Earth, sometimes kilometers deep. It turns out that as far deeply as we can dig into [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=147.16s)]
*  the Earth, we can find life. We can find little microbes, little bacteria and archaea, two [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  different kingdoms of microbes as Mindscape listeners have heard before. They're there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=163.6s)]
*  They're there. They apparently live longer and move more slowly. They're a little bit more [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=168.96s)]
*  senescent than life here on the surface of the Earth, but they're there. Their biochemistry is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=175.24s)]
*  a little bit different. They can take advantage of different kinds of food and fuel sources. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=181.32s)]
*  They move at different rates and they're very clever about using the resources that they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=186.6s)]
*  have access to. So the fact that those things can exist here on Earth certainly informs both [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  questions about how life formed here on Earth, the origin of life, but also what life might be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  like somewhere else. And it turns out to nobody's surprise that these interterrestrials are, they're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=206.2s)]
*  related to the organisms that we know. Don't get me wrong. As far as we can tell, we've not yet [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  found an interterrestrial or a little microbe beneath the surface of the Earth that is completely [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=218.32s)]
*  separate from the rest of life on Earth, but you're also not surprised that they're different, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=223.32s)]
*  right? They've discovered different strategies, different evolutionary pathways that they've [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=227.72s)]
*  taken. So we're just beginning to study these little critters and we're learning a lot. And [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=232.06s)]
*  I think that that's going to teach us a lot about what life is like now here on Earth, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=238.76s)]
*  what life was back when it started, and what life might be like elsewhere in the universe. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=244.52s)]
*  These are all very exciting questions and you're getting in on the ground floor here in this episode. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=250.88s)]
*  So let's go. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=256.4s)]
*  Karen Lloyd, welcome to the Winescape Podcast. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=257.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=275.64s)]
*  So you're telling me there are whole species of life forms dwelling deep beneath the surface [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=277.48s)]
*  of the Earth. That sounds a little scary. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=286.8s)]
*  I know. But it's not just like a couple species. It's a lot of species, like billions of species. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=288.2s)]
*  And furthermore, it's not just a couple of extra types of things that are related to E. coli. It's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  deep branches on the tree of life, whole phyla that are not found elsewhere. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  Phyla being the plural of phylum. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=308.88s)]
*  Yes. And think about a phylum. I know this isn't something that... I know everybody had to learn it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  in biology classes. I always learned King Philip came over from Great Spain. So it's kingdom, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=318.08s)]
*  phylum, class, order, family, species. So if you go up that chain, up to phylum, that's sort of like [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=324.08s)]
*  a very deep evolutionary branch. And so things that are in different phyla have very different [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  ways of living. So I think... I always get confused about the animals, but I think that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=336.96s)]
*  all vertebrates are a phylum. That's our phylum. So basically us and turtles and everything with [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=343.28s)]
*  a backbone, we're the same phylum. So it's like we're discovering these new phyla, tens of them. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=349.12s)]
*  I like that you always get confused about animals, but you're up on the little microbes that we have. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  I know. It's hard to make it all match. I mean, humans just showed up five minutes ago. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=361.44s)]
*  So before you even get to the little microbes down there, how deep are we talking? What is it [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=370.64s)]
*  like down there? Yeah. So we can talk about different levels of deep because in some places, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=378.0s)]
*  what I consider to be the subsurface starts pretty shallow. If you're at a mud flat, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=384.8s)]
*  the stinky backside of a barrier island or something, and you dig your toes down a little [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=392.16s)]
*  bit, I think you're already there. Because the question is, are you in a stable enough environment [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=397.12s)]
*  that's sufficiently remote from steady inputs of oxygen and light? And if you are, then you're in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=402.8s)]
*  the subsurface. So I think it starts a couple centimeters down or even millimeters in some [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=410.72s)]
*  places. But then as far as it goes, we don't super know. We found life many kilometers deep down, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=415.68s)]
*  but we don't have a lot of samples from things that deep. When you say we found life, is this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=423.44000000000005s)]
*  literally from drilling and looking, or is there some other way? Yeah. So we've got two main ways [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=427.68s)]
*  we can get at the deep subsurface life. We can drill down to it, which as you can imagine, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  is incredibly expensive. And one of the best ways to get down there is to have it be run by profit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=439.44s)]
*  So if you can connect yourself up with a mining company, that's a good way to get deep subsurface [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=445.68s)]
*  samples. But another way is to wait for it to come back to you. So I do a lot of work where we use [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=451.04s)]
*  hot springs. It's real gross, but kind of like squeezing a pimple. When you run two continents [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=456.88s)]
*  against each other, which is what happens in all of our subduction zones along a lot of our coastlines, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=465.28s)]
*  you get things like earthquakes, you get things like volcanoes, and you also get things like hot [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  springs because you create all this pressure. And with this fluid comes up the deep subsurface [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  microbiome. Okay. But so again, as a non-geo person, like anything smaller than a galaxy, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=480.55999999999995s)]
*  I think is kind of weird for me to think about. So when we're kilometers, number one, how many [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=488.88s)]
*  kilometers deep do we know about? And number two, that's still the crust of the earth? Or are we down [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=495.2s)]
*  at a lower level? Yeah. So we're talking about the crust. So the crust is somewhere 20 kilometers to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=501.12s)]
*  200 kilometers deep. And we can make the sort of M&M candy cutaway pictures of earth that I'm sure [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=510.32s)]
*  everybody's seeing with the cores on the inside. And then there's the big mantle, and then there's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=520.96s)]
*  that thin crust around the outside, which is actually quite deep. If you think about it from [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=524.96s)]
*  biological terms, you know, hundreds of kilometers is actually a lot of depth. But we've never [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  actually drilled like humans have never drilled below maybe 10 kilometers. Okay, never. Like it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=535.44s)]
*  for any reason, not just for biology. And that's something that I think hasn't really, it's maybe [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  something you wouldn't realize because like, oh, well, we know so much about the mantle, we know [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=547.52s)]
*  so much about the core, certainly someone has sampled it like, no, no one's ever been there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=551.52s)]
*  So it's all indirect through earthquakes, seismology, things like that. Yeah, which is, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=556.16s)]
*  I mean, not to put those down, they've created a beautiful image of what's down there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=560.88s)]
*  Okay, but you need to actually dig down there. And have you ever has any drilling ever reached a point [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=565.28s)]
*  where we can look at there and say there's nothing living there? Or do we keep finding life forms [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=571.68s)]
*  along all along the way? Yeah, it's always hard to conclude there's nothing living in a place. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=578.08s)]
*  Okay, including Mars. As far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out. I don't think that we have [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=585.28s)]
*  found life on Mars. But I don't think that we have not. We have found definitive proof there's not [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=592.0s)]
*  life on Mars. So it would be the same thing for the subsurface. Okay, we will we will get to we'll [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=596.08s)]
*  get to Mars definitely over the course of the podcast, but here on Earth. So it's entirely [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=601.12s)]
*  dark, obviously, down there where we're talking. Is there any flow of either water or the sort of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=606.16s)]
*  rocks kind of on super long time scales moving around in some way? Yes to all of that, depending [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=614.24s)]
*  on where you're looking, because it you know, what's underneath our feet is actually quite varied [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=621.52s)]
*  and kind of an interesting place. It's not a place that it's easy for humans to go. But if you're [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=628.24s)]
*  tiny, there's a lot of options. So on continents, there's aquifers, which we use for drinking water. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=633.44s)]
*  There's even deeper aqua aquifers that we would not use for drinking water, because they're full of [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  nasty chemicals and stuff that we don't want to use. But those things can be useful for microbes. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  So some of these aquifers, like for the ones that are capped by the Canadian shield have been [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=650.24s)]
*  isolated. That water is like billions of years old that the water itself, which is crazy to think [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=657.04s)]
*  that liquid water has just hung out liquid for that long. So that that's one possibility. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  There's other places where you get an influx of lots of energy, like these continental collision [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=671.1999999999999s)]
*  zones, so subduction zones or continental margins, like, for instance, the the Andes, that great, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=678.48s)]
*  beautiful, super tall mountain chain that runs pretty much the whole way down South America on [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=685.52s)]
*  the west side is driven by the Pacific plate going underneath that continent. And that pressure sort [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=691.68s)]
*  of basically makes the volcanoes happen. And so in the process of two continents colliding, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=698.48s)]
*  there's a lot of activity and there's a lot of chemical reactions, there's tectonic reactions, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=705.76s)]
*  there can be a lot of hydrogen produced through a process called serpentinization, depending on [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  what type of rocks are being subducted. And that's a great reaction, because it's just rocks and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=716.24s)]
*  water, and it makes everything you need to run life, which is kind of amazing. But then there's [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=722.0s)]
*  also the board places too, where nothing happens. Nothing. Oh, okay, good. That's something. But I [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=726.96s)]
*  got to ask about the billion year old water. I mean, the idea of water being billions of years old [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=732.24s)]
*  actually isn't shocking to me in terms of the water molecule could be billions of years old, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=736.16s)]
*  but you're saying that it has been preserved in liquid form basically untouched for billions of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=741.68s)]
*  years, which probably is shocking. It never became rain. It never became ice. It was never snow. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=746.8s)]
*  It was never a cloud. And why in my simple minded way, like, why isn't this water all been squeezed [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=753.36s)]
*  out by now? Like, why is it still hanging kilometers below the surface of the earth? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=759.76s)]
*  That's more of a geologist. I don't know. I don't want to venture too hard. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=763.44s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=770.24s)]
*  Yeah, I want to not veer too far. I sort of have to work. I collaborate a lot with geologists [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  who provide the context for this stuff, for the most part for me. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, good. But we can think of- [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=783.6s)]
*  All I understand is there's a big Canadian shield sitting on it. It's hard to get out. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's perfectly plausible. So are there temperature gradients from place to place or is [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=789.52s)]
*  it more or less uniform everywhere? Yeah, there's huge temperature gradients. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=796.56s)]
*  And temperature is something that ultimately will limit life as we know it because it's some, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=801.76s)]
*  you know, everything we know about so far is carbon based life. And at some high temperature, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  you're not going to get carbon molecules holding together in the way that we know that they need to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=813.1199999999999s)]
*  have life function. So that is going to be a limiter at some point. We just, you know, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=818.08s)]
*  sometimes that gradient happens really shallow. Like if you're standing in a volcano, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=823.52s)]
*  it happens at your feet. Right. So we do want temperature gradients, but we don't want the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=827.36s)]
*  temperature to be too high. And you're saying that lots of the earth's lithosphere, I guess, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=833.76s)]
*  qualifies for that. Yeah, it's probably just too hot. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=839.84s)]
*  It's probably just too hot. And okay, so what kind of coverage do we have in terms of digging [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  deeply and looking for life forms? Have we sampled the whole surface of the earth or is there still [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=850.0s)]
*  a great uncharted territory? It's a massive uncharted territory. I mean, it's just if you, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=854.08s)]
*  I think people wonderfully are getting a good feel for how unknown the oceans are. And that is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=859.6s)]
*  absolutely the case. We just don't know a lot about what's in the deep sea. And I work in the deep sea [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  and that's one of the mysterious places that I try to crack into. But when you study the deep sea, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=872.96s)]
*  you can toss a bucket off the back of a ship and take a sample. And you can do that all day long, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=879.6s)]
*  or you can do that for weeks on end and get lots and lots of samples of deep waters. I mean, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=884.72s)]
*  it's hard to work in, but it's possible. We can't do that in the crust. We can't just like throw [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=889.9200000000001s)]
*  something over the side and like have it drop down because it's ground. So getting those samples is [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=896.64s)]
*  always going to be slower and more laborious than working in the ocean. And so we, I think it is just [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=902.72s)]
*  a fascinating frontier. And when you go to different places and dig and find some little [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=909.6s)]
*  microbe, do you find different kinds of microbes in different places or is there kind of a uniform [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=916.32s)]
*  population spread over the earth's surface? Yes, to both. Like all your options you're giving me, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=921.12s)]
*  like for all these questions are like yes to everything. Because the thing is, it's like, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=928.08s)]
*  it's this whole world down there. It's like a second earth buried underneath our earth. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=932.72s)]
*  So there are places where we see different types of microbes in different places. That is definitely [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  true. There does seem to be some like endemic populations that are only found in the place that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=941.76s)]
*  we find them. But we have a couple of weird instances and I still have trouble wrapping [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=946.48s)]
*  my brain around this. But there are some deeply buried aquifer microbes that seem to have an [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=952.8s)]
*  unchanged genome all around the world. This is called the Sulphurutus Auxiater. And I don't know [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  why I didn't do this work. This is my colleagues, but I've talked to them about it. And they're [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=966.4799999999999s)]
*  like, yeah, we don't know why either. We find it very unsettling. We're going to get the podcast [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=969.92s)]
*  transcribed. So could you say that name again more slowly? The Sulphurutus Auxiater. Wow. Okay. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=974.56s)]
*  It means bold traveler. Bold traveler. Well, because presumably the resources are very [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=982.64s)]
*  different down there, right? I mean, they're going to be optimized for a very different [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  environment than the bugs we have up here on earth. Yeah. Yeah. There's not a lot of oxygen. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  There could be some oxygen, but for the most part, there's not much oxygen. And, you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=997.68s)]
*  if you think about what drives the power's life up at the surface, it's the sun. I mean, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1003.28s)]
*  pretty much everything flows from that. Even though we're not photosynthetic, we're absolutely [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1007.76s)]
*  dependent upon plants. But in the subsurface, there's no photosynthesis, there's no sunlight. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1012.16s)]
*  And so all of that activity has to be fueled by chemical reactions. But the nice thing about the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1018.0s)]
*  chemical reactions is that there's just a gigantic variety of them. There's just a ton of options, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1023.28s)]
*  because if there's one thing they're rich in, it's minerals and metals and things that have a lot of [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1028.56s)]
*  redox power, so they can be oxidized and reduced chemically. Okay. So yeah, so tell us about what [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1033.36s)]
*  we know about the life forms. I mean, I guess you said already, there's a lot of them. I mean, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1039.52s)]
*  I don't know whether it's better to go by mass or by number of cells, but tell us how much life is [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1045.36s)]
*  down there. Well, we, we, estimates, of course, these are any of these big numbers would be [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1050.4799999999998s)]
*  estimates, are about 10 to the 29 living microbial cells in the subsurface. And they're small. So [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1056.4s)]
*  biomass wise, they're not going to be, you know, the total number of plants up at the surface, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1064.64s)]
*  because plants are, plants are big. But, but really it's a gigantic ecosystem. And to be as [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1069.76s)]
*  undescribed as it is, you know, it's, it's a lot of cells. I usually say it's 10,000 times more [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  than the estimated number of stars in the universe. What do you think? That's good. I, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1084.96s)]
*  yes, that definitely does sound right. I think maybe 10 to the 23, 10 to the 24 is the number [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  of stars, but I would have to look it up. So I think, I think you're on the right track. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1094.64s)]
*  But then you have to say like, what's a star versus one microbial cell. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  That's right. So it's kind of interesting. And are we, you know, when we, when we pull them up, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1101.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, sorry, let me, let's just be like, very down and dirty about what you do. Do you go to a [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1106.08s)]
*  oil well or something and you like put a little claw on the bottom of it? Like, how do we get a [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1112.5600000000002s)]
*  sample from down there? There's a bunch of different ways. One is to take a drilling ship [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1118.96s)]
*  and go out in the ocean and basically this drill string. It's like, it's just a big pipe. It's like [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1126.3200000000002s)]
*  a big metal pipe with a really, really angry, angry looking drill bit on the front of it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1132.24s)]
*  And you put that thing down there and you basically like drill through whatever you need [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1137.6s)]
*  to drill through. And then you send down pipe after pipe. And if, if it, if the drilling is [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1142.24s)]
*  going well, you can actually do advanced piston coring, which is where you make up, you detonate [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1147.12s)]
*  a little explosion at the seafloor and it forces like a big stroke and it forces this pipe down [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1151.4399999999998s)]
*  further and you can get like nine meters in just like a couple of seconds. And so that's, that's [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1157.6s)]
*  the cleanest sample because you don't need to actually drill and provide fluid and stuff like [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1162.3999999999999s)]
*  that. So that's, that's one way we get samples. And this is done specifically for scientists like [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1166.08s)]
*  you. This isn't, you're not parasitic on something else? Again, yes to both. Okay, yes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1172.0s)]
*  I mean, we do everything we can to get these samples. I, I will say it, I don't know how much [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  you sort of want to talk about current, current events, but we, we have the Joy Days Resolution [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1185.1999999999998s)]
*  is the name of the ship that we use to do this drilling in the ocean and it has sunset. It was [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1190.96s)]
*  time for it to go and the US was supporting that ship and the United States does not have plans to [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  replace it. So China has built one, but we don't have one in the States anymore. That just isn't, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1202.72s)]
*  it's a capability that we no longer have in the United States and we've always been a leader in [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1209.52s)]
*  deep sea drilling, but it's gone. There you go. Okay. Someone picks it up and saves us. Well, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1213.92s)]
*  you know, maybe this is send the podcast out there and who knows what will happen. And then so when [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1219.68s)]
*  you pull the sample up, what do you do? You bring it back to the lab? Yeah, you, well, usually if [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1224.8s)]
*  you're talking about at sea, you know, we have these labs on ships basically. And so we, for these [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1230.72s)]
*  deep drilling operations, we split the core in half and then you go down the length of it and you [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1236.8s)]
*  take subsamples. So it takes these processing, these samples is always slow and laborious and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1242.32s)]
*  takes a lot of people. And you just kind of, everybody comes in with their different sampling [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1247.68s)]
*  equipment and takes their piece and they measure chemicals of all different sorts. They measure [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1251.84s)]
*  gases and then they take a microbial sample to grow things, a microbial sample to look at their [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1256.24s)]
*  DNA, their RNA, things like that. So we just try to, we try to measure everything we can when we get [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1261.76s)]
*  these precious samples. And when you find little microbes from deep below the surface, are they, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1267.28s)]
*  how related are they to the ones up here on, on the surface? Are they recognizable or are they [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1274.08s)]
*  something completely alien looking? So at first, now they're recognizable because we have been [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1279.36s)]
*  digging there enough that we can compare them to each other. But when we first started getting them, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, I, the, the ability to use DNA from the environment to infer what's living there [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  is something that only came into popular usage in the early 2000s. So this was when I was a graduate [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1298.0s)]
*  student and I got my first samples from Deep Sea Mud from the Gulf of Mexico. There was a methane [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1303.76s)]
*  seep. I thought I was going to be studying the organisms that use the methane because that's, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1309.84s)]
*  that's the biggest signal that we see there. And I, I looked at the DNA sequences that I had and they, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1313.92s)]
*  they didn't look like anything at the surface. They didn't, I, I thought I was a terrible [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1320.16s)]
*  scientist. Like I really was like, Oh my God, I'm never going to get a PhD because I can't [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1324.8s)]
*  even do this simple task of figuring out who these, these organisms are. And then it turns [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1329.9199999999998s)]
*  out it wasn't my problem at all. It wasn't me. It was that we were all collectively discovering [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1335.36s)]
*  new stuff and, and nobody had ever seen it before. So we actually have complete DNA sequences of these [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1340.32s)]
*  little critters. Yeah. So fast forward to now, technology has really moved. I mean, we, our field [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1345.9199999999998s)]
*  has been moving really, really fast. It's very, I think it's very impressive. We can now pull out [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1352.56s)]
*  whole genomes from these little critters without having to grow them. So we can look not just at [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1358.24s)]
*  their entire genome. We can also pull out all of their messenger RNA molecules, which that is the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1363.2s)]
*  molecule that basically says, okay, what proteins are going to get made? We can pull out their actual [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1369.04s)]
*  proteins and see what they're doing. So we can infer their lifestyles from all of these biomolecules [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1374.24s)]
*  that we can pull out from, from, you know, deep sea muck. And do they fall into the traditional [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1380.24s)]
*  categories, bacteria, archaea, maybe viruses? I don't know. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1385.1999999999998s)]
*  Kind of, yes, definitely viruses, which are weird and hard to characterize. But they are definitely [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  falling into bacteria. There are some that fall into eukaryotes. That's our branch. Definitely fall [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1396.3999999999999s)]
*  into the archaea. But there is a branch of them that has really upended our understanding of what [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1401.36s)]
*  things are. And this is, we've been calling it the Asgard Archaeota. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1409.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I've heard about that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1413.4399999999998s)]
*  This is one of the groups that I was finding as a graduate student and just like, oh God, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1414.24s)]
*  I don't know what this thing is. It has now been grown in culture by two labs so far. It may be [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1420.08s)]
*  more labs than I just don't know about them. But Christa Schlepper's lab in Austria and [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1428.56s)]
*  Hiroyuki Amachi's lab at JAMSTEC in Japan have managed to grow this thing. And so it's really [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1433.36s)]
*  amazing to have hypothesized of the existence of these strange primordial weirdos. And then it's [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1440.24s)]
*  like, am I doing this right? Is my inference right? And now they're actually growing them. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
*  And yeah, they are strange and weird. And they're a little bit between the archaea and the eukaryotes. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1451.28s)]
*  So that's why, that's my answer to your question. They're kind of making us question our divisions. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1458.08s)]
*  Well, I was going to ask, in what way are they strange and weird? So like, what does it mean [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1463.52s)]
*  to say they're halfway in between bacteria and archaea? Okay, so, well, they're halfway in between [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1467.4399999999998s)]
*  archaea and eukaryotes. Eukaryotes, yeah, sorry. So if you, back to like, intro bio classes, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1474.32s)]
*  we all had to learn the difference between a prokaryote and a eukaryote. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1482.24s)]
*  Let's imagine we forgot that. Yeah. That's why? Let's imagine we've forgotten that since then. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1485.84s)]
*  No, no. I mean, I might have had that lecture, but I'm also old. So fill me in. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  So eukaryotes have a well-defined nucleus. So they have all their DNA that sits inside an organelle. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  They have well, we, sorry, we are eukaryotes. We have well-defined organelles, one of which [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1502.96s)]
*  is a mitochondria, which is the powerhouse of the cell. So if you look at, we tend to be bigger, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1507.84s)]
*  our cells tend to be bigger. And so if you look at a eukaryotic cell under the microscope, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1512.64s)]
*  you'll see all of these little organelles within it that do different functions. And it's a very [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1517.6s)]
*  complex cell and it always breeds oxygen because we're all dependent on oxygen. Although we can [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1522.0s)]
*  also do some fermentation. We need oxygen or we die. All eukaryotes, that's true. Well, there's [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1527.36s)]
*  some protists that are exceptions, but then you compare it to the bacteria in the archaea [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1533.36s)]
*  and they don't have the structures. They are sort of like little bags of goo. That's sort of how [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1538.7199999999998s)]
*  they're characterized in our textbooks. They have nuclear condensation. Like their genomes are in a [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1544.48s)]
*  specific region, but they don't have a house around them. They don't have organelles. They're just, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1551.52s)]
*  they're simpler. It's kind of everything is out and floating around and they're not as organized. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1556.88s)]
*  Okay. That's like where we were until we discovered these ones, these Asgard's, that we first saw this [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1561.76s)]
*  in the DNA, they have the DNA for the cytoskeletal elements that we use as eukaryotes to make all [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1571.6s)]
*  these organelles. So just with bioinformatics, with the DNA, we all started saying, hey, it looks like [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1578.7199999999998s)]
*  these things actually could have organelles in the same way that eukaryotes do, but they're not. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1586.56s)]
*  They're archaea. And one of the things that we know about how we got these organelles as eukaryotes, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1591.84s)]
*  these mitochondria that we have that help us to breathe oxygen, is that we definitely got those. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1598.4s)]
*  Some ancestor of ours picked those up by taking in an alpha proteobacteria. That we know for sure. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1603.92s)]
*  So the question is, who ate the alpha proteobacteria and became a eukaryote? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  And to all appearances, these are the direct descendants of that ancestor before it picked [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1619.2800000000002s)]
*  up the alpha proteobacteria that turned into mitochondria and became a eukaryote. And so they [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1625.84s)]
*  retain a lot of these features that we thought were only in eukaryotes, but now we're finding them in [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1631.6799999999998s)]
*  archaea. So the archaea, the sort of standard archaea are like the bags of goo, but these Asgardians [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1639.28s)]
*  have the DNA to make compartments, substructures within themselves, but they haven't yet gotten to [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1647.36s)]
*  the point where they have the mitochondria and are full-blown eukaryotes. Exactly. Exactly. And so [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1655.12s)]
*  since they have these elements that we thought were only present in full-blown eukaryotes, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1662.7199999999998s)]
*  the question is, well, what in the hell are they doing with them? Why do they have them? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1668.4799999999998s)]
*  We know about them running an endoplasmic reticulum and a Golgi apparatus and a mitochondria. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1674.32s)]
*  What are they doing with them? And so figuring that out has been fascinating. We still don't [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1679.76s)]
*  really know, but now the first images are coming out from these cultures and they are using them. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1685.52s)]
*  They have structure. They're tiny. They're the width of visible light. They're the amplitude [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1690.8s)]
*  of visible light. That's the size of their cell. And they've got arms. And they're only so far [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1698.08s)]
*  found beneath the surface. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1707.0400000000002s)]
*  There's one report that's out that someone found them up in the surface waters. So what I've learned [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1712.0800000000002s)]
*  is anytime you think you've nailed down where something is and isn't on earth, it's going to [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1718.0s)]
*  say, screw you. I don't care. I'm nature. I'm going to do what I want to do. But they are not [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1723.1200000000001s)]
*  for the most part. If you look at somebody's gut microbiome, you will never find this one. I don't [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1729.68s)]
*  think that they've colonized us. You will find, sorry, will you find both bacteria and archaea [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1736.4s)]
*  in our gut microbiome? Absolutely. All the methane that comes out of cows, that's all produced by [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1741.68s)]
*  archaea. Okay. So, I mean, naively, since I can be naive, this is not my job. So it sounds like this [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1749.28s)]
*  is a step along the way from archaea to eukaryotes. Yeah, I would say it absolutely is. Yeah. Okay, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1756.96s)]
*  good. And I love the mystery now that they, because biology, you know, evolution doesn't [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  let you carry along all this extra equipment that you don't use, right? And so we're looking for the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1769.44s)]
*  usefulness of it. I mean, one obvious usefulness might be it's hard to live down there. Tell us [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1774.0s)]
*  about the sort of ecosystem that you have. Like, what do you eat? What do you drink? Where do you [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1780.64s)]
*  go for fun if you're a couple of kilometers below the surface? That's great. So these guys, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1787.92s)]
*  for the most part, or the places where we find them in highest abundance tend to be [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1794.8000000000002s)]
*  marine sediments that got buried thousands of years ago or longer, where nothing much has happened [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1799.76s)]
*  at all. So like, if you can think about your life, what it would be like if you're on a particle, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1805.76s)]
*  you fall to the seafloor, other things fall around you, and then nothing really changes. You get [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1810.64s)]
*  diffusion. Diffusion is where you go for fun. It's like, hey, we got a hydrogen molecule this century. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1816.4s)]
*  That was exciting. Slow paced. It's a, you know, it's a sleepy town. It's a very sleepy town, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  but it's a huge ecosystem. So it's like, well, what are they all doing? Why are they all sitting [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  there doing nothing? So where do they get their nutrition? From, so, well, we're not totally sure, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1835.36s)]
*  but the biggest form of nutrition would be what got buried with them. So the organic matter, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1845.1999999999998s)]
*  the dead plants and dead phytoplankton that got buried with them, they just basically eat it super, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1851.4399999999998s)]
*  super slowly. So it's like, if you got given a pizza and then said, this is all you're getting [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1858.08s)]
*  for the rest of your life, make it last. So that's kind of how they live. And there's definitely an [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1864.08s)]
*  idea that all of the time scales are much slower, right? There's no rush when you're down there, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1870.48s)]
*  and I guess that makes sense because your resources are stretched a little thin. You [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1878.6399999999999s)]
*  don't want to use them up too quickly. Yeah, you can't rush. You know, if you're late for a meeting [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1881.84s)]
*  and you want to run to that meeting, you may not run as quickly if you didn't eat breakfast. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. You know, these guys have never had breakfast. They can't speed up. So they're just [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1893.76s)]
*  kind of chill. So how quickly do they reproduce, for example? We don't know. Well, okay, we know [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1898.56s)]
*  about the cultures. So in the cultures, they will divide, every cell will divide every couple of [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1906.72s)]
*  weeks. And how does that compare to things we see up here on the surface? Insanely slow. Like every, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1913.44s)]
*  all the bacteria, like normal microbiology, like when you talk to a microbiologist and say, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1921.12s)]
*  like, oh, you've got a culture, how long does your culture, what's the cell division rate of [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1926.8s)]
*  your culture? They'll usually say something like, oh, it's really fast. It divides every half hour, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1930.8s)]
*  like E. coli, or they'll be like, oh, it's such a pain in the butt. It takes two hours to divide. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  But you still, it means that you can start a cell culture at the end of the day, go home, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1941.4399999999998s)]
*  go to bed and come back the next day. And then you'll have a nice fully grown sample waiting [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  for you to work on. And that's true for the vast majority of things that we study in lab, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1950.4s)]
*  including the archaea. You know, I used to work with a methanogen that grew at 100 degrees Celsius. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1955.8400000000001s)]
*  So extremophile, tough place to live. It ate hydrogen and breathe CO2 and made methane from [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1961.3600000000001s)]
*  it. And so I would make this culture that was perfectly clear. It looked like a terrible place [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1968.88s)]
*  to live. And I would throw it in a vat of boiling water. And then the next morning, I would have this [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1973.8400000000001s)]
*  happy growing culture so fast. So it's not it's not that archaea can't be fast. Or, yeah, obviously, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1979.2s)]
*  we know bacteria are fast, because that's where all the pathogens are. These guys, they're never [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1985.8400000000001s)]
*  going to get to that big turbid culture. And they're only going to divide once every couple [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  weeks. So the idea of performing experiments on their physiology in the way that we would for [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=1997.3600000000001s)]
*  something that we can grow quickly in lab is is an is a non starter. And this once every couple [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2002.48s)]
*  weeks is in what is presumably ideal circumstances for them. You're giving them food and whatever. So [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2007.76s)]
*  maybe underneath the surface, they're actually waiting even longer. That's right. That's that's [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2013.44s)]
*  what we think. And so we're we're trying to get out how quickly they grow under, you know, in these [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2018.64s)]
*  natural systems. And we can get it in a couple ways. We can look at how much energy they have [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2024.8799999999999s)]
*  available because we can measure all the chemicals around them. And we can measure how quickly those [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2030.72s)]
*  chemicals go away because we can see that the sediments are layered. So the sediments like act [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2034.96s)]
*  like a recorder tape, like a time time recorder tape of how these things are used. And so we can [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  basically through differential equations figure out the rate at which this food is being used [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2046.56s)]
*  by the whole community. And then when we run those numbers and calculate exactly how much energy [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2051.68s)]
*  everyone has to go and rush to their meeting or whatever they've got to do, it is [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2057.44s)]
*  a thousand to a ten thousand times less than anything that's grown in lab would be able to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2061.84s)]
*  survive on. So it's like there's probably lots of errors and there are definitely errors in our [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2070.96s)]
*  calculations because, you know, we're inferring things. But when you when your conclusion is, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, 10 is like three, four orders of magnitude off from, from, you know, what you know, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2084.24s)]
*  then you can be off by two orders of magnitude and you're still right. So basically what all [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2092.64s)]
*  this means is that they're not growing. They're not growing at all. They're very slow. I mean, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2097.52s)]
*  which is crazy. Do I remember correctly that when a bacterium divides, maybe this is true for archaea [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2101.28s)]
*  as well, they're not exact, exact duplicates, the two offspring, but one is like the older one and [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2107.52s)]
*  one is brand new. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah. Because a lot of bacteria will make an old poll [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2114.72s)]
*  so that it's a polar cell division and you put all the old proteins and stuff on the old poll. And so [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2120.48s)]
*  you end up you don't have to spread that stuff to a daughter cell. You can make a fresh daughter cell [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2127.2s)]
*  with younger proteins. And that's a that's a good strategy. So in principle, I don't know if they [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2131.6s)]
*  do that or not. A bacterium could die of old age. Yeah, they should. If you just keep accumulating [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2136.72s)]
*  all the old stuff on one side and making everything new. So it so some of these, is it, is it mostly [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2145.4399999999996s)]
*  bacteria that you're getting up from down there or mostly archaea? We used to debate a lot about [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  that. And then I basically we never settled it and we just kind of got bored of the debate. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2160.3999999999996s)]
*  Stop doing it. That used to be a really hot topic, but it's funny how like everybody runs after [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2164.4s)]
*  something. I think it's it's pretty clear that there's a lot of both of them. There's a lot of [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2169.92s)]
*  both. OK, but we can imagine that some of them are, you know, in this sense that bacteria could die [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2173.84s)]
*  of old age or whatever. Some of these critters are very, very old. You know, maybe they haven't [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2179.76s)]
*  been dividing every week. They've been dividing every year or whatever. Yeah, it's I mean, that's [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2184.64s)]
*  we're not dividing at all. I mean, they have to replace broken parts like you can't you can't [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2190.88s)]
*  maintain a cell for thousands of years without any effort into keeping it put together. And one of [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2196.08s)]
*  the things that we measure to actually make measurements of this is, do you know about the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2203.6s)]
*  chirality of amino acids? I do, but let's imagine that not everyone else does. OK, OK, so chirality [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2208.08s)]
*  is basically just handedness. So you can have the same molecule, but you turn around sort of what [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2216.08s)]
*  what face different parts of the chemical are sticking out of. So it function chemically is [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2222.08s)]
*  the same. It doesn't have any different chemical function, but it can be distinguished by something [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2228.48s)]
*  that can recognize the handedness and chirality is handedness because our two hands are chiral. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2233.6s)]
*  They all have the same fingers, but you can't perfectly overlay them because the front and the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2238.72s)]
*  back are different. OK, so that is also true for amino acids, which are what make up proteins. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2243.04s)]
*  For some reason, this is still one of the big mysteries of life. All of our proteins and all [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2249.04s)]
*  the proteins in all life ways we know it has one handedness. It's one type of chirality. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2254.64s)]
*  So if you take a living organism like a person or a cell and you kill it so that it can't do [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2260.96s)]
*  any maintenance to itself, it will naturally revert to a random mixture of the two types of [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2267.92s)]
*  chirality of its amino acids just from the background. Yes, just from the background. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2275.12s)]
*  It's a great little time recorder of how long it's been since something has died. Of course, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2280.32s)]
*  this process is super slow, so you need something. This is not useful in forensics. This is useful [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2285.92s)]
*  for things that have been dead for millennia. We can measure the ratio of the two handedness [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  the amino acids in these sediments and we can see they're keeping them alive. They are not [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2298.4s)]
*  letting everything go to this random mixture of the two hands. So it means that they are [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2305.28s)]
*  maintaining themselves. But to maintain chirality, to maintain membrane integrity, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2311.44s)]
*  to keep your DNA intact, to do all these maintenance things to make your body whole, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2317.92s)]
*  you don't necessarily need to actually undergo cell division. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2324.32s)]
*  Okay, good. Go ahead. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2328.96s)]
*  So when we make estimates of growth rate, it's not necessarily making new cells. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2331.84s)]
*  It's the amount of time we estimate it takes to recreate your body so that you are intact. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2339.1200000000003s)]
*  So for at least some of these microbes, they're basically sitting there doing what to a person [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2345.28s)]
*  would look like almost nothing. They're just sitting there. They're not even dividing. They're [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2352.24s)]
*  not moving. They're not going anywhere. But you're telling me that at the micro level, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2356.64s)]
*  they're still engaging in self-repair. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2361.2s)]
*  Yeah. And sometimes I'll have, when I explain this to people, sometimes people will say, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2364.72s)]
*  well, why study them? They're just dying. They're not, but I mean, we are too. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2369.52s)]
*  We're all dying. That's no reason. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2375.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, everybody's on their way. So what is happening in their lives? It's just their lives [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2377.92s)]
*  are potentially lasting for millennia. So what does that life look like? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2385.28s)]
*  Is there some possibility that these are the longest lived organisms on earth? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  I would say there's a good chance they are the longest lived organisms on earth. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2395.84s)]
*  If only they could talk. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2399.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2401.6800000000003s)]
*  What stories they could tell. Well, they're probably underground. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2402.2400000000002s)]
*  They have an alarm. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  So you say that some of them survive off of the detritus that sort of seeped down from the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2405.36s)]
*  surface world, but maybe others don't? Are there clever little microbes that are just living off [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2415.1200000000003s)]
*  of the chemicals? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2424.48s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. So there's a really cool background thing that happens everywhere [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2426.4s)]
*  on earth's crust for free, which is radioactive decay. And so there's tons of when earth accreted, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2431.36s)]
*  we ended up with a lot of radioactive elements. And I'll say this for your listeners, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2438.4s)]
*  because I'm sure you know this, Sean, but radioactive elements are ones that spontaneously [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2442.96s)]
*  fall apart. And when they do that, they release a little bolus of energy of different sorts. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2448.08s)]
*  And so no matter whether it's alpha, beta, or gamma type of radiation, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2453.36s)]
*  when that interacts with pure water, it will, some of it will split apart the water into [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2458.56s)]
*  hydrogen and oxygen. And this is not by and large a very exciting process that's going to make us [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2464.7999999999997s)]
*  a lot of hydrogen that we can pull out of the ground because it's, you know, for our own energy, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2471.92s)]
*  just simply because it is a slow process that's happening in the background all the time. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2477.2s)]
*  But if you're already a slow microbe, you can actually live off of the radioactive decay of [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2482.16s)]
*  water, which is kind of cool. I mean, you're telling me there's a race of subterranean [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2487.6s)]
*  dwellers in the dark that live off of radiation. So this sounds like a movie. Yeah, I'm telling me [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2495.2s)]
*  that. Happily, they move very slow, so you will not be invading the surface world anytime soon. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2499.92s)]
*  And I think I remember reading that you said that some of them go so far as to basically [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2506.88s)]
*  live off of electrons. Yeah, for sure. Because that's what a chemical reaction is. You know, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2511.36s)]
*  if you had to take organic chemistry, which I bet you loved, because everybody loves organic [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2518.08s)]
*  chemistry, then you always pushed electrons, you draw those little arrows to move electrons [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  onto something and then, you know, pop the next electrons onto something else until they can be [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2527.36s)]
*  stable on oxygen or something like that. So chemistry that changes the redox or even non [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2531.76s)]
*  redox chemistry often involves the movement of electrons. Certainly, in a redox reaction, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2538.88s)]
*  it's a movement of electrons. So there are organisms that just cut to the chase and don't [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2544.2400000000002s)]
*  deal with the diffusion of chemicals. They just literally move electrons through appendages that [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2550.8s)]
*  are basically tiny little wires. In the sense that they're like conductive materials and that [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2556.48s)]
*  electrons can flow through. Yeah, exactly. And they're made of proteins that have basically [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2564.0s)]
*  conjugated. So metals work by moving electrons through a conduit where it can move, it can flow, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2570.24s)]
*  and biological material can also be put together in such a way that electrons can flow through [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2580.48s)]
*  it as well. And so these cells do it. That is impressive that they can do that. And it's a [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2585.92s)]
*  reminder that it's not the energy that matters. It's the free energy, right? It's the gradient [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2592.32s)]
*  from place to place. Like just being in a hot environment is not enough, but these little [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  quitters are clever enough to take advantage of disequilibria somehow. Yeah, and I think that's [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2602.96s)]
*  one of the things that I personally have gotten out of all of these things is that a lot of the [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2610.1600000000003s)]
*  specifics that we attribute to being necessary for life, oxygen, light, space to move around, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2616.72s)]
*  fast growth, dying after 100 years or 1000 years, none of that is necessary for life. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2622.64s)]
*  What's necessary for life is what you just said. You got to have gradients of free energy that you [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2629.2799999999997s)]
*  can exploit. And they're all over the place. And maybe you need water also. Water seems pretty [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2634.7999999999997s)]
*  important. Yeah, it seems pretty important. Yeah, I think you need water. I definitely wouldn't say [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2640.24s)]
*  that you don't need water. But you don't need nearly as much of it as we normally think. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2645.12s)]
*  We're finding life in ancient permafrost that doesn't have a lot of liquid water because it's [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2651.7599999999998s)]
*  mostly in the form of ice. But they still seem to maintain their cell integrity there. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2657.04s)]
*  Okay. So maybe we can go back to this question of how they fit into the tree of life. I mean, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2662.4s)]
*  there's this fun possibility that we've discovered a stepping stone, a missing link between archaea [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  and eukaryotes. But is there more to say about the origin of life or at least like [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2674.96s)]
*  last universal common ancestor kinds of questions? Yeah, I mean, one thing that we're finding with [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2681.76s)]
*  all these things is that they are made up of the same stuff that the rest of us are. So we still [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2686.8s)]
*  haven't removed ourselves from the world of DNA, for instance, which is kind of interesting. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2690.56s)]
*  We're finding all these extra branches on the tree of life, but they're still using DNA. So [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2696.32s)]
*  at least for life as we know it, DNA seems to be primordial, the last universal common ancestor. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2701.04s)]
*  It's hard to say where life started from these, but I think they definitely tell us how life has [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2708.7999999999997s)]
*  differentiated in a way that we haven't seen before. Just how you can end up with a eukaryotic branch. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  So, okay, so that's like something that happens after you've already differentiated into bacteria, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2723.84s)]
*  and archaea and other things. Yeah. Oh, you want me to go back to like non-life to there is life. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2731.1200000000003s)]
*  Why not? We're getting late in the podcast. Why not? I know I talk about it in the book. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2738.2400000000002s)]
*  It's something that absolutely fascinates me and I can't stop thinking about it. But at the same [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  time, it's hard to really pick a hypothesis that I like because I wasn't there. We don't know. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2747.2s)]
*  But one thing that I find helpful is to think about thermodynamics, just simply because water, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2752.64s)]
*  for sure, but these gradients seem like there's something that is so important. But it's not just [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2759.52s)]
*  having the free energy. It's also about how quickly that free energy can be released through able [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2766.72s)]
*  to go. Like if that chemical reaction, it may yield you tons of energy and you have a beautiful [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2772.56s)]
*  gradient set up and your free energy is great. But if somebody lights a match and the activation [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2778.64s)]
*  energy is overcome abiotically, that reaction is just going to go. And that's not what life is good [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2785.2s)]
*  at. Life is better at slowing down the process of the process of the process of the process of the [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2793.44s)]
*  life. Life is better at speeding up reactions that are blocked for some kinetically blocks. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2800.4s)]
*  They're going a little bit too slow. Life can speed up those reactions. But there's something [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2809.5200000000004s)]
*  interesting about how life does this. And it gets to the second law of thermodynamics, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2815.6000000000004s)]
*  which means that entropy has to increase in an open system. And so life, it seems, is super, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2820.88s)]
*  super good at making entropy. Just really, really good. And like better than, so if you use the [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2829.12s)]
*  burning match example of like methane and oxygen, like we use methane to heat our houses and that [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2838.08s)]
*  creates a ton of heat, that creates a ton of entropy. But if you take that same squirt of [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2843.2799999999997s)]
*  methane and same amount of oxygen and you feed it to a growing culture of a methanotroph, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2849.8399999999997s)]
*  they're going to make this structure and they're going to make a society. They're going to support [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2855.84s)]
*  other organisms. The total amount of entropy that gets produced by these organisms is going to be so [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2860.64s)]
*  much more than you get from just that flash of heat when you light a match. And so I don't have [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  the answer for how life started. I wish I did. But when I think about it, I just think about this [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2876.4s)]
*  fundamental quality of life in that it stretches out the free energy acquisition from reactions [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2882.96s)]
*  in ways that do a better job of creating opportunities for entropy production than without [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2892.08s)]
*  life, which is not exactly like a pithy little definition of life that you could like put on a [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2898.4s)]
*  bumper sticker. But I think it explains a lot of why life is so complex. I think it's actually a [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2903.76s)]
*  super important point because we said life is not just about having energy. It's about having free [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2910.48s)]
*  energy or gradients or something like that. And now you're saying, and furthermore, it's about [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2915.36s)]
*  having batteries. It's about having energy that doesn't just get released and burned too quickly. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2921.12s)]
*  Life is making use of the slowness to fuel itself. I don't know if life is keeping it slow or speeding [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2927.28s)]
*  it up, but it is certainly generating entropy. Yeah, and it speeds up individual reactions, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2935.6s)]
*  like just something that does have a big activation energy like methane and oxygen, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2941.8399999999997s)]
*  you would need to light a match to have that reaction happen. So it's kind of like it's a [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2945.68s)]
*  catalyst that will make those two things react, but they react much more slowly with more entropy [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2951.2799999999997s)]
*  production than it would if you got over that activation energy with just a flame. I often [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2957.2s)]
*  hear people say life is working against the direction of entropy increasing by making things [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2962.64s)]
*  organized. And I try to tell them, no, no, no, it's parasitic upon entropy increasing. We need [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2969.44s)]
*  entropy to increase. That's what life is. Parasitic. Maybe we're collaborative, though. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2975.12s)]
*  But that's it. It's basically like we need that entropy. I think that it's the opposite of, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2980.64s)]
*  I know that argument that you're talking about, because I've heard people make it as well, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2990.48s)]
*  that we're somehow swimming upstream and we break the laws of thermodynamics. And like, no, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2993.84s)]
*  that's ignoring heat. You're ignoring heat. It's kind of important. Yeah. I mean, there's also. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=2999.12s)]
*  Go ahead. Well, I think that there's sort of like a different definition for entropy in the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3006.72s)]
*  informatics versus in thermodynamics. And so in informatics, it's often used as a measure of just [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3013.68s)]
*  disorder, whereas in thermodynamics, disorder is just a subset of entropy, and it can mean other [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3020.56s)]
*  things as well. Yeah, it's complicated because there's that factor of temperature that comes in [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3026.96s)]
*  there when you try to relate entropy to heat. And it's confusing and people will write books on it, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3031.52s)]
*  and I'm sure they do. But okay, that's an insight on what life is and what it does. And it's [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3036.48s)]
*  certainly borne out by the experience of, I can't believe we didn't use the word yet, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3045.2s)]
*  intra-terrestrials. That's the title of your book. Yes. The little critters. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3050.4s)]
*  Pre-terrestrials. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  Underground. Does it affect your pre-existing credences on different theories about the origin [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3055.76s)]
*  of life? I mean, there's metabolism first and replication first and all these things. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3063.52s)]
*  Yeah, or RNA first. It started with information. That's another idea. And the idea that it's RNA [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3069.2s)]
*  first is based on the fact that our RNA as a molecule kind of does all the different things [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3074.96s)]
*  that we need to in a cell. It's sort of like the pre-differentiated molecule. So I think there's a [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3079.92s)]
*  lot of good possibilities in RNA as the beginning factor. But I think that if you think about life [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3086.32s)]
*  as this entropy producing phenomenon, then you can see the continuum with long life a little more [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3095.2000000000003s)]
*  easily. Because we have organized structures. If you're going to make our straw man argument that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3101.6s)]
*  I think we both disagree with, that life beats entropy, beats the law of thermodynamics because [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3107.12s)]
*  it's organized. Look at a whirlpool as a river moves down, a moving river. If there's a rock, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3112.0s)]
*  it's going to create this eddy. And it's a structure. You can see it. There's boundaries [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3119.44s)]
*  to it. You can say what's in the eddy and what's not in the eddy. But none of those water molecules [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3124.24s)]
*  are alive and they're not talking to each other. They're just obeying the second law of thermodynamics. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3130.8s)]
*  They're just like increasing entropy in a way that they have to. And so life is kind of doing [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3135.44s)]
*  that too. It's just we are, you know, the example that I write in my book is that we do the same [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3141.6s)]
*  thing. We're making eddies in the stream except we realize that we can make a white water rafting [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3148.4s)]
*  company based on those eddies. And so we work within the, we dam the stream upstream of it [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3154.16s)]
*  and work with the people controlling the spillover to make sure we have just the right eddy. And then [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3160.7999999999997s)]
*  we build ourselves a boat so we can have a great time like flipping in and out of the whirlpool. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3165.2799999999997s)]
*  So, you know, think of all the entropy that's produced there when you buy the photo that they [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3169.76s)]
*  shoot of your family going through this whirlpool. You know, just we are so good at creating [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3175.1200000000003s)]
*  opportunities for further entropy production that are so much bigger than what was there. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3182.5600000000004s)]
*  And that to me defines the cutoff between life and non-life because when is it? An RNA molecule is [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3188.0s)]
*  not alive. An RNA world wouldn't have really been life. You know, people can replicate [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3196.24s)]
*  nucleic acids in a laboratory bench and nobody says that they're God and created life. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3202.08s)]
*  But to me it's got to have that feature of making extra opportunities for entropy. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3208.56s)]
*  HOFFMAN I don't have any dog in the fight about the origin of life, but I know that, you know, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3213.12s)]
*  there are those who, the metabolism first folks who say that, yeah, this sort of complicated [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3216.9599999999996s)]
*  network of chemical reactions that is increasing entropy came first and later it figured out how [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3223.52s)]
*  to replicate itself using RNA. And that sounds like that's quite a miracle occurring there. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3229.04s)]
*  But then the RNA folks say, well, there's RNA and they figured out how to put themselves in [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3234.32s)]
*  a compartment and build an engine and repair themselves. And like that's also kind of a [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3238.88s)]
*  miracle occurring. So I don't actually know what to think. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3242.72s)]
*  KELSEY Yeah, I mean, in some ways I think it's a little bit of a philosophy question. What do you [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3245.36s)]
*  consider to be alive? You know, I think we can all agree that a whirlpool is not alive, but I [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3251.28s)]
*  think we can also see that thermodynamically it's on the continuum with life. So where do we draw [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3255.6800000000003s)]
*  that line? And that's just, that's for our own hearts to decide. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3261.1200000000003s)]
*  HOFFMAN That's perfectly fair. But there is, once we draw that line, there's an answer to the question, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3267.52s)]
*  literally, where did life start? Do you think that there's some chance that life started deep [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3275.2000000000003s)]
*  below the surface? Or is that just life is so good at taking advantage of opportunities that [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3280.88s)]
*  it eventually drifted down there? KELSEY Yeah, so either one is possible. I want to say clearly, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3287.6800000000003s)]
*  like, I don't know, obviously, no one really knows. But, and I know this sounds a little on [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3293.12s)]
*  the nose because I'm a deep subsurface researcher, but I think the deep subsurface is a great place [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3298.48s)]
*  to form life. I mean, if you think about energy gradients at the surface, they're really harsh, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3302.2400000000002s)]
*  they're really extreme. I mean, we have found all sorts of ways to mitigate the damaging effects of [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3307.76s)]
*  our energy gradients up at the surface. We, our skin makes protectants, we put sunscreen on, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3314.0s)]
*  you know, we need to protect ourselves from, from this high blast of, of energy we get from the sun [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3321.2000000000003s)]
*  and oxygen, the same thing. If we didn't have enzymes running around detoxifying the oxygen [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3326.8s)]
*  that we're dependent upon, we wouldn't be able to live in this high oxygen environment that we, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3332.0s)]
*  that we do. But in the subsurface, things are slower, the gradients are more varied, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3336.24s)]
*  you do have some high energy gradients, but they're never going to be like sunlight high energy. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3341.52s)]
*  And so you do, I mean, I guess maybe this is an argument for the metabolism first camp, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3346.3199999999997s)]
*  you get all of these overlapping energy gradients. And so you can imagine these networks [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3351.12s)]
*  sort of forming in a way that they would just get blasted out energetically and possibly physically [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3356.24s)]
*  by impacts from other celestial objects. I actually, I like this. I don't think you've [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3363.28s)]
*  ever thought of it this way before that here on the surface, there's a lot of resources for life, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3369.76s)]
*  but there's also a lot of dangers. And so you might think that all the resources are so abundant that [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3376.32s)]
*  maybe this is where life began, but you got to it when you're a primitive life form and you haven't [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3380.88s)]
*  accumulated all those defense mechanisms that the dangers are really important. So maybe like [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3386.7200000000003s)]
*  the slow world down beneath the surface where you have time to develop some structure [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3391.36s)]
*  would be a good place to look for the origin of life. Yeah, it's like a nursery. You know, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3397.6800000000003s)]
*  you can take somebody who's going to be like a fantastic leader of a nation, but they can't, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3403.04s)]
*  they're not going to do it when they're three months old. Right. They got to figure out how to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3408.0s)]
*  like eat first. Does that have implications for looking for life elsewhere? I know you've already [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3412.08s)]
*  mentioned Mars. I told you we'd get back to Mars. So Mars, Titan, Europa, wherever, like is this [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3420.64s)]
*  opening up possibilities that the astronomers or the NASA folks haven't really taken seriously yet? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3427.2s)]
*  I wouldn't say they're not taking it seriously. I think people are, well, I hope people are pretty [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3435.44s)]
*  well aware that even though we don't see evidence for a lot of abundant life at the surfaces of [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3439.7599999999998s)]
*  these extraterrestrial bodies, planetary type bodies, their subsurfaces are definitely fair game, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3444.56s)]
*  especially Europa. Why actually I wouldn't put anyone over the other because Europa has [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3452.0s)]
*  liquid oceans underneath the ice cap. This is very well known. This is very, very well established. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3459.36s)]
*  And so when I hear liquid ocean, I just think there's got to be energy gradients that are [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3466.64s)]
*  exploitable by something. So I would be shocked if we didn't find life on Europa. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3472.88s)]
*  And Mars too doesn't have these modern liquid oceans, but it does have these really evocative [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3477.6s)]
*  whiffs of methane that show up every now and then. That used to be very controversial, but now that [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3483.6800000000003s)]
*  we have better monitoring, like they're real, like there are methane whiffs that appear every now and [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3489.12s)]
*  then. It doesn't mean that there's life, but if there was life underground, that is absolutely [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3494.8s)]
*  what I would expect to see in their atmosphere. Maybe say more about the methane whiffs. Is this [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3500.08s)]
*  like a sort of volcanic kind of thing? Could be. Their volcanoes have been dead for a while, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3504.88s)]
*  and they're really just in one place. The really big difference between the subsurface of Mars and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3511.52s)]
*  Earth is that we have plate tectonics, and as far as we can tell, they never really did. That's why [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3516.16s)]
*  they have the biggest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on the Tharsis Plateau, and that's [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3521.6s)]
*  so big because nothing ever moved across it. It's just been blebbing up for a long time. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3527.68s)]
*  But I don't see why that couldn't support subsurface life just the same way that our [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3533.6s)]
*  volcanoes do on Earth. You don't necessarily need plate tectonics, I think, to support subsurface [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3537.44s)]
*  life. The fact that methane is so great because so many of the reactions that we know about that [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3543.36s)]
*  happen on their own without sunlight on Earth create hydrogen and carbon dioxide and formate, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3551.44s)]
*  and these are the chemicals that are pretty much all these methanogens need to make energy. Of [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3558.0s)]
*  course, then they need things like metals and nitrogen and oxygen to put their bodies together, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3564.64s)]
*  but that stuff is all on Mars. That stuff is not as hard of a question to answer. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3568.96s)]
*  I mean, there's still the huge question of how difficult is it to make that first leap into [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3573.28s)]
*  life? You're making a persuasive case that the conditions on Mars or Europa allow for life to [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3578.48s)]
*  exist, but it had to start somewhere. I have no opinion about whether or not that's easy or hard. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3585.36s)]
*  Well, it could have started in one of our two planets between Mars and Earth and transferred. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3592.72s)]
*  We get rocks from Mars all the time, and they could have life on them that seeded Earth, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3599.2s)]
*  so that's definitely a possibility. Is there any chance in... Well, there's this idea that has been [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3603.92s)]
*  floated of a shadow biosphere that there could be at least living organisms that are not related to [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3610.08s)]
*  all the other living organisms. It sounds like that's not what you're seeing. No, that's absolutely [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3617.44s)]
*  possible. Okay. For sure. But you haven't seen any yet. You don't have any evidence. I haven't seen [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3623.84s)]
*  any, but the methods that I use to look for life would miss them. Okay. So when I go looking for [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3629.92s)]
*  life in weird places, I use DNA. So if you have a shadow biosphere that doesn't use DNA, I would [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3636.4s)]
*  miss it with my methods. Okay. But if... That's still on the table. Would you be able to find [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3642.8s)]
*  something that had the wrong chirality of amino acids? Yes, I would. Yes. If I'm using the right... [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3649.6s)]
*  I mean, that's not a technique that I do all the time. It's only to ask a specific question, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3660.16s)]
*  but yeah, we could see... We can detect proteins that are made from amino acids that would have [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3665.36s)]
*  the wrong chirality. Okay. And we haven't found any yet, or you would have told me. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3671.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. But like I said, in terms of the real exploration, discovering new things, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3676.8s)]
*  that tends to happen through DNA. It tends not to happen through looking at other molecules. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3684.88s)]
*  Okay. That's true. So it might be there is what you're saying. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3691.6000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. All right. Yeah. 100%. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3695.44s)]
*  I will look out for the news alerts. Which I think is fascinating. I mean, I think it's... [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3698.32s)]
*  If there's one thing I've learned from this career adventure that I've been on is that there can be [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3703.36s)]
*  stuff out in nature that you never would have imagined existed, and you have to be open to [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3708.8s)]
*  finding it. Yeah. No, no, no. And you made a good case also that we haven't explored much of what [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3713.76s)]
*  is down there yet. That's right. Yeah. It's all on the table. In the theme that everything is [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3718.96s)]
*  connected and all life is connected. Is there traffic between the subsurface life and the [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3727.92s)]
*  surface world? Do they rely on each other or notice each other at all? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3734.56s)]
*  Sometimes. The answer is always yes to all the possibilities that you just presented. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3740.32s)]
*  Some of them, like these ones that are buried in marine sediments, as far as we know, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3746.88s)]
*  they're totally dependent on the stuff that we produced in our rivers and ran off and [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3751.52s)]
*  fell down from the phytoplankton in the open ocean. We think that that is what's supporting [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3758.08s)]
*  those communities. And so they are. They are dependent on our detritus. They're dependent [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3762.88s)]
*  on our leftovers and our trash. But the ones that are using the energy gradients that happen, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3766.88s)]
*  whether we influence it or not, would not be dependent on any of that stuff coming down. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3773.6s)]
*  Okay. And there's probably a mixture of both types in almost every ecosystem. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3779.04s)]
*  We do have an effect on the world in various ways, trash included. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3782.88s)]
*  We definitely matter. Sometimes our trash is good. They like our trash. And they come back up to us [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3786.64s)]
*  too. They're basically determining what's happening with our redox state of our crust. And the redox [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3792.96s)]
*  state of our crust determines our mineral deposits. It determines how much oxygen is available in the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3800.0s)]
*  atmosphere. So in terms of how they affect us, you can't underestimate the importance of these [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3806.08s)]
*  organisms on us over the course of Earth's history. They have made the world that we now use. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3811.92s)]
*  Is there any chance we could put them to work further? I know that we're messing with our [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3818.96s)]
*  climate in sort of dangerous ways. Is that something people have wondered? We could eat up [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3823.84s)]
*  the extra CO2 in the atmosphere or something? Yeah, it sounds kind of crazy, but they could [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3828.7200000000003s)]
*  actually do that for us. If you think about, if you really take our climate problem down to like [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3834.08s)]
*  its sort of dumbest explanation, there was a lot of carbon in Earth's crust. Humans, because we're [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3839.68s)]
*  great at producing entropy, took all that carbon from fossil fuels and natural gas and we are [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3846.96s)]
*  putting it into the atmosphere and that is causing an imbalance that is causing problems for us. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3852.8799999999997s)]
*  So putting that carbon back down underground makes a lot of sense. That's just in some ways reversing [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3858.08s)]
*  what we've done. We can't just like make fossil fuels out of it, but we could maybe stick it [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3863.8399999999997s)]
*  underground. And so that is happening. Iceland has a company that is doing this. They're capturing [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3868.72s)]
*  CO2 out of an energy production plant and piping it underground. And it seems to be working a [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3876.16s)]
*  little bit. They also did this in Louisiana, one of these test wells, and that caused some problems [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3882.3999999999996s)]
*  because it's not just like an empty Tupperware container that they're sticking this carbon down [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3888.72s)]
*  into. There's things living down there. That's what we're learning about the interterrestrials. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3894.24s)]
*  And some of these wells are producing methane out of it, which is not what we want because that's [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3898.0s)]
*  not actually going to sequester the carbon. Yeah, it doesn't help. Yeah. Okay. So we don't know. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3903.92s)]
*  That is something that I think that our field can be very helpful for going forward is if for any [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3911.2s)]
*  technology that is trying to sequester carbon and draw down CO2 in the atmosphere by sticking it [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3917.68s)]
*  underground, call up a microbiologist before you do that and make sure that it's actually going to [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3923.76s)]
*  stay there. Very good point. Call up your local microbiologist. Yeah, we can start doing extension [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3927.92s)]
*  work. So for the final question, let's imagine that we're in a happy world where science is [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3934.1600000000003s)]
*  extraordinarily well supported by society and you can imagine the experiment or experiments you want [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3942.96s)]
*  to do. I mean, again, I think you have a compelling case. There's a whole bunch of [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3949.68s)]
*  living critters under the ground that we don't know anything about. That's something we can go [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3953.04s)]
*  look for. What would we do? How would we actually experimentally or observationally [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3956.56s)]
*  learn more about these things that we're not doing now? I think we need to attach ourselves to a lot [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3962.88s)]
*  more drilling. That is the most expensive way that we have of getting down. And so we do talk to [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3968.08s)]
*  companies. There's a lot of different companies in oil and gas and in mining who are excited to [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3975.12s)]
*  have scientists learn what they can and that's been incredibly helpful to our field. But just [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3981.6s)]
*  being able to direct the drilling ourselves. Drilling a borehole costs a million to $10 million. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3986.4s)]
*  So that's something that needs an actual investment. It's often an international [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3993.7599999999998s)]
*  investment, but that is absolutely the thing I would say is we need to go down. We need to be [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=3997.3599999999997s)]
*  able to control the places that we drill and the things we drill into, which we have been able to [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4002.4s)]
*  in the past. And I don't want to be flipping about this. Getting these drilling proposals funded is [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4010.7200000000003s)]
*  highly competitive. You have to be really good and really know what you're doing to get one of [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4016.8s)]
*  these projects. So it's not like we were being willy-nilly, but now that program is over in the [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4021.6800000000003s)]
*  United States. We don't do that anymore. Is there at least a feeling in the field that things are [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4026.88s)]
*  taking off? That this is a new exciting area? Do people recognize this? Yeah, absolutely. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4033.76s)]
*  Within those of us who are studying this, I cannot overemphasize the majesty of these two groups who [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4040.0s)]
*  have managed to culture these guys. I really didn't think it was possible. Not that I would say that. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4049.04s)]
*  I really didn't know if it was possible, but the fact that they've managed to do it has really [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4054.48s)]
*  changed my view of how we can interact with these organisms. And it turns out we can actually [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4059.6s)]
*  do more with them than I ever would have thought possible. And we need more of that. So we just [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4066.0s)]
*  need to replicate what they're doing and get the rest of these things in culture and start studying [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4071.2s)]
*  all of these things. That's going to take a huge effort. And you promise along the way not to [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4075.36s)]
*  release a new pathogen that will wipe out all eukaryotic life on Earth? Promise is a big word. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4080.8s)]
*  Plan. There's an interesting, in terms of fears on that notion, I don't know if you know this about [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4089.2000000000003s)]
*  archaea, but that entire domain of life has no pathogens. It's one of the greatest mysteries [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4095.36s)]
*  of archaea. They commensal. They live in our guts. They're with us all the time. And for whatever [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4100.72s)]
*  reason, they've never decided to take advantage of us. So viruses and bacteria, obviously like [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4105.52s)]
*  super pathogenic in the wrong forms, but archaea just like right along in their chill. Yeah, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4111.360000000001s)]
*  they just, you know, they're lovers, not fighters. All right, don't let them know that they're going [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4118.4800000000005s)]
*  to start exploiting this loophole that they didn't look into before. But exactly, Karen Lloyd, thanks [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4124.0s)]
*  so much for being on the Mindscape podcast. Yeah, thank you so much for having you. Interesting [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4128.96s)]
*  conversation. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3VxkP5IMQ&t=4133.44s)]
