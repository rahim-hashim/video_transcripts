It's the end of the year, and time for our annual holiday break here at Mindscape. But as usual, we wrap up with a Holiday Message. This year, inspired by Joni Mitchell's "Hits" and "Misses" albums, I go through my scientific papers and talk about some of my favorites -- some of which were hits, in terms of making an impact on subsequent research, and some of which were misses by that standard. But I love them all! It's an excuse to talk about process -- how papers come to be, from the initial informal idea to sitting down and doing the work.

Here are the papers I discuss in the episode.

# Mindscape Holiday Message 2024  Hits and Misses
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=0.0s)]
*  Not sure if I've ever mentioned it before, but one of my favorite singer-songwriters is Joni [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3.6s)]
*  Mitchell, who everyone knows, of course, both because the singing and the songwriting are very [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=8.8s)]
*  good, but also the spirit. I like the way that Joni Mitchell approaches being a musician, being [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=14.56s)]
*  creative, and also dealing with the weirdness and nastiness of the music industry. I'll give you two [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=20.64s)]
*  examples. One is there's a wonderful interview that I saw with her from the 70s where the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=26.08s)]
*  interviewer said, I heard that you were mentioned as the female Bob Dylan, but you were not impressed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  with that. You didn't like that comparison. Why not? He's great. And Joni Mitchell instantly says, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=38.0s)]
*  have you ever heard him sing? Which I thought was very funny because they are, in fact, close [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=42.8s)]
*  friends or at least have been. The other is that after getting her start in the 60s and then having [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=48.4s)]
*  a lot of hit singles in the 70s, in the 80s, Joni Mitchell, of course, was told by her record [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=54.0s)]
*  company, it is time for a greatest hits album. And she said, well, my favorite songs are not [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=59.52s)]
*  necessarily the ones that sold the most copies that were the biggest hits. So why don't we have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=66.32s)]
*  an album that is just my favorite songs that some of them are hits, some of them are not? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=71.36s)]
*  The record company said no. And apparently the compromise, who knows how much of this story is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=75.68s)]
*  accurate, but the compromise was they came out with two albums, one called Hits and the other [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=80.88s)]
*  called Misses. And the idea here is very, very important to emphasize that it's not that the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=86.0s)]
*  Misses were bad songs. It's the songs that Joni Mitchell herself had great fondness for. She really [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  liked them. But for whatever reason, they didn't become as popular as the others. I love this idea. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=99.12s)]
*  And it came to mind when I was thinking about the podcast you're listening to right now, which is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=104.96s)]
*  the annual Holiday Message. The Holiday Message is an unnumbered bonus episode. It's supposed to be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=109.76s)]
*  short. They never end up being short. Sorry about that. But the original idea was maybe I would talk [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  about what had happened during the year or whatever. But the year in Mindscape is always very, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  very eclectic and different. It's hard to find a small set of grand lessons to draw. So instead, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=126.0s)]
*  I've just been using it as sort of a free for all, something that is more frivolous and informal [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=131.84s)]
*  than a typical solo episode, but basically a mini solo episode. And I thought about this when [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=136.24s)]
*  thinking about the last podcast with Mike Wong, where he told a very charming story about the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  origin of this paper that was the inspiration for our episode, the paper about functional [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=148.8s)]
*  information and so forth, and how it came out of this group of people who were talking to each other. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=153.28s)]
*  And it made me remember, I've said this before, but it is, I get a lot of questions about how a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  paper comes to be, right? How a certain idea comes out, how it shapes itself into an actual [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=165.12s)]
*  publication. In physics, that's the currency that we work in, right? We write papers. You don't [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=170.24s)]
*  write books anymore in physics. You can write books, but those are not the academic products [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=175.68s)]
*  that people care about. Let's put it that way. It's the papers that you have, especially in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=182.0s)]
*  refereed journals, that people care about. So your goal is to write papers with good new physics [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=185.52s)]
*  ideas. So where do the ideas come from? How do you massage them into the shape that they're a paper? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=191.44s)]
*  How do you get them published? How do you decide who to work with, what co-authors, what to include, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=197.68s)]
*  when to publish, all those questions, right? And so I thought at first of maybe like picking out a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=202.24s)]
*  favorite paper and talking about that, but then I have too many favorites. So I thought instead, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=207.2s)]
*  since it's the holidays and I have a little bit of time, we'll do the hits or misses [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=212.24s)]
*  paradigm. And I will walk through some number, you know, let's put it this way. I'm going to talk [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  about far fewer papers than I wanted to talk about. I now know how the rock star feels who is forced [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=222.08s)]
*  to confront coming up with a listing for their greatest hits album. You know, there's always [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=227.84s)]
*  going to be edge cases. We're like, why is this one on there and not that one, right? But okay, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=233.84s)]
*  we're going to talk about various papers that are both hits or misses in my scientific career. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Again, it's the holiday message. I can be as self-indulgent as I want. And again, again, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=243.68s)]
*  the idea is that I'm not going to talk about papers that didn't work out that, you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=248.72s)]
*  sometimes you write a paper, then you're like, why did I spend so much time doing that? But other [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=252.96s)]
*  times you write a paper and go like, no, I really, I really like this one. This is really good, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  but nevertheless, it doesn't make an impact. So making an impact matters. I'm not against [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=260.32s)]
*  making an impact. I'm someone who absolutely believes that you should aspire not just to have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=265.12s)]
*  true ideas, but to help other people understand those true ideas and have them be shared out [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=269.76s)]
*  there in the world. And in the way that scientific publishing works, that is quantified by how many [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=276.0s)]
*  people are citing your paper. I don't think it's bad to hope that people cite your papers. I think [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=281.28s)]
*  that that's part of the point of being a working scientist. So it does, however, help you quantify [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=285.92s)]
*  whether those papers have been hits or misses. So we're going to go through some examples of both. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=290.88s)]
*  And as always, I want to thank everyone for spending the year here with Mindscape. It's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=295.84s)]
*  been quite a ride. I'm always looking back over the people who appear during the year, and I'm [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=301.11999999999995s)]
*  very impressed at the people I've been able to get on the podcast. This is the first year where [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=305.67999999999995s)]
*  we've had someone on the podcast and a couple months later, they won the Nobel Prize. That was [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=312.64s)]
*  Daron Osomoglu, but we've had MacArthur prizes. We've had Oscars. The Daniels won an Oscar after [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=316.88s)]
*  appearing on Mindscape. So we've been doing pretty well. And the audience matters just as much as [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=323.28s)]
*  the guests. So thank you, all of you. I hope you had a good 2024 and even better in 2025. Let's go. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  My first ever published paper came out in 1990. It was not the first paper that I started writing, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=335.76s)]
*  but as would turn out to be true throughout my career, I'm very slow sometimes. So I had a paper [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=357.68s)]
*  that I worked on as an undergraduate on modeling an eclipsing binary star, Epsilon Araigi. Eventually, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=364.4s)]
*  we got a paper out about that in 1991. But by that time, I had already had another paper [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=370.88s)]
*  from my grad school days. My first ever published paper was called Limits on a Lorentz and Parody [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  Violating Modification of Electrodynamics that I wrote with George Field and Roman Chiquiv. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=383.12s)]
*  Now, this is a weird collaboration in some ways. Roman Chiquiv was a very accomplished [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=388.96s)]
*  quantum field theorist and theoretical physicist, one of the pioneers of the idea of anomalies [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=395.68s)]
*  in gauge theories, sometimes called Adler-Bell-Yaciv anomalies after Steven Adler and John Bell, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=400.88s)]
*  as well as Roman, who helped invent them. He also did a lot of work on the vacuum state of QCD [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=408.24s)]
*  and other ideas in, let us call it, mathematical physics. Roman loved to, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  he wasn't a mathematician, he didn't try to prove theorems or anything like that, but he loved to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=420.32s)]
*  take new mathematical ideas and see how you could apply them in interesting physics contexts. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=423.76s)]
*  Sometimes it paid off, right? It turns out, oh, it's actually super important for this or that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  physical application. Other times it was just kind of a cute math trick. That's how science goes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  sometimes. And George Field, of course, was my advisor, was my PhD advisor. So we have to set [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=438.32s)]
*  the stage a little bit here. I was an undergraduate at Villanova and Villanova had no graduate school, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=444.32s)]
*  no one there was interested in the kind of things I was interested in. I was always interested in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=452.24s)]
*  fundamental physics, particle physics, cosmology, gravity, on the theoretical side of things. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  It was not a hotbed of that kind of research at Villanova. I applied to top-notch places to go, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=460.96s)]
*  some places just blatantly turned me down, Princeton, and Harvard turned me down. They [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=467.36s)]
*  literally said that Villanova was just not up to snuff, that they'd never accepted someone from [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  Villanova and weren't sure that I could hack it. But then I, these were the physics departments, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=479.36s)]
*  I was awarded an NSF fellowship and managed to use that to parlay my way into an acceptance in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=485.6s)]
*  the astronomy department. So the reason I'm telling you this is just to know that all along, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=490.88s)]
*  I knew what I wanted to do was theoretical physics. But I found myself in an astronomy [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=495.52s)]
*  department because I figured Harvard's a great place, there's lots of great resources there, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=499.28s)]
*  and I was somewhat correct. It definitely hurt me not to be surrounded by other physics graduate [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=502.96s)]
*  students, etc. It's a different kind of vibe, right? But to some extent, I've overcome that. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=507.84s)]
*  But anyway, the point is, you are randomly assigned an advisor when you get to the astronomy [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=514.16s)]
*  department at Harvard, and I was randomly assigned to George. George passed away this year, I wrote [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  a little bit about that on my blog if you want to read about it. He was a huge figure in my life, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=524.56s)]
*  one of the most influential people for me and a truly wonderful, wonderful person. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=529.52s)]
*  So I got lucky because it was a completely random assignment of advisor and student. There just [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=533.68s)]
*  weren't any people in the Harvard astronomy department doing what you might call quantum [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=539.28s)]
*  field theory particle physics-y kinds of cosmology. George was the closest, and he was closest for a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=544.88s)]
*  very interesting reason. George was a theoretical astrophysicist, but his biggest work was in the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=550.32s)]
*  interstellar medium and atomic and molecular physics and things like that, magnetic fields, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=557.2s)]
*  real astrophysics, right? Gastrophysics, if you want to put it that way. He was stolen away from [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=562.48s)]
*  Berkeley by Harvard in the 1970s to be the first director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=567.2s)]
*  Astrophysics. And at some point in the 80s, he stepped down from that and was sort of thinking [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=573.04s)]
*  about what research to do. He was always a restless intellectual person. He wanted to do [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=578.24s)]
*  something new. And he saw in the mid-1980s that there's a lot of excitement about particle physics [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=582.72s)]
*  and the early universe. So he said, well, I don't know anything about that. I will try to learn [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=588.4s)]
*  something about that. So in his very unique way, he was a student at a summer school in particle [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=592.0s)]
*  physics, the famously Lesouche summer schools, which I went to myself many years later. And [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=598.96s)]
*  he went as a student to this summer school. So he was surrounded by a bunch of other graduate [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=605.68s)]
*  students and himself, a senior theoretical astrophysicist. And he sat on a bunch of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=610.4s)]
*  lectures. And one of the lecturers was Roman Shakiv. And this was just before I got to grad [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=614.88s)]
*  school. And so Roman at the time was very interested in electromagnetism and gauge theories more [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=619.52s)]
*  generally in three-dimensional spacetimes. Okay, so two plus one dimensions, two dimensions of space, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=625.76s)]
*  one dimension of time, flat land. Although if it's gravity, then gravity will make it curved land, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=631.76s)]
*  but still a plane topologically. And it turns out there's, you know, in the spirit of Roman [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  Shakiv, there's a bunch of interesting mathematical things you can do if you imagine that you're doing [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=644.16s)]
*  electromagnetism in three dimensions instead of the four dimensions of the real world. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=648.96s)]
*  In particular, there are mathematical objects that naturally live in manifolds that are odd [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=653.84s)]
*  dimensional. So like three dimensional, for example, or five or seven, but not the four [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=661.04s)]
*  dimensions of the real world. And the most famous of these is the churn Simon's term invented by [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=666.0s)]
*  SS churn and of course, Jim Simons, who later left mathematics to found Renaissance technologies [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=672.64s)]
*  became extremely rich and started the Simons Foundation. Okay, so there's a lot of fun [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=677.92s)]
*  connections all over the place. So Roman had been working with his friends, Stanley Dessar and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  Gerard de Tuft on churn Simon's electromagnetism in two plus one dimensions. Now you can imagine [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=688.32s)]
*  being a condensed matter physicist in the sort of confining things to a plane by using some material [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=694.88s)]
*  substrate. And that would be a place where maybe churn Simon's electromagnetism would be relevant, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=701.84s)]
*  or you can imagine being a string theorist and having a two dimensional brain or something like [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=706.96s)]
*  that. But it was Roman didn't care. He was just interested in what would happen if you just let [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=711.12s)]
*  your imagination roam freely. George, on the other hand, as a student was the down to earth [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=715.2s)]
*  astrophysicist was like, why are we doing this? The world is four dimensional space time is three [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=719.76s)]
*  plus one dimensional, how could you do something like this? In the real world? That was his [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=724.24s)]
*  insistent question. And Roman was, you can't do that. It just doesn't exist. And then but eventually, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=730.48s)]
*  because they're both very smart people, they realize there's a way to kind of do something like [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  it. But the point is, you have to violate Lorentz invariance. That is to say, you have to pick out a [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=741.28s)]
*  preferred frame of reference in the universe with respect to which you can measure your velocity, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=747.68s)]
*  you know, in contradiction to the Michelson-Morley experiment and all the foundations of special [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  relativity that Einstein sat on. But it was a very clever way of violating electro dynamics, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=759.76s)]
*  so a lot of violating Lorentz invariance, sorry. The idea being that, you know, in three dimensional [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=765.68s)]
*  space around you, part of Lorentz invariance is rotational invariance, you know, all of the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=770.48s)]
*  different directions in space are created equal. If you draw a plane, right, a two dimensional surface [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  embedded in this three dimensional space, you have to pick an orientation for the plane. So voila, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=780.96s)]
*  you have violated rotational invariance, which is part of Lorentz invariance. So you can do the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=786.0s)]
*  four dimensional version of that. And you can even do it in a relatively mild way. And this gets into [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=790.24s)]
*  mathematical niceties about invariance versus covariance and whatever, you don't have to worry [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=796.24s)]
*  about it. But the point is, you can sort of still imagine a three plus one dimensional version of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=800.24s)]
*  Chern-Simon's electromagnetism that picks out a preferred direction in space-time but doesn't do [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=807.36s)]
*  anything else bad. In other words, it doesn't violate gauge invariance or it doesn't, you know, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=812.8s)]
*  make energies unbounded below or anything like that, okay? It's relatively well behaved in a [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=819.2s)]
*  whole bunch of ways. And basically what you're doing is taking a parameter that exists in the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=824.56s)]
*  three dimensional theory and making it a vector instead of a number, a mass scale, it is now a [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=830.0s)]
*  vector with a direction in space-time in the Lorentz violating theory. And then you imagine that this [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=835.28s)]
*  vector field fills all of space and is constant, okay? So it's a vector field that is just the same [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=840.4799999999999s)]
*  direction everywhere throughout space interacting with the electromagnetic field that we know and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=847.5999999999999s)]
*  love in a very straightforward way. And I think that George really at the time was not thinking [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=852.72s)]
*  about the deep implications for Lorentz invariance and whatever. From his perspective, you had some [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=858.88s)]
*  new equations, you had a modification of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and that kind of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=863.52s)]
*  thing just makes the theoretical physicist so happy because it's full employment. Every homework set [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=870.1600000000001s)]
*  that you ever did in electromagnetism when you took the class, you can now redo with this new [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=876.64s)]
*  version of electromagnetism. To some people this sounds horrible, to other people it sounds like [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=882.8s)]
*  the most fun ever. So George sat down and got, you know, plane wave solutions and dynamo solutions [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=887.52s)]
*  for this modified version of electromagnetism and so forth. And that is exactly when I came on the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=893.52s)]
*  scene. George had sort of played around with these equations and both George and Romand had come back [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=898.48s)]
*  to Cambridge, Massachusetts where both Harvard and MIT are located and they said let's keep talking [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=903.28s)]
*  about this. Maybe there's something interesting to do. So I met with them as the new grad student. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=908.64s)]
*  George basically said, you know, why don't you come along and listen to us talk? Maybe it'll turn into [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=913.52s)]
*  something. And what we realized was, mostly George realized this, there is a way to experimentally [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=917.52s)]
*  test this idea of violating the Lorentz invariance in this particular way because it would call, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  it would cause what we now call cosmic birefringence. I talked about this before [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=931.44s)]
*  on the podcast, the screwy universe idea. A photon interacting with this vector field, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  stretching throughout all the universe, would rotate its polarization. And if only you knew [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  the direction of polarization when it left the distant source, you would be able to tell how [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=948.4000000000001s)]
*  much it rotated by. And George was enough of a real astronomer to know there were radio galaxies [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  who had magnetic fields stretched along the direction of a jet and they would be polarized [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=957.68s)]
*  perpendicularly to the jet and you could take a picture of the jet and then take a picture of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=963.68s)]
*  the polarization and compare them. Are they at 90 degrees or not? So that's where I come in as the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=968.2399999999999s)]
*  new young student. You know, I don't recommend if you want to become a theoretical physicist doing [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=973.8399999999999s)]
*  things like quantum field theory or gravity or cosmology to go to an undergraduate institution [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  that doesn't have any graduate classes. It was always a story of catching up for me because I [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=986.96s)]
*  didn't take quantum field theory until my second year in grad school, which is much later than [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=995.28s)]
*  people take it nowadays. If you're a good undergraduate, you'll take quantum field theory [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=999.12s)]
*  in your senior year as an undergraduate generally. So I was lost a lot of the mathematical manipulations [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1003.68s)]
*  going on. I had to pick up the lingo, et cetera, but what I could do was collect the data. Now, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1011.76s)]
*  I don't mean collect the data in the sense of going out to the telescope. I mean going to the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1017.6s)]
*  library where you would pick out a paper version of the astrophysical journal, bring it to the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1020.88s)]
*  Xerox machine, photocopy it, and then go to your computer and type in the tables of data that other [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1027.28s)]
*  people had collected. So what I was doing was looking at polarization data, position angles, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1033.52s)]
*  and of course the distance, the redshift for various radio galaxies that I was able to find. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1039.2s)]
*  And then I could do a little bit of something slightly more scientific, which is to do the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1044.16s)]
*  statistical analysis on how good a fit is it if a vector is zero or if the vector is big, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1047.68s)]
*  what are the restrictions we could put on it? And the answer is we can put on very, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1055.2s)]
*  very good restrictions. So we wrote a paper. None of us, neither George nor Roman or I, thought [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1058.4s)]
*  anyone would care about this paper because who wants to violate the Renssen variance, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1063.52s)]
*  What all of us had failed to take into consideration is precisely that joy of playing [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1068.16s)]
*  with new equations that physicists have. So that paper, as far as I know, that paper, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1073.28s)]
*  other people had absolutely looked at can you violate the Renssen variance and how can you [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1078.88s)]
*  experimentally test it? But we basically pioneered a new way of doing that based on terms in a [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1083.0400000000002s)]
*  Lagrangian, the Lagrangian being the foundational thing you write down when you define a quantum [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1090.48s)]
*  field theory. So this was guaranteed to be otherwise relatively well behaved. There's [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1095.44s)]
*  issues, but it's relatively well behaved. And so that opened up a floodgate of possibilities. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1100.96s)]
*  We basically had written a paper about one particular way to violate the Renssen variance, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1108.4s)]
*  but you could then start asking the question, what are the other ways? What is the most general way [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1114.0s)]
*  that you could violate the Renssen variance and coupled all sorts of different fields, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  not just electromagnetism? And then you can ask, how do we experimentally test them? So Alan [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1122.72s)]
*  Costelecki, who was a later collaborator of mine at Indiana University, became the world's expert [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1128.64s)]
*  in this, figuring out all the different ways to violate the Renssen variance and how to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1135.04s)]
*  experimentally test them. And this idea led to new experimental tests that otherwise wouldn't have [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1138.48s)]
*  been done. So we got a lot of citations out of that one. That was a hit. And it was a hit mostly [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1145.2s)]
*  because we opened up new possibilities. That's a lesson. As much as I can, I'm going to try to [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1149.84s)]
*  give people lessons from the hits and the misses. So the next one I want to talk about was a miss. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1154.32s)]
*  Again, misses are things that I love dearly myself, but for some reason never took off out there in [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1159.52s)]
*  the citationosphere. This is a collection of two papers. One is by myself, Eddie Fari and Alan [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1164.24s)]
*  Guth called An Obstacle to Building a Time Machine. And the other was with Eddie and Alan and myself [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1170.24s)]
*  and also Ken Olem called Energy Momentum Restrictions on the Creation of Got Time Machines. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1176.16s)]
*  So what happened here was a time machine, of course, is just fancy science fiction talk for [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1182.24s)]
*  closed time-like curve in general relativity. The idea of a closed time-like curve was an old one. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1188.0s)]
*  The idea is time-like means you are always moving slower than the speed of light. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1193.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay, in special relativity, where space and time are fixed, you always move slower than the speed [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1198.48s)]
*  of light, you move on a time-like trajectory, and all the time-like trajectories basically move [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1204.16s)]
*  upward in the space-time diagram from the bottom to the top. So going forward in time means going [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  upward in the diagram, that's all she wrote. In general relativity, now that you can curve space [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1216.0s)]
*  and time into each other, you can imagine that the overall geometry of space-time has the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1221.52s)]
*  characteristics that locally you can move on a trajectory that is always moving slower than the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1227.8400000000001s)]
*  speed of light, a well-formed time-like trajectory, but the global geometry of space-time means that [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1232.56s)]
*  you zoom off in some direction and you come back before you left. That would be a closed time-like [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1239.12s)]
*  curve. And the idea here is that it's 100% easy to write down space-time geometries that have that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1245.44s)]
*  property. What we don't know is if they appear in the real world. Does it actually happen, right? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1254.08s)]
*  Can you build a time machine is the question. And around that time, I don't know, sometimes these [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1259.6s)]
*  things just pop up around the early 1990s, this became a semi-hot topic in theoretical physics. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1264.7199999999998s)]
*  This is when Kip Thorne and his friends used wormholes to show that you could make a time machine, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1270.56s)]
*  closed time-like curves, and eventually that led to interstellar and a whole bunch of other things. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1275.36s)]
*  But there was another one, sort of a quirky little paper that Richard Gott, an astrophysicist from [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1279.76s)]
*  Princeton University, came out with where he showed how to construct a space-time with closed time-like [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  curves using cosmic strings. Now cosmic strings are not necessarily known to exist, but theoretically [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1289.68s)]
*  they're very easy to describe. They could be leftover topological defects from the cooling [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1296.48s)]
*  of the early universe, just like you can have fractures in ice or crystals when they cool and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1302.56s)]
*  try to settle into an ordered state. You can have fractures in the universe itself, which would show [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  up as cosmic strings. And you can then go and actually solve Einstein's equation to find what [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1314.0s)]
*  is the gravitational field around a cosmic string. And the answer is super interesting. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1318.8s)]
*  If you have a single cosmic string that is perfectly straight, okay, and remains perfectly [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1323.28s)]
*  straight and infinitely long, then you can stand right next to it, even if it's very, very high [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  energy, and there's no gravitational pull of the string on you. So in other words, in general [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1333.52s)]
*  relativity terms, the space-time outside the cosmic string is perfectly flat. There's no [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1340.0s)]
*  gravitational field. How can that be, you ask, given that you're positing that the cosmic string [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1346.0s)]
*  itself has an enormous amount of energy, and energy creates the curvature of space-time? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1351.44s)]
*  The answer is that there is curvature of space-time, but only exactly at the location [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1355.8400000000001s)]
*  of the cosmic string, not outside. And what that means is the following. Ordinarily, if I have a [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1360.72s)]
*  gyroscope and I carry around, there's a little vector in the gyroscope saying where the axis is [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1366.4s)]
*  around which the gyroscope is rotating. And if you take in flat space-time, if you take a gyroscope [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1372.08s)]
*  and you move it around a circle, it comes back to exactly the position it was in when it left, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1377.04s)]
*  right? And this is actually a mathematical operation called the holonomy of the vector. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1381.76s)]
*  How does it rotate as you travel around a closed loop? If you take that gyroscope and you do a [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1388.24s)]
*  holonomy around the cosmic string, it does not come back to where it started, because basically [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1393.6799999999998s)]
*  it is sensitive not just to the curvature of space-time along its path, but the total [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1399.92s)]
*  amount of curvature of space-time inside the path that it describes as a closed loop. So there is [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1405.52s)]
*  curvature in the space-time. In fact, in much more lowbrow terms, it's a cone. It's a conical [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  singularity in space-time. If you take a big piece of paper and you put a dot on the piece of paper [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  and then you cut a little wedge, a little angle out of the piece of paper that leads to the dot, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1426.16s)]
*  so it's a perfectly two straight sides with an angle in between them. And then if you know [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1431.44s)]
*  general relativity or if you know your differential geometry enough, the intrinsic geometry of the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1438.8000000000002s)]
*  piece of paper, other than at the point where you are at the center of your angle, the intrinsic [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1443.52s)]
*  geometry of the paper is still flat no matter what you do to it. If you crumple it or whatever, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  if you crumple the piece of paper, you're changing its relationship to the outside world, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1452.48s)]
*  but you're not changing its intrinsic geometry, which is still flat. So I can take these two [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1456.08s)]
*  straight lines that I've cut out at an angle from my center point and I can glue them together and [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1461.2s)]
*  the rest of the piece of paper makes a cone. That is the geometry of a cosmic string. It's flat outside [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1466.16s)]
*  and a conical singularity right there. So that's great for theorists because you can basically [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1472.24s)]
*  solve equations exactly when the solutions are that simple. So anyway, what Richard Gott had shown [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1480.48s)]
*  is if I have two infinitely long cosmic strings that are both perfectly straight and they're [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1486.48s)]
*  parallel to each other, but they're moving, they're moving past each other at a super high velocity, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1491.92s)]
*  then you can solve all the equations exactly and you find that there are closed timelike curves in [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1498.16s)]
*  that geometry. So that's the Gott time machine named after Richard Gott. On the one hand, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1502.72s)]
*  super interesting. On the other hand, you absolutely furrow your brow because where in [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1509.76s)]
*  the world are you going to get two cosmic strings that are infinitely long, perfectly straight, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1514.24s)]
*  parallel to each other and moving at high velocity? Well, you know, maybe it's just [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1518.4s)]
*  an approximation to something deeper. So at this time when Gott came out with his paper, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1522.8s)]
*  I was taking some classes at MIT, including a class on quantum field theory and particle physics [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1529.6s)]
*  that Eddie Fahry was teaching. And Eddie was on the lookout for a student to talk to. And so he [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1535.04s)]
*  asked me whether I'd be interested in talking with him about the Gott time machine, like try to [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1541.12s)]
*  understand what it was there. It was very vague at the beginning. It was like, you know, what is [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1546.0s)]
*  going on here? Can we think about it in some clever way? Can we show how to make one or that you can't [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1549.92s)]
*  make one or whatever? And so we tried and we, you know, we made some progress. The super important, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1555.44s)]
*  helpful insight here, and it harkens back to something we said before, is that because the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1562.4s)]
*  cosmic strings are perfectly straight and parallel, nothing happens along the direction of the strings [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1568.32s)]
*  actually extending, right? So in other words, all of the action is basically in the direct in the [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1576.08s)]
*  directions defined by a plane perpendicular to the cosmic strings. In yet other words, the theory of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  perfectly straight parallel cosmic strings in three plus one dimensions is the same as the [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1590.48s)]
*  theory of point particles in two plus one dimensional gravity. So said all over again, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1596.56s)]
*  if you forget about the three plus one dimensional world and just do gravity in two plus one dimensions [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1603.84s)]
*  and ask what is the gravitational field around a point particle, the answer is there's no space [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1609.52s)]
*  time curvature around that point particle, but it deforms the overall space time into a conical [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1614.4s)]
*  shape, which is flat outside, but an overall deficit angle if you make a loop around it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  So we could analyze the whole problem instead of two cosmic strings moving past each other as [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1626.8000000000002s)]
*  two point particles in three dimensions moving past each other, including their gravitational [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1631.68s)]
*  field. So that was very helpful. And we did make progress, but we didn't actually crack the problem. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1636.16s)]
*  And eventually Eddie was talking to his good friend, Alan Guth, Alan, of course, the pioneer [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1641.92s)]
*  of the inflationary cosmology paradigm. And Alan had some very, very good ideas for how to make [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1646.32s)]
*  progress on this, including he did some numerical simulations, which was a little bit overkill as [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1652.8s)]
*  far as I could tell. But basically, we figured out what was the statement we wanted to make. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1659.28s)]
*  So this is again, sort of a lesson for you young scientists out there. We didn't even know what we [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1664.8s)]
*  wanted to say. Well, we started the paper, right? We just said, this is cool. This is interesting. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1669.6s)]
*  Let's think about it. Let's see if we can come up with something that would be interesting to say. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1674.7199999999998s)]
*  And eventually here is what we came up with to say, if you start in a space time, that is a two plus [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1680.56s)]
*  one dimensional space time with some point particles that does not already have a got time [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1687.4399999999998s)]
*  machine in it. So the point particles are moving slowly with respect to each other, not fast enough. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1693.12s)]
*  Guth showed that given the masses of the particles, they would have to be moving faster than a certain [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1698.48s)]
*  velocity in order to make this time machine. And so we proved, well, that's not true. Prove is too [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1702.96s)]
*  strong. We came up with an argument, let's put it that way, that said that if the particles aren't [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1708.24s)]
*  already moving fast enough, you can't get them to move fast enough to make a got time machine. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1713.44s)]
*  And we had to be a little bit clever about that. And we all did contribute about, you know, how do [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1718.88s)]
*  you propel a particle in two plus one dimensional gravity while conserving energy and things like [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1723.28s)]
*  that. And we figured that out. So we wrote a paper basically saying you can't build a got time machine [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  because you don't have enough energy. At least it seems that way. But it was very like we did an [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1733.76s)]
*  example and it didn't work. It wasn't an airtight proof. By the way, it was like slightly awkward [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1739.04s)]
*  situation because as I mentioned, Roman Jaqueve, who is also at MIT and Stanley Dessar and Gerard [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1745.6s)]
*  Atufft had been like the bosses of two plus one dimensional physics for a while and they had also [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1752.72s)]
*  pioneered two plus one dimensional gravity. And they read the got time machine paper and were [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1756.96s)]
*  outraged like no, this can't work. And they wrote a paper against it. But honestly, I think their [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  paper was just not that convincing. They just said we don't like it. It doesn't seem physical to us. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1765.6000000000001s)]
*  Whereas what Eddie and Alan and I tried to do was, you know, forget about whether you like it or not. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1770.72s)]
*  We're saying if you start with these boundary conditions, you can't get to it. And then we [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1775.68s)]
*  thought, you know, okay, but we want to do a little bit better. We're going to be a little bit more [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1780.16s)]
*  serious, a little bit more rigorous in proving that you can't do this. And again, we sort of [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1783.2s)]
*  bang our head against it. How do you make this work, et cetera. And the breakthrough came when I was [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1791.44s)]
*  traveling to give a talk at the University of Alberta. And Don Page, the famous cosmologist and [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1798.4s)]
*  quantum physicist was there and also one of his students or postdocs, Alex Lyons was there. And [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1804.72s)]
*  the three of us were talking together. And offhandedly, Don says, well, of course, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1809.04s)]
*  because I was talking about the group of Lorentz transformations in two plus one dimensions, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  which is SO2,1. And Don Page casually mentions, of course, that is anti-desider space. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1819.2s)]
*  And I said, what are you talking about? That is anti-desider space. And he explained to me [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1826.96s)]
*  that Lee groups, I didn't know this, but these continuous groups of transformations, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1831.6s)]
*  all the symmetry groups you've ever heard of, SO3, SU2, et cetera, they're all manifolds in [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1837.28s)]
*  their own rights and they have a natural metric on them. And the Lorentz group in three dimensions, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1842.08s)]
*  the group of Lorentz boosts and rotations and so forth, has a geometry that happens to be exactly [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1848.32s)]
*  that of three dimensional anti-desider space. This is long before the ADS-CFT correspondence [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1856.8s)]
*  or anything like that. And I didn't know anything about anti-desider space. I knew that it was a [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1862.64s)]
*  solution to Einstein's equations with a negative cosmological constant, but I didn't really know [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1867.1200000000001s)]
*  anything more deep about that. So he said that, and it was just sort of a toss off remark, but it [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1871.1200000000001s)]
*  stuck in my brain. And on the plane ride home, I was thinking about and I realized we could use [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1876.24s)]
*  that insight, that fact, to make a much simpler proof of the claim that we wanted to make. We [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1883.2s)]
*  could make basically a proof that you can't build a time machine without starting from one [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1889.44s)]
*  using nothing but drawing pictures of trajectories in anti-desider space. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1894.56s)]
*  And it was very lovely and I got to come back and talk to Alan and Eddie and explain to them [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1899.76s)]
*  that I had done this and they instantly got it. And yes, it was much, much cleaner than the... [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1904.8s)]
*  I love equations, but I really like diagrams better. And so when I was able to translate [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1912.64s)]
*  our equations into a diagram, I was much happier. Let's put it that way. Okay. But what happened was [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1918.32s)]
*  Alan and Eddie and I, we got a little full of ourselves. So we wrote a paper with some title, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1923.6s)]
*  something like, time machines cannot be created in an open two plus one dimensional universe with [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1929.6799999999998s)]
*  time by total momentum or something like that. And because we were feeling it a little bit, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  the title of our paper was that declarative statement. And then the abstract was simply [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1942.08s)]
*  four words. We proved the title and we were very pleased with ourselves in doing this. So anyone [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1948.32s)]
*  who has ever seen a TV show or movie knows what's coming next. We put the paper on the archive and [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1955.52s)]
*  people pointed out to us that we had not proven the title. There were loopholes in our argument. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1960.48s)]
*  And we, again, we sort of, you know, you bang your head against it. How do you close loopholes and [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1966.08s)]
*  whatever. And as often happens, we started talking to people and we talked to Ken Olam, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1969.92s)]
*  who was another grad student of Alan's at MIT at the time. Ken has now been a researcher in cosmology [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1974.16s)]
*  at Tufts for a very long time, super smart guy. And Ken came up with some very good suggestions for [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1981.04s)]
*  fixing our proof basically. And it took a while and it was interesting because, you know, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1987.92s)]
*  the reason I'm sort of going into the details is because who are the authors on a paper, right? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  This is always a good question. What kind of contribution counts? And Ken's contributions [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=1998.32s)]
*  went from, you know, meriting an acknowledgement in the paper to meriting a very strong acknowledgement [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2003.2s)]
*  in the paper to being a co-author on the paper. And that can happen depending on just how your [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2009.12s)]
*  conversations go. So in the revised version of the paper, Ken was a co-author. We changed the title [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2012.72s)]
*  to simply energy momentum restrictions on the creation of got time machines. And we had a real [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2019.28s)]
*  abstract explaining what was going on. So but I was very proud of that paper, both because I [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2023.52s)]
*  thought that the question was really interesting and I thought that I was happy with the cleverness [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2028.4s)]
*  of the way that we could do it. It was a miss. It was not a hit. Nobody cared. Got very few [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2033.2s)]
*  citations for either one of those papers. I guess the well, of course, there's a lot of interest in [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2038.56s)]
*  closed time like curves and closed time like curves and time machines. But where do you put [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2045.76s)]
*  your interest? So in the wormhole world, in the world that Kip Thorne and his friends were moving [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2050.64s)]
*  in, you couldn't solve the equations exactly. Okay, it's too hard. A wormhole solution in general [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2055.7599999999998s)]
*  relativity in three plus one dimensions is interesting, but very, very hard to exactly [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2063.04s)]
*  solve the equations. You have to sort of go on things you think are physically interesting. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2066.7999999999997s)]
*  In our world of point particles in three dimensions, you can solve all the equations exactly, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2071.44s)]
*  but it's not the real world. Right. So what are you interested in? Are you interested in the real [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2077.36s)]
*  world where you can only kind of solve the equations or the fake world where you can solve [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2082.8s)]
*  them exactly? There's good reasons to be interested in both. But in this case, people thought that the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2086.0800000000004s)]
*  real world was more interesting. Good for them. And also I did, I didn't actually expect that this [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2090.1600000000003s)]
*  would happen, but it did happen. People who we talked about this result to were, you know, looked [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2096.48s)]
*  down their noses at it just because we were writing about time machines. It was really that [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2103.84s)]
*  level of snootiness. You know, there's a famous acknowledgement in one of Kip Thorne's papers [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2108.96s)]
*  saying, you know, usually in the acknowledgement section, you said you talk, you acknowledge the [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  people you talk to, but then you also acknowledge your funding sources. So Kip, in one of his time [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2118.56s)]
*  machine papers wrote, this work was not supported by the National Science Foundation because I've [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2123.36s)]
*  been told that I cannot use my National Science Foundation grant to support work on time machines. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2128.4s)]
*  And I thought that was very funny, but it happened to me. I remember going to apply for postdocs and [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2134.08s)]
*  I interviewed at the Harvard Society of Fellows. And one of the people there was like, really, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2140.0s)]
*  you wrote about time machines. And literally he said, what would Richard Feynman say about that? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2146.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, Feynman, in fact, had thought about closed time like curves himself, so he probably [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2153.1200000000003s)]
*  would have been fine with it. But I was just surprised that people were really like that. I [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2156.6400000000003s)]
*  mean, if we had called it classifying the space of violations of global hyperbolicity in three [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2161.12s)]
*  dimensional solutions to Einstein's field equations, no one would have objected, even though it was [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2168.3199999999997s)]
*  exactly the same content to the paper. But if you call it an obstacle to building a time machine, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2172.64s)]
*  suddenly they cop an attitude, you know, what can you do? Anyway, so I love those papers, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2177.6s)]
*  but they were not really hits. Moving on, moving on is important here, because I took a postdoc at [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2182.08s)]
*  MIT where we finished up that second paper. The first paper was written while I was still a grad [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2188.64s)]
*  student at Harvard. And then I took a second postdoc at what was then the Institute for [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2192.7999999999997s)]
*  Theoretical Physics is now the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2198.24s)]
*  And I was making sort of career oriented mistakes right and left. I was very bad at guiding my [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2204.96s)]
*  career. I was basically working on quirky things that I thought were interesting and no one else [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2210.72s)]
*  cared about. And it was not going to get me a job. I was not a hot property on the job market. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2214.16s)]
*  And so by the end of my second postdoc, my second postdoc went from 1996 to 1999. Halfway through, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2219.04s)]
*  let's say, I realized like, if I'm going to continue in this physics thing, I have to write [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2226.8799999999997s)]
*  some papers that people care about, right, that actually have an impact on the field. Again, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2230.72s)]
*  I am not one of those people who thinks that it is bad to try to have an impact on the field. I [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  think that that's a good thing. That's why we do this. So just writing my own little papers that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2240.08s)]
*  I thought were cute, but no one else cared about was not really the only thing I should be doing. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2244.08s)]
*  You spend some of your time doing that, but it can't be the only thing. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2249.28s)]
*  So sadly, I was just not an expert in anything that the rest of the world was interested in [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2252.8s)]
*  at the time. You know, the mid 80s, people were super interested on the theoretical physics side [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2257.52s)]
*  of things in dualities and M theory and the second super string revolution and things like that, none [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2263.44s)]
*  of which were really my bag. Or on the cosmology side of things, we discovered the temperature [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2270.48s)]
*  and isotropies in the cosmic microwave background. And we were learning cosmological parameters from [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2276.8s)]
*  them or we're beginning to. So there's a huge amount of work in figuring out how best to extract [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2281.92s)]
*  the information that would be coming down from the new generation of cosmic background [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2286.48s)]
*  experiments and satellites and plug it into cosmological models. Also, it was like super [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2291.92s)]
*  important stuff to do and not what I would do for a living. So I was kind of stuck in between. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2297.28s)]
*  Happily, the accelerating universe came to my rescue. So in 1998, astronomers announced [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2301.76s)]
*  that they had evidence that the universe was not only expanding, but accelerating. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2308.88s)]
*  The easiest explanation for which would be the cosmological constant that had been supported, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2313.0400000000004s)]
*  that had been proposed by Einstein back in 1917. Now, I was for no especially good reason of my own, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2317.52s)]
*  the world's expert in the cosmological constant or one of the world's experts. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2326.56s)]
*  I had, along with Bill Press and Ed Turner, written a review article on the cosmological constant [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2330.88s)]
*  in 1992. Well, we didn't even think that it was real, but we thought, well, yeah, okay, we'll write [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2336.4s)]
*  down some equations, give you some options here. I had also written a paper with Greg Anderson, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2340.56s)]
*  which was a, you know, what we would now call an early model of dark energy before anyone had come [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2345.12s)]
*  up with the term dark energy. And I was also very close friends and frequent communicators with both [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  of the supernova teams that were actually measuring the acceleration of the universe. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2358.24s)]
*  Sol Promoters team from Berkeley and Brian Schmidt, Adam Reese, Bob Kirchner, that team, Nick Sunsiff, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2362.96s)]
*  lots of people that measured the cosmological constant from the high Z supernova team. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  And so I was friends with them. Adam has been on the podcast as a previous podcast guest. Brian [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2374.72s)]
*  Schmidt was my office mate in grad school. Sol and I had talked before they ever wrote their first [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2379.92s)]
*  paper about, you know, because he knew that I was a co-author on the review article. So anyway, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2385.6s)]
*  I had an in with the accelerating universe and Brian even sent me some of the plots before they [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2390.0s)]
*  became public and I didn't, you know, I was not allowed to release them to the public, but when [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2395.7599999999998s)]
*  the news became public, I could, you know, give talks and use the plots and things like that. So [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2400.24s)]
*  it was great, but it didn't help me any and as far as writing papers until I could say something [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2404.16s)]
*  interesting in the form of a physics paper. So literally I was saying like, what do I have to say [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2410.16s)]
*  about this? And there was a lot of effort by people like Paul Steinhardt and Rob Caldwell and others [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2414.16s)]
*  on dynamical candidates for the dark energy. That is to say what they were calling at the time, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2420.24s)]
*  quintessence fields, like a scalar field that would have very, very slowly changing energy [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2426.48s)]
*  density. So it would look kind of like a cosmological constant, like a true vacuum energy, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2433.28s)]
*  but it wouldn't really be a vacuum energy and maybe you have some interesting astrophysical [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2437.36s)]
*  effects. And this was popular and you know, I could have written about that, but it bugged me [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2442.56s)]
*  to be honest, like the whole discourse bugged me. And the reason why it bugged me is because by 1998, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2448.08s)]
*  unlike you know, eight years earlier, but by 1998, I knew some quantum field theory, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2453.36s)]
*  you know, I was still not a super expert, but I knew a little bit. And I knew that you couldn't [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2457.6s)]
*  just write down scalar fields with absurdly small masses. The mass of the scalar field that you need [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2461.84s)]
*  to be quintessence is something like 10 to the minus 33 electron volts. Just for comparison [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2468.2400000000002s)]
*  purposes, the electron is about half a million electron volts and the lightest massive particle, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2473.6s)]
*  we're sure the neutrinos are thought to be about 10 to the minus three electron volts. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2479.12s)]
*  And this quintessence field that you're positing is 10 to the minus 33 electron volts. Where in the [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2484.48s)]
*  world did that come from? Ordinarily in quantum field theory, if we have a mass parameter that is [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2489.2799999999997s)]
*  very, very small, there's a reason why. There's a symmetry or something like this that makes it that [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2496.72s)]
*  way. And these people, these cosmologists were just writing it down because it fit the data, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2502.08s)]
*  which is also a fine thing to do, but you would like to be a little bit more respectable than that. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2506.24s)]
*  And furthermore, once you have that light scalar field, it can couple to other fields and you can [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2510.16s)]
*  even estimate how big the coupling should be and say, should I have seen this scalar field already [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2515.9199999999996s)]
*  in the experiments? And the answer was certainly yes. And I knew this very informally, like in my [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2522.56s)]
*  head, it wasn't like a detailed calculation, it was just sort of background knowledge. But what hit [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2527.2799999999997s)]
*  me was I knew a loophole to this whole argument because remember that first paper I wrote with [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2532.64s)]
*  Roman and George about violating the Renson variants? There was something about that that [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2539.52s)]
*  did always bug me when we were first writing the paper. We start with the idea that you have a [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2543.52s)]
*  constant vector field filling all of space-time, right? Well, that sounds very innocent and [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2548.24s)]
*  innocuous, but there's no such thing as a constant vector field in a curved space-time. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2553.68s)]
*  The mathematical criterion that a vector field be constant doesn't make any sense once you're in a [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2559.2s)]
*  curved manifold. So what do you even mean? Like you can make it make sense in cosmology, which we did, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2564.48s)]
*  that's all we looked at in that first paper, but in more general situations, just no way to do it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2570.16s)]
*  So there's different strategies you can have. Basically, there's two strategies. One is the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2574.8799999999997s)]
*  vector field is not actually constant, but it's constant length, and it wants to more or less line [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2579.52s)]
*  up so that it becomes essentially constant or pretty close. This is called an ether field. Ted [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2585.76s)]
*  Jacobson and others have worked on this, and I later wrote papers about it. But in the particular [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2591.28s)]
*  case of the vector field that George and Roman and I use, there's a simpler way to do it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2596.4s)]
*  If instead of a vector field, you have a scalar field, that is to say a field that is just a number [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2603.28s)]
*  at every point in space-time rather than a vector with a magnitude and a direction, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2609.92s)]
*  but that scalar field is changing. So the scalar field has a derivative, it has a gradient, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2614.0s)]
*  it has a direction and a magnitude in which it is changing. That gradient of the scalar field is a [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2619.1200000000003s)]
*  vector field. So rather than the vector field itself being the thing that violates the Renson [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2624.96s)]
*  variance, you could just have a scalar field that is changing gradually throughout the universe, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2629.36s)]
*  and that would pick out a preferred reference frame, the rest frame of the scalar field, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  and there would be a vector that would be the gradient of that scalar field. And it turns out [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2638.8s)]
*  that you can couple it naturally to electromagnetism. And this is all compatible with symmetries [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2643.92s)]
*  that mean that you can't couple this scalar field to other fields in any way at all, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2650.6400000000003s)]
*  at least, well, there's some loopholes there, but that's the basic idea. So basically what I'm saying [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2655.28s)]
*  is if you wanted to have a scalar field that could be the dark energy and that scalar field [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2659.04s)]
*  has a natural symmetry that both keeps its mass low and prevents it from coupling to other fields, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2667.04s)]
*  then there's a natural way to do it. And I knew what that natural way was. So I wrote a paper in [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2675.6s)]
*  1998 called Quintessence and the Rest of the World. And the idea was to say, here's how you can have [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2679.68s)]
*  your quintessence without it violating all the usual rules about experimental bounds with other [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2685.92s)]
*  fields. And the cherry on the top of the sundae was, of course, there was one experimental effect. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2691.44s)]
*  It was cosmological birefringence. It was exactly that photons traveling through this [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2698.7200000000003s)]
*  quintessence field, this pseudo scalar field, it's a pseudo scalar because it's odd under [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2702.88s)]
*  parity transformations, they would rotate their planes of polarization. And you could search for [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2708.0s)]
*  that in the data. And, you know, George and Roma and I had put a limit on that, but the limit wasn't [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2713.12s)]
*  as good as possible. Maybe there was still some room under there. And in fact, in the Quintessence [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2718.24s)]
*  and the Rest of the World paper, I estimated what you might guess for the parameters you knew about [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2722.7999999999997s)]
*  dark energy, what you might guess the rotation is. And the answer was about one degree, which was [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2727.68s)]
*  smaller than the limits. We had a limit of about five degrees, or I think, yeah, five degrees, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2733.12s)]
*  two degrees, I forget what it was. It depends on what data source you used. But the point was, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2738.24s)]
*  it was on the one hand below the limit, so we were not incompatible. And on the other hand, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2742.3999999999996s)]
*  reachable if you improved the data. And so these days, people like my colleague Mark Kaminkowski [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2747.28s)]
*  and others showed that you could do even better if you use the cosmic microwave background, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2752.88s)]
*  and people are trying to do that. And so that's an ongoing interesting thing going on. So that [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2756.96s)]
*  paper was a hit. That was the time 1998, where the whole accelerating universe thing was new and [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2762.32s)]
*  exciting and sexy. And all the ideas, you know, the low hanging fruit had not been picked, you could [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2769.36s)]
*  write down a model, you could point some things out, you could point out mistakes other people [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2774.32s)]
*  were making, and would all have a big impact. So that paper went very well and has gotten a [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2778.56s)]
*  lot of citations since then. So now we can move on to the next phase when I was at the University [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2782.6400000000003s)]
*  of Chicago. And I'll tell you, I was looking back for this podcast at my CV looking for the [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2787.84s)]
*  list of favorite papers. And I can't find any real misses when I was at the University of Chicago. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2794.56s)]
*  There were some misses in terms of not getting citations, but the papers I loved when I was there [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2800.72s)]
*  also were very big hits, got a lot of citations overall, like very roughly, I'm counting over [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2806.9599999999996s)]
*  100 citations as good. It's not super good until you get over 1000, roughly speaking, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2812.56s)]
*  by physics standards, everyone's standards are different. I should mention, by the way, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  especially for those of you out there who have your own podcast or are doing your own research [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2821.8399999999997s)]
*  on important questions of scientific moment, you can find out who has written papers, they get a [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2827.2s)]
*  lot of citations and what those papers are and who has cited them, just go to Google Scholar [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2834.0s)]
*  and type them in. So if you're trying to book someone for your podcast, and they claim to be [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2838.3199999999997s)]
*  a biologist and have an important new theory about the origin of COVID or something like that, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2843.8399999999997s)]
*  plug them in. And it doesn't, the fact that someone has a lot of citations doesn't mean [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2849.9199999999996s)]
*  they're sensible. There's Nobel Prize winners who are no longer sensible people. But it is a good [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2853.84s)]
*  first pass at saying like, is this a real scientist who's written papers and has made an impact on [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2858.56s)]
*  the community or not? It is not airtight, don't get me wrong. There's highly cited papers that [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2863.44s)]
*  are nonsense. There are papers that have no citations that are great, but it is correlated. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2869.92s)]
*  Having a positive impact on the rest of the field is correlated with being a good paper, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2876.1600000000003s)]
*  and it's easy to check by anyone by going online. So anyway, yes, I wrote a bunch of papers, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2880.16s)]
*  they did well when I was at the University of Chicago. In terms of the Joni Mitchell analogy, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2886.56s)]
*  this would be the blue for the roses, court and spark period of my output, as it were. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2891.2799999999997s)]
*  I know what you're thinking. At the end of that period, I was denied tenure and had to leave. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2897.7599999999998s)]
*  Why did that happen if all of my papers were getting all these citations? Yeah, good question. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2902.16s)]
*  I don't know. Sometimes the academic wheel is a little confusing in how it moves. But anyway, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2907.2s)]
*  let me pick a couple papers. Again, what I care most about here is being informative about the [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2912.16s)]
*  process. How do you come up with ideas? How do you come up with papers, choose collaborators, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  things like that. So it's still the aftermath. My years at the University of Chicago were still [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  the aftermath of having discovered the dark energy and the acceleration of the universe. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2929.7599999999998s)]
*  And I was thinking about that a lot. It was obviously an important question to think about. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2933.68s)]
*  It's only kind of an interesting question if it's not the cosmological constant. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2939.2s)]
*  The cosmological constant is the best, most likely candidate for what the dark energy is. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2943.9199999999996s)]
*  It's the simplest, it's the most robust, it is not subject to these experimental tests I was [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2948.8799999999997s)]
*  just telling you about. It's a puzzle why it is small. But even if you have a non cosmological [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2953.68s)]
*  constant candidate for what the dark energy is, it is still a puzzle why the cosmological constant [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2960.88s)]
*  is small. That's just a puzzle one way or the other. You're not getting rid of that. In the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2966.32s)]
*  very, very early days of dynamical dark energy models, there was a hope we could pick the dynamics [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2970.0800000000004s)]
*  of the scalar field. So it would somehow explain why the cosmological constant is small, but that [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2975.6800000000003s)]
*  basically never works. So we're basically looking around for alternatives just because there may be [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2981.04s)]
*  either number one, they're sort of interesting to physicists, whether or not they're more robust [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2987.52s)]
*  and simpler than the cosmological constant, but also number two, maybe something good will happen. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2993.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe by playing around with different ways of making the universe accelerate, you'll realize, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=2998.3199999999997s)]
*  oh, you know, in step five of thinking about it, you'll go, this actually does help solve the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3003.52s)]
*  cosmological constant problem or something like that. So especially in those days, the early 2000s, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3007.92s)]
*  it was absolutely perfectly sensible to think hard about all the different ways you could make [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3013.9199999999996s)]
*  the universe accelerate. And there was, it was also, you know, we also knew that dark matter [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3018.16s)]
*  existed, right? There was evidence for dark matter. And there was this ongoing debate about whether [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3023.8399999999997s)]
*  or not dark matter could be replaced by modifying gravity. Okay. In fact, you know, there was this [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3029.68s)]
*  nice numerical coincidence that if you look at a galaxy like the Milky Way or the large spiral [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3036.48s)]
*  galaxies, Mond, Modified Newtonian Dynamics from Mordecai Milgram, pointed out that there is a [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3043.36s)]
*  radius around the middle of the galaxy, around the center of the galaxy, interior to which you [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3051.12s)]
*  don't need dark matter and outside of which you do. And that radius is different for different [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3057.52s)]
*  galaxies. It's not a fixed distance, but the acceleration due to gravity in the good old [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3063.12s)]
*  Newtonian sense is approximately equal in all the different galaxies that Milgram originally looked [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3069.44s)]
*  at. And numerically, the acceleration due to gravity where the data from rotation curves [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3075.12s)]
*  in spiral galaxies stops fitting and you need to invoke dark matter is numerically approximately [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3082.48s)]
*  equal to the Hubble constant today, which is numerically approximately equal to the cosmological [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3088.48s)]
*  constant today in appropriate units where you have to like take the right powers and divide by [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3094.16s)]
*  Newton's constant and things like that. So these things are all numerically similar to each other. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3098.56s)]
*  It is very, very natural to ask if that numerical similarity is related to some underlying physical [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3104.64s)]
*  common origin. Is there some reason why this feature of the dark matter, namely where it is [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3111.28s)]
*  in spiral galaxies, it makes perfect sense that there's more dark matter at the edges of galaxies [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3117.68s)]
*  than at the center because ordinary matter naturally falls into the center in ways that [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3122.3999999999996s)]
*  dark matter doesn't. But the specific place where that crossover happens is less obvious. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3126.3199999999997s)]
*  And why it's connected to the Hubble constant, maybe it's just because there's not that many [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3132.24s)]
*  numbers it can be, but maybe there's a deeper physical understanding. So I thought about that [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3136.16s)]
*  and I was trying to think, I was very sympathetic to the idea that we would come up with a [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3141.44s)]
*  way of replacing dark matter by modifying gravity. I thought that was a very interesting idea. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3145.28s)]
*  Today, 20 years later, I'm much more down on that idea because it's basically been ruled out by the [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3151.44s)]
*  data. I know that people are hanging on to it, but once ideas are ruled out by the data, I lose [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3157.44s)]
*  interest in them. At the time though, in 2004, I was very interested. And so I specifically was [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  focusing on this similarity, the similarity of the acceleration scale where dark matter kicks in in [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3167.2000000000003s)]
*  spiral galaxies and the acceleration scale where the universe starts accelerating because they're [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3172.96s)]
*  numerically similar to each other. So I said, what is common between these two features, these two [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3178.1600000000003s)]
*  parts of the universe, these two regimes of space-time? And the answer is that gravity is weak, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3185.12s)]
*  right? If you think about the gravitational field of a galaxy, there's more stuff near the center [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  of the galaxy than near the edges, so the gravitational field becomes weaker and weaker. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3197.52s)]
*  And it is where the gravitational field becomes sufficiently weak that you need to invoke dark [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3202.7200000000003s)]
*  matter or modified gravity. Likewise, for the expansion of the universe, at early times, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3208.0s)]
*  when the universe is dense and expanding rapidly, the curvature of space-time is relatively large. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3213.84s)]
*  And it's late in the history of the universe when space-time is becoming more and more flat overall [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3219.6s)]
*  that you have this new thing kick in and you need to have the universe accelerate. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3225.44s)]
*  So I said to myself, okay, can we make money out of that? Can we make money out of the fact that [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3230.08s)]
*  in both the dark matter case and the dark energy case, the new effect seems to be kicking in when [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3234.56s)]
*  gravity is weak. That's a weird thing, right? That's not what you would expect, but that's okay. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3240.08s)]
*  You're trying to fit the data. Sometimes you try to fit data. You have to go to weird places. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3244.48s)]
*  So is there any way to modify our favorite theory of gravity, Einstein's general relativity, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3249.12s)]
*  in such a way that it is still general relativity in ordinary circumstances, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3255.2s)]
*  but when space-time becomes nearly flat, you deviate from that. And again, I know a little [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3259.8399999999997s)]
*  bit of quantum field theory, so I was able to think about this in terms of how would a quantum [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3266.24s)]
*  field theorist react. This is all classical in fact, so how would a classical field theorist [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3270.72s)]
*  think about this? Einstein and his friend David Hilbert figured out that you could derive [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3274.56s)]
*  Einstein's equations from an action principle. The principle of least action says that there's this [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3280.08s)]
*  quantity you can calculate that is minimized when you solve the equations of motion, and the question [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3286.48s)]
*  is what is the action? The action turns out to be an integral of the Lagrangian. I mentioned [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3291.28s)]
*  Lagrangian before that I learned about when we were writing our paper on Lorentz violation in [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3295.92s)]
*  cosmology. So could you write down an action which is ordinary when space-time is curved and [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3301.2s)]
*  weird and different when space-time is nearly flat? Well, the simplest thing to do is just to [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3308.32s)]
*  add a constant to the action, but we already did that with the cosmological constant. The next [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3312.48s)]
*  simplest thing to do is to write something that is inversely dependent on the curvature, right? You [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3317.2000000000003s)]
*  have an easy number called the curvature scalar, capital R. For those of you who have read space, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3322.6400000000003s)]
*  time, and motion, the biggest idea is number one, capital R, the curvature scalar that appears in [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3329.28s)]
*  Einstein's equation. R all by itself is basically the Lagrangian that gives you general relativity. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3333.92s)]
*  So what about something that is a number that gets bigger and bigger when R gets smaller and smaller, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3340.8s)]
*  like one over R is the simplest thing you could possibly do, okay? So what if you modified gravity [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3347.44s)]
*  by just writing down R plus one over R instead of just R all by itself as the action for gravity? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3354.4s)]
*  And I was, so you know, then it's a homework problem then, right? You have your idea and now [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3361.52s)]
*  you have to solve the equations. I knew how to go from that kind of proposal to equations of motion [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3366.88s)]
*  and try to solve them and things like that. Eventually I learned, I think it was Ted Jacobson [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3373.12s)]
*  who mentioned this to me, but I would have stumbled across it myself just in, you know, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3377.92s)]
*  searching other people's papers. Whenever you have a theory of gravity that is some modification of [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3382.8s)]
*  general relativity just by doing weird things with the curvature scalar, you can, you basically [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3389.76s)]
*  bring a new degree of freedom to life. Einstein's original theory by itself has only the metric, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3396.0s)]
*  has his only dynamical degree of freedom, but if you do, if you try to mess around with it, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3402.96s)]
*  generically you will bring to life other degrees of freedom. That makes perfect sense once you [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3407.28s)]
*  know little quantum field theory. In particular, this kind of theory, R plus one over R, is actually [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3411.1200000000003s)]
*  equivalent to what is called a scalar tensor theory. You have a tensor field, the metric, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3416.56s)]
*  and you also have a scalar field that you just brought to life with this kind of new action. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3421.6s)]
*  You can then show that in such theories the Schwarzschild solution, the solution that you [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3426.7999999999997s)]
*  get in ordinary general relativity around the sun or something like that, is also a solution [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3433.52s)]
*  to your scalar tensor theory. So what this means is that there's, you're not going to expect anything [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  new and weird when you're far away from a gravitating object like the galaxy. So I realized [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3445.36s)]
*  that this approach, maybe it would help the universe accelerate, I mean I showed that yes, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3452.2400000000002s)]
*  there's solutions where the universe is accelerating, but it did not help with dark [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3457.1200000000003s)]
*  matter. So my dream, my aspirations of unifying dark matter and dark energy into one modification [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3460.96s)]
*  of gravity failed. And therefore my response was to put it in a drawer and forget about it. Like I [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3468.2400000000002s)]
*  said, okay well it didn't work, too bad. And I didn't think anything more of it. And what happened [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3474.48s)]
*  was I got an, I forget the order of operations here, but two things happened. One is I got an [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3480.08s)]
*  email from Mark Troughton, who is a good friend of mine and frequent collaborator, and this was months [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3485.92s)]
*  later, and he said, has anyone ever written or looked into a theory of gravity that has a one over [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3491.28s)]
*  R term in the gravitational Lagrangian, just like the ordinary R term? And I said, well I did, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3498.16s)]
*  I found this and this and this, but I didn't really get very excited about it. And almost at [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3504.7200000000003s)]
*  the same time, Vikram Devuri, who was a grad student at the University of Chicago at the time, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3509.6800000000003s)]
*  working with Mike Turner, came into my office and said, has anyone ever thought of adding a one over [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3513.6800000000003s)]
*  R term, the Lagrangian for gravity, to change the equations of motion? And I'm like, well, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3519.04s)]
*  I guess I did, and I thought it was not interesting, but clearly it is interesting [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3524.8s)]
*  because people keep knocking on my door or sending me emails saying let's do this. So we ended up [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3528.2400000000002s)]
*  doing that, and it ended up being me, Vikram, Mike Turner, and Mark Troughton on a paper called Is [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3532.24s)]
*  Cosmic Speed Up Due to New Gravitational Physics? And again, this is a lesson that I never really [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3538.9599999999996s)]
*  learned, but I should learn. I thought it was a fun little model. At first I put it in the drawer, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3546.8799999999997s)]
*  but then eventually the team ended up pushing it out the door and into the physical review, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3552.8799999999997s)]
*  and it blew up. It's by far my highest cited original research paper by now, in part because [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3559.12s)]
*  it's full employment. It gives theoretical physicists a new toy to play with. We write [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3566.0s)]
*  down a way to modify gravity, and we don't talk about dark matter at all. We're not trying to [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3571.92s)]
*  explain dark matter, but does it explain the acceleration of the universe? Well, you know, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3576.4s)]
*  maybe, but guess what? Someone writes a paper saying, oh, actually it's incompatible with the [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3580.88s)]
*  following experimental bound, and someone else writes a paper saying, oh, but there's this twist [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3584.8s)]
*  that we can put on it that helps it escape that experimental bound, and you go on and on, and you [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3589.1200000000003s)]
*  try to constrain it against large-scale structure and come up with two variations on the theme. You [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3594.32s)]
*  open a new kind of set of research questions by suggesting that. So I've done that twice in my [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3598.5600000000004s)]
*  life, successfully so far, with the Lorentz violating stuff and with the modified gravity [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3604.96s)]
*  stuff. So give people a new playground to play in. That is the lesson for getting songs on your hit [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3609.92s)]
*  record there. Okay, so then I'm going to, like I said, most of my papers did pretty well during [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3617.6s)]
*  that period, but I'm going to classify this one as kind of a miss, even though it really wasn't, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3624.48s)]
*  and this is the well-known paper, Spontaneous Inflation and the Origin of the Arrow of Time, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3629.36s)]
*  that I wrote with Jennifer Chen. So Jenny Chen was a grad student at Chicago at the time. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3633.76s)]
*  This did get this, crossed my hundred citation threshold, but it didn't get as many citations [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3639.12s)]
*  as I think it should have, so I'm going to put it in the in the Mrs. album here. The idea here was, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3644.24s)]
*  you probably know the story, many of you know the story, but not all of you, so I'll tell it anyway. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3652.64s)]
*  There is this question about the arrow of time. Why does time have an arrow? Well, we kind of know [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3658.48s)]
*  the answer, and the answer is because entropy is increasing. Why is entropy increasing? Well, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3665.12s)]
*  there's two parts to that answer. One is from Ludwig Boltzmann, who said, what you mean by entropy [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3670.72s)]
*  is the number of one of the possible things you could mean by it. There's a footnote here, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3677.52s)]
*  there's many different definitions of entropy. The one we are, is relevant here is, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3681.92s)]
*  the entropy is the logarithm of the number of ways you can arrange the system so that it looks [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3688.08s)]
*  macroscopically the same. The logarithm of the number of microstates within a macrostate, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3692.72s)]
*  that's half the answer. The other half the answer, why is entropy increasing, is because [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3697.3599999999997s)]
*  it started in a low entropy microstate. The past hypothesis, there's an initial condition [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3701.7599999999998s)]
*  that is crucially important to explaining the second law of thermodynamics. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3707.9199999999996s)]
*  That's obviously a job for cosmologists, right? And this has been pointed out that this is a job [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3712.9599999999996s)]
*  for cosmologists by many, many people. Richard Feynman writes about it in the character of physical [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3717.3599999999997s)]
*  law and the Feynman lectures on physics and so forth. He thought that Caltech first year [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3722.48s)]
*  undergraduate should understand this, even though most modern cosmologists still don't. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3727.92s)]
*  We need to understand why the early universe had low entropy. And I learned about that fact from [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3731.6s)]
*  Roger Penrose. Penrose in the 1970s really emphasized the fact that the early universe [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3737.44s)]
*  had low entropy and that was a mystery, that was very, very strange. In the 1980s, inflationary [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3744.32s)]
*  cosmology comes along and pretends to explain this problem and doesn't really succeed. It might be [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3749.76s)]
*  part of the solution, but by itself, it simply asserts an initial condition just like anything [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3755.92s)]
*  else. So as far as I was concerned, in the 2000s, this was still unanswered. And for me, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3761.44s)]
*  the tipping point was, well, there are two tipping points. One was, I read a paper by Hugh Price, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3767.76s)]
*  the philosopher of science, who coined what he called the double standard principle. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3772.6400000000003s)]
*  There were a lot of cosmological models at the time. So before we discovered dark energy, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3777.7599999999998s)]
*  especially, Price was writing about models where we didn't even know whether the universe was open, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  closed, or flat. So it could be, in principle, that if you have a universe with enough energy in it, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3787.6s)]
*  it will expand for a while, stop expanding, and then re-collapse, right, as a closed universe. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3794.08s)]
*  There's no reason, if you have a model that has a big bang, expands, cools, and then starts [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3800.48s)]
*  re-collapsing and crunches again, just because you put initial conditions on where entropy is low, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3806.88s)]
*  there's no reason you should put last conditions on so that entropy is low, final conditions. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3814.4s)]
*  The entropy should just grow if you don't do something, if you don't impose something [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3819.7599999999998s)]
*  to make it do something different. So you could easily have models where the universe expands and [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3825.04s)]
*  then re-collapses, the big bang is low entropy, but the big crunch is high entropy. What Price [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3830.4s)]
*  pointed out was that in cosmologists' attempts to account for the low entropy of the early universe, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3836.48s)]
*  they cheated. They cheat over and over again. They invent principles. They don't even necessarily [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3843.04s)]
*  talk about entropy, but they talk about the simplicity or whatever, the naturalness of the [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3848.08s)]
*  initial conditions, but they don't apply those same criteria of simplicity or naturalness to the [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3851.92s)]
*  final conditions. And that's fine if you think that there is some intrinsic direction of time, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3857.44s)]
*  some intrinsic difference between the past and the future, but the laws of physics don't have that, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3863.2000000000003s)]
*  and most of the cosmologists who are writing these models down didn't believe that there was any such [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3867.92s)]
*  intrinsic directionality to time, so they were just cheating. So Price's double standard principle is, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  if you think something is natural for the early universe, you should think it's natural for the [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3878.08s)]
*  late universe, for the beginning and for the end. Now he was writing this paper before we knew about [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3882.72s)]
*  the acceleration of the universe, so his conclusion was the universe probably does have a big bang and [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3888.48s)]
*  a big crunch, and they are both low entropy. We don't know why. Either one is low entropy, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3893.6s)]
*  but at least it's playing fair. At least it's using the same criteria for both the future and [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3898.7999999999997s)]
*  the past. So to a physicist, this was not the right direction. Like the laying out of the problem was [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3906.32s)]
*  perfectly sensible, etc., but basically for the sake of being playing fair, you're imposing equally [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3912.96s)]
*  weird ill justified conditions on both the past and the future. That does not make things better. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3920.56s)]
*  That makes things worse. So I was very, very interested in could you solve this problem [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3926.6400000000003s)]
*  without sort of making things worse, without putting any fine tuning in there. And at the time, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3932.24s)]
*  so 2004 is when we wrote the paper, I was certainly thinking a lot about the accelerating universe. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3937.8399999999997s)]
*  So the accelerating universe will eventually become desider space. So let's put it this way. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3944.64s)]
*  And this is this sort of, I can't even tell you exactly when which idea appeared. This is something [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3949.04s)]
*  that Jenny and I were talking about back and forth for a while, and I was also spending time at a [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3953.52s)]
*  program back at KITP on superstring cosmology at the time. So I was talking to people there too, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3958.4s)]
*  David Gross and Tom Banks and a bunch of people, Joe Polchinski. And desider space is, like anti-desider [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3964.6400000000003s)]
*  space is the solution to Einstein's equations with a negative cosmological constant, desider space is [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3972.88s)]
*  the solution to Einstein's equation with a positive cosmological constant, a positive vacuum energy. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3977.44s)]
*  And that has a, if you draw a picture of it, very, very roughly, it looks like a hyperboloid, right? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3983.2799999999997s)]
*  So there is a throat, there's a middle, and that's kind of a fake because we can't really embed things [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3990.56s)]
*  in a very clear way in the universe that we see. But anyway, it kind of looks like a middle out of [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=3996.96s)]
*  which it grows bigger and bigger toward the future and to the past, it also grows bigger and bigger. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4002.0s)]
*  So there's like a narrowing in the middle, and then it expands again. And so both in the far past [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4007.36s)]
*  and par of future, it's getting bigger and bigger. That's desider space all by itself. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4012.08s)]
*  The Big Bang model, as we conventionally understand it, starts with obviously something [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4016.56s)]
*  totally different than that. It starts with a singular moment, and then after that it's hot and [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4020.72s)]
*  dense and rapidly expanding. And with the positive cosmological constant, it would eventually open up [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4025.6s)]
*  and cool off and turn into this sort of endlessly expanding and accelerating desider phase in the [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4031.36s)]
*  future. And the entropy version of that story is that the universe starts out with low entropy, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4038.72s)]
*  and as it expands and cools and empties out, its entropy increases. And in fact, that was the time [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4045.2s)]
*  when I started thinking that this process of the universe emptying out and becoming closer and [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4051.12s)]
*  closer to desider space reminded me of the second law of thermodynamics, reminded me of the approach [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4059.04s)]
*  to equilibration of a thermal system. And so I thought there must be, and then I did stumble [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4066.72s)]
*  across an idea called the cosmic no-hair theorem. The cosmic no-hair theorem was, I think, first put [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4074.9599999999996s)]
*  forward by Bob Wald in the 1980s. If you have a universe with nothing but a cosmological constant, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4080.7999999999997s)]
*  eventually it will empty out into desider space. All the perturbations will go away. The universe [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4086.7999999999997s)]
*  becomes emptier and emptier forever. That sounded like an approach to equilibrium. So eventually, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4091.9199999999996s)]
*  many years later with Aidan Chatwin Davis in 2017, I wrote a paper called Cosmic Equilibration, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4096.4s)]
*  a holographic no-hair theorem for the generalized second law where we established a connection [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4103.36s)]
*  between the cosmic no-hair theorem and the second law of thermodynamics. But back in 2004, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4108.48s)]
*  I didn't know about that. All I knew was that the early universe had low entropy and the future [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4113.92s)]
*  would have high entropy and the future looks like desider space. So I was enough, and this is where [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4118.32s)]
*  talking to philosophers helped a little bit, reading some philosophy papers. I hadn't been [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4123.92s)]
*  doing that much of that back in 2004. I literally got engaged in discussions with professional [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4127.44s)]
*  people who work on the foundations of physics only because I wrote this paper with Jenny about [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4134.5599999999995s)]
*  the arrow of time. That's when I hooked up with that whole group of people and found my happy home. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4139.839999999999s)]
*  But I'd been reading a few of their papers and I was philosophically adept enough to be able to [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4146.4s)]
*  tell what is cheating from what is not cheating. So we are very, very biased by the fact that we [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4152.48s)]
*  live in a universe that is in the aftermath of the hot big bang with low entropy. We think it's [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4158.0s)]
*  natural because it's what we see around us. But if you step back and ask what really is the natural [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4162.08s)]
*  universe, arguably the answer would be desider space, an empty universe with nothing in it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4167.679999999999s)]
*  Why? Well, because that's the high entropy configuration. And from Boltzmann's original [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4174.48s)]
*  definition, high entropy means there are many, many states that look like that. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4179.28s)]
*  That's the one you would get if you randomly asked. So everyone else in cosmology was asking, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4183.36s)]
*  why did the big bang have this property or that property? Jenny and I started asking, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4189.84s)]
*  why don't we live into desider space? Why don't we live in an empty universe? Why is there a big bang [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4194.639999999999s)]
*  at all? And what we realized is that there's various ways, it took us a few tries, but we realized, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4199.44s)]
*  okay, there's various ways to be in desider space but not stay there. And one way, the way that we [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4206.16s)]
*  sort of focused in on was actually first studied by Eddie Farre and Alan Guth and their collaborators [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4212.72s)]
*  back in the 1980s, the creation of baby universes. If you get exactly the right amount of matter and [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4218.88s)]
*  energy in a very tiny region of space, then as far as we know, we don't know for sure because [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4225.84s)]
*  quantum gravity is hard and it's tricky and the calculations are not completely well defined, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4230.16s)]
*  but it seems plausible that you can make a little self-contained baby universe that buds off and [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4234.64s)]
*  goes its own way out of basically nothing at all. You need some initial energy, but you can get that [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4241.12s)]
*  from a quantum fluctuation if you like. You don't need to actually assemble it in your laboratory. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4246.8s)]
*  So you could think that you were into desider space, but you could be constantly at a very, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4251.4400000000005s)]
*  very low rate, but nevertheless inevitably because the universe lasts forever, be budding [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4256.88s)]
*  off new baby universes which would start very small, which would naturally look like they were [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4261.52s)]
*  ready to inflate and then they would look kind of like the Big Bang. They would expand and cool and [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4266.56s)]
*  become universes of their own and approach a desider phase. So the universe that we are in [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4270.56s)]
*  could be a baby universe from a pre-existing universe that was just empty and desider space. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4276.4800000000005s)]
*  And indeed it evades Hugh Price's argument about the double standard principle because you can play [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4282.88s)]
*  the same game backward in time. You can evolve backward and you can bud off baby universes and [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4288.32s)]
*  they could increase in entropy and they would have a narrow time pointing in the other direction. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4292.88s)]
*  So the specific cosmological details here about baby universes and desider space and whatever [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4299.28s)]
*  are not the most important point here. I think that they're a good hand wavy suggestion as to [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4305.84s)]
*  maybe what can happen, but the underlying rules are sufficiently loosey goosey that it's hard to [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4312.0s)]
*  really make them careful and rigorous to the point where for example you could use that idea to [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4317.84s)]
*  make a prediction for the inflationary density perturbations that you could test in the cosmic [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4325.04s)]
*  microwave background. That's an absolutely plausible thing to think about doing but we don't know how [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4330.08s)]
*  to do it quite yet. But the general idea that the universe could be infinite and restless, that [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4334.48s)]
*  there's always a way for the universe to expand and make more and more universe with more and more [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4340.96s)]
*  entropy and along the way, the way that it makes more entropy is by making universes like ours [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4346.48s)]
*  and it does that in both directions of time past and future. I still think that 20 years later that [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4352.719999999999s)]
*  is the only attempt at explaining why the our early universe has low entropy that doesn't cheat. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4358.959999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to phrase that as carefully as I can. I don't think it's necessarily right, it's highly [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4366.959999999999s)]
*  speculative, there might be something completely different out there, but it doesn't cheat, it [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4373.44s)]
*  doesn't fine-tune anywhere, it plays by the rules in other words. So people can disagree with that, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4377.36s)]
*  like there have been some citations, people have disagreed, that's great, that's how science marches [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4384.879999999999s)]
*  forward, but I still think it's the most promising general framework to go forward. So that's one that [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4389.36s)]
*  is very dear to my heart even though it didn't get nearly the citations that many of my other papers [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4396.5599999999995s)]
*  about dark energy and so forth back from those eras got. Okay, then I moved to Caltech and [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4402.08s)]
*  there's only so many things you can say about dark energy, so I started thinking about dark [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4409.12s)]
*  matter a little bit among other things while I was at Caltech. And again, the story is interesting. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4413.44s)]
*  By the way, there's something I should have mentioned back when I was talking about the [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4420.32s)]
*  quintessence and the rest of the world paper. Like I said, the idea that light scalar fields [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4423.36s)]
*  can be coupled to all sorts of other fields and therefore be experimentally testable, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4428.32s)]
*  that was in the air, people knew about that. And I just knew that there's a way out, there's a loophole [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4431.759999999999s)]
*  if you had a specific kind of pseudo-scalar field etc. But basically the whole idea and much of the [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4437.28s)]
*  outline of the paper occurred to me as I was traveling from Santa Barbara to Chicago to give [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4444.08s)]
*  a talk at a conference. There was a talk at Fermilab that was invited to give on dark energy in the [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4451.04s)]
*  accelerating universe and I wasn't sure what to talk about. And so I sort of put these ideas [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4456.24s)]
*  together in my head on the plane ride over and wrote up the talk and it was a short paper that [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4461.76s)]
*  I wrote after that. So there's even though I think that there is a correlation between how many [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4466.24s)]
*  citations you get and how good the paper is, far from a perfect correlation, but there is a positive [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4471.679999999999s)]
*  correlation. As far as I know, there's no correlation between how much work you do on a paper and how [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4477.28s)]
*  good it is or how important it is. You can work really really hard on a paper and it's all solid [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4482.4s)]
*  and good but at the end like it's eh okay well you proved something but I'm not that interested in it. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4488.48s)]
*  Or you can just have one little flash that you can write down over a weekend and that's a highly [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4493.44s)]
*  cited paper so either way happens. Anyway I was reminded of that because the next paper I want to [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4497.759999999999s)]
*  talk about is called Dark Matter and Dark Radiation from 2008 and it started when I was once again, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4502.16s)]
*  I was not sort of flying to a workshop needing to give a talk but I was visiting some place, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4510.24s)]
*  I even forget where I was visiting honestly. And as happens when you visit your fellow cosmologists, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4515.36s)]
*  like we were talking about different things and you know we were talking about dark matter and [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4520.8s)]
*  at the time people were interested in self-interacting dark matter. Maybe some [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4524.88s)]
*  people still are, probably they still are, it's an interesting idea. So the simplest dark matter [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4528.32s)]
*  models and again it's always good to sort of base your starting point on the simplest models that [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4533.92s)]
*  are robust and work right and for dark matter that's the cold dark matter model. When you have [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4540.16s)]
*  dark matter particles what that for whatever reason are created in the early universe with [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4546.32s)]
*  very low velocities so they're cold and then they almost don't interact. Maybe they interact a little [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4551.84s)]
*  bit but like weakly interacting massive particles or axions interact completely negligibly in the [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4558.48s)]
*  late universe. And that basic idea, that's the cold dark matter idea and that basically works [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4564.64s)]
*  but it doesn't work exactly and probably it doesn't work exactly. In the sense of working I mean [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4570.0s)]
*  fitting the data that we have from galaxies and clusters and large-scale structure. Probably it [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4577.280000000001s)]
*  doesn't work not because the dark matter is weird but because ordinary matter is weird. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4581.84s)]
*  Ordinary matter has magnetic fields and makes supernovae and has dynamical friction of all [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4586.0s)]
*  sorts and you know it's very very complicated. But when it comes to the centers of galaxies and [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4590.72s)]
*  also satellites around galaxies, substructure and things like that, there's an argument [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4596.0s)]
*  that the predictions from a simple cold dark matter don't exactly fit the data. So maybe you [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4600.96s)]
*  can fix that by having dark matter interact. That means two things. Number one you have to come up [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4605.68s)]
*  with a model of how the dark matter interacts. Is it just you know some new force or something like [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4611.68s)]
*  that. And then number two you better get the relic abundance, the amount of dark matter in [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4616.4s)]
*  the universe. You better get that right and that can be kind of tricky. Okay but so for whatever [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4621.28s)]
*  reason we were talking and I think it was me but I can't 100% promise but I think it was me who said [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4626.24s)]
*  you know I could even imagine a copy of electromagnetism. You know like a version of [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4633.28s)]
*  electromagnetism that is to say a photon like field, a magnetic field, an electric field, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4640.64s)]
*  but not the ones we know and love but a new one that only coupled to dark matter. So there would [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4647.120000000001s)]
*  be a charge in the dark matter sector. You'd have positively charged dark matter, negatively charged [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4653.120000000001s)]
*  matter, but it wouldn't interact with ordinary photons. It would interact with dark photons, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4658.160000000001s)]
*  right? And presumably I remember very vividly that presumably it would have to be a super duper weak [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4662.56s)]
*  interaction. Like the strength of dark electromagnetism would be very very small, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4668.96s)]
*  otherwise you would have noticed it a very long time ago. It would have a like ordinary [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4673.2s)]
*  electromagnetism has a very big effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter. Therefore it's not [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4678.24s)]
*  so weird to suppose that dark electromagnetism would have a big effect on the dynamics of [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4684.4s)]
*  dark matter and we haven't noticed that yet, right? So it would probably be negligible but you know it [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4689.6s)]
*  could be there, who knows. Anyway the idea sort of stuck in my brain. I kept thinking about it. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4693.28s)]
*  When I got back to Caltech I started talking with Lottie Ackerman who was my grad student there at [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4698.16s)]
*  Caltech at the time and we said, yeah let's figure that out. So like your guess is you could have a [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4703.599999999999s)]
*  new copy of electromagnetism that only interacted with dark matter but only if the dark fine [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4711.36s)]
*  structure constant, that is to say the strength of the dark electromagnetic interaction, was very [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4717.36s)]
*  very small. Small enough that you wouldn't have noticed it. So but okay let's figure out exactly [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4722.96s)]
*  how small it could be. Like what are the limits? What is both the particle physics and the astrophysics [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4727.44s)]
*  that you would do to put limits on this idea? So we started working on that and Matt Buckley, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4732.0s)]
*  who was a postdoc there at the time, is now a professor at Rutgers. He was a postdoc working [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4737.919999999999s)]
*  on sort of particle physics and cosmology things. So we started talking with him about the particle [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4742.719999999999s)]
*  physics side of it. How would you use these new interactions to predict the total abundance of [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4747.839999999999s)]
*  things like that? And so we all got moving forward on that and then we realized that there's, we were [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4753.6s)]
*  worried that there was some clever astrophysical cosmological phenomenon that would actually [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4760.160000000001s)]
*  totally rule this out that we didn't know about. So we started talking to Mark Kamienkowski who's a [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4765.04s)]
*  theoretical cosmologist who actually now is like me here at Johns Hopkins. And Mark indeed was the [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4770.320000000001s)]
*  one who came up with the most stringent constraints on this idea. But again it's a fun idea to have [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4777.12s)]
*  because it's once again you get to do all your homework problems, right? You know what is the [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4783.68s)]
*  effect of this on the cosmic microwave background? Can you make dark magnetic fields? Can you make [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4788.5599999999995s)]
*  dark radiation being given off that cools things down? All these things like you get to remember [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4793.68s)]
*  all of your homework problems from undergraduate and graduate school, which is a comforting thing. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4798.24s)]
*  You're in your comfort zone a little bit there. And interestingly the answer we found was that [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4804.32s)]
*  if you did have dark electromagnetism it wouldn't have to be that weak because there's a trade-off [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4811.44s)]
*  what matters for the questions like how much dark radiation do you give off when two particles [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4817.04s)]
*  scatter off of each other. It matters, and this is not at all surprising to real astrophysicists, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4823.04s)]
*  but it wasn't sort of deep into my knowledge base. It depends not only on the strength of [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4828.799999999999s)]
*  electromagnetism but also on the masses of the particles. Heavy particles don't move as much [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4832.88s)]
*  when you give them the same force as a light particle and therefore they don't radiate as much. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4839.4400000000005s)]
*  The fact that electromagnetism is so hugely influential for ordinary matter is only because [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4844.0s)]
*  not only is electromagnetism not too weak but the electron is pretty light. It's 1 [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4850.08s)]
*  1800th the mass of the proton. So as the particle that is charged gets heavier and heavier, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4858.8s)]
*  even though dark electromagnetism might exist, it becomes less and less relevant. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4865.68s)]
*  It becomes less and less noticeable. And once you put the dark particle, the dark matter particle, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4869.68s)]
*  and this is a model where you have both a dark matter particle that is heavy and a new dark [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4874.96s)]
*  photon that is zero mass just like the ordinary photon, if the dark matter particle is up there [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4880.56s)]
*  at a trillion electron volts, which is completely plausible, then the dark electromagnetism isn't [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4885.6s)]
*  that noticeable. It is completely allowed. There's one possible loophole. We did point out in the [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4891.68s)]
*  paper one possible loophole. If there's an instability where you make strong dark magnetic [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4897.280000000001s)]
*  fields, that could cause trouble in dark plasmas. So guess what? There's different ways to get around [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4901.76s)]
*  that as well. So we wrote this paper, Dark Matter and Dark Radiation. The only regret I have, it did [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4908.0s)]
*  well. It's still cited a bunch. People work on the idea, etc. For some reason, the phrase dark [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4914.72s)]
*  photon was co-opted by other ideas. So we called our paper Dark Matter and Dark Radiation. We [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4922.4800000000005s)]
*  should have called it Dark Particles and Dark Photons or something like that, or Dark Matter [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  and Dark Photons, because the ordinary photon is a massless particle that is based on a U1 gauge [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4932.16s)]
*  symmetry. There is something called the Z boson, which is a massive particle that is also neutral [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4939.68s)]
*  and based on an SU2 gauge symmetry. For some reason, the phrase dark photon has been adopted [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4947.12s)]
*  by models where there is a new U1 gauge boson, but is massive. So that is not our dark photon. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4953.200000000001s)]
*  Our dark photon would be truly massless. There would truly be dark magnetic fields in the whole [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4963.04s)]
*  bit. But there is a burgeoning industry right now in searching for dark photons. You can Google dark [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4967.76s)]
*  photon and find a bunch of people looking for them. They're not looking for our particle. They're [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4973.12s)]
*  looking for massive new U1 gauge bosons that are out there doing other things. So still, it was a [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4977.12s)]
*  hit. People liked it. I was proud of it, having worked it out, learned a lot. Again, made a mistake [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4984.16s)]
*  in the original version of the paper, had to put forward a revised version because there was... [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4989.76s)]
*  No, is that true? No, I made a mistake in a different paper. Never mind. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4995.280000000001s)]
*  There were Feynman diagrams in these papers. Even though I love Feynman diagrams, I only actually [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=4998.56s)]
*  use them in my research once every 10 years. So I have to completely relearn what to do, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5002.88s)]
*  get the formulas right, and I tend to make mistakes if my collaborators are not keeping a sharp eye on [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5008.240000000001s)]
*  me. So in the dark radiation paper, I don't think we made any mistakes. There's a couple others that [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5013.4400000000005s)]
*  we goofed. That's okay. You goof, people tell you. You submit the revised version. As long as you [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5017.04s)]
*  eventually get it right, I think I'm happy with that. So let me move on to a miss. That was a 2008 [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5021.2s)]
*  paper. There's a miss. Again, the miss means I love this paper, but it didn't quite set the [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5026.5599999999995s)]
*  world on fire. And this was called Dynamical Compactification from De Sitter Space. You see, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5032.0s)]
*  De Sitter Space is a theme that appears again and again here. So this is a paper I wrote with Matt [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5037.599999999999s)]
*  Johnson, who is now at Perimeter Institute and also Waterloo. I forget the University of Waterloo. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5044.24s)]
*  And Lisa Randall, who of course is a famous physicist. Lisa was visiting Caltech at the time, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5050.96s)]
*  and I'd known Lisa for many years. And Matt was a postdoc at Caltech at the time. He was a graduate [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5056.24s)]
*  student in Santa Cruz with Anthony Aguirre, former Mindscape guest. So you always got to point out [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5063.2s)]
*  the connections to former Mindscape guests. So anyway, Matt and Lisa and I wrote a couple papers [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5067.92s)]
*  together, one on extremal black holes, which was fun. And that actually did get some citations. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5072.56s)]
*  This one I thought was really interesting and important and yet didn't make a big splash. So [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5078.32s)]
*  you tell me why. I don't know. Here's the question. Imagine you believe that there are extra [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5083.44s)]
*  dimensions of space, okay? And these extra dimensions, in addition to the three that we [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5090.16s)]
*  know and love, are somehow curled up, compactified, and hidden from us. What is the cosmological [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5094.24s)]
*  evolution of that story? How do they become compactified in the first place? The usual answer [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5099.84s)]
*  is something like the following. In the early universe, perhaps all of the dimensions were [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5107.12s)]
*  compact, right? And there is a famous mechanism, the Brandenberger-Waffa mechanism, named after [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5113.84s)]
*  Robert Brandenberger and Kormun Waffa, another previous Mindscape guest. And they showed that [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5119.92s)]
*  if you had nine plus one dimensional space time, which is what string theory wants, you could [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5125.44s)]
*  imagine if all nine of those dimensions were curled up, the three of them would become uncurled and [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5130.72s)]
*  start expanding and make a big bang like ours. It's kind of a very cool cosmological mechanism. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5136.8s)]
*  I quite, it's one of those ideas when I heard it, I was like, I'm really sad I didn't think of that [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5142.320000000001s)]
*  idea first. That's when that was an awesome idea. But it's also from my, you know, current [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5146.320000000001s)]
*  perspective as someone who cares about the early universe and the arrow of time, entirely cheating. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5151.76s)]
*  Like, why were any of the dimensions small? What you really should ask is if none of the [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5156.8s)]
*  dimensions were small, could you make some small, right? Rather than starting with them all small [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5162.48s)]
*  and asking, can you make some big? If you start with all of them big, can you make some small? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5167.36s)]
*  No one had apparently addressed that question as far as I could tell. And we didn't address it. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5171.679999999999s)]
*  So we wrote down a model in which we showed that you could indeed make extra dimensions small, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5176.799999999999s)]
*  make, well, make ordinary dimensions small. This seems really hard to do from a simple [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5182.24s)]
*  visualization perspective. If I, if you think about a piece of paper, but a piece of paper [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5187.52s)]
*  that is infinitely big, okay, so a plane, and you want to curl it up into a cylinder. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5193.280000000001s)]
*  So that one dimension is still long and the other dimension is small because it's the [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5200.320000000001s)]
*  circle dimension that's wrapped up around the cylinder. How do you do that? The paper is [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5203.92s)]
*  infinitely big, the plane goes on forever. It seems like it would take an infinitely big conspiracy [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5208.88s)]
*  for all of space time to go from a plane to a curled up cylinder, right? That just seems hard. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5213.28s)]
*  Of course, the answer is if you start with a plane, you don't curl up the whole thing, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5218.5599999999995s)]
*  you dig a hole. What you can do is take a region of that plane and you can sort of extrude it [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5222.88s)]
*  so that it looks like a cylinder that is attached to the plane in the shape of one of these pictures [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5229.12s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen of what a black hole space time looks like, right? And indeed, there are [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5234.88s)]
*  space times that are black hole like or black holes, but you put extra things in there, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5240.160000000001s)]
*  extra gauge fields and things like that, where rather than things curling into kind of a funnel [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5244.240000000001s)]
*  and then stopping at a singularity, they curl into a funnel and then as we showed in our paper, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5249.92s)]
*  you can smoothly match that onto a cylinder that is a generalization of a cylinder so that the [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5256.8s)]
*  extra curled up dimension is not just a single circle, but a two dimensional sphere. I'd [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5263.84s)]
*  previously written a paper with James Gaddis and Bob Wald where we talked about compactifying and [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5268.8s)]
*  stabilizing two dimensional spheres, so that's something I knew how to do. So anyway, that is a [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5274.4800000000005s)]
*  way that you could have an n dimensional space generate a region dynamically, which was n minus [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5282.24s)]
*  two dimensional in macroscopic size and then two dimensional in the little sphere that is wrapped [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5291.360000000001s)]
*  around. So you take a region of n dimensional space and there's a quantum fluctuation and it [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5296.56s)]
*  turns into an n minus two dimensional space times a two dimensional sphere. I'm sorry this is getting [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5302.080000000001s)]
*  too technical, but I can't draw pictures, it's an audio podcast, what do you want me to do? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5308.320000000001s)]
*  And what we showed is that the ingredients you need for this are kind of minimal. You start with [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5313.4400000000005s)]
*  dissitter space, again a space with a positive cosmological constant and you start with an [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5320.400000000001s)]
*  electromagnetic field. That's it, a good old U1 gauge boson, a good old electricity magnetism. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5324.32s)]
*  If you have six dimensional dissitter space and you just allow for quantum fluctuations, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5331.5199999999995s)]
*  this is actually an area where we mostly do have control over the equations. It's not 100% [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5338.16s)]
*  because it's still quantum gravity in some sense, but it's in a regime where we think we [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5344.48s)]
*  understand what's going on. And there will be dynamical quantum fluctuations into [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5348.8s)]
*  little tubes that look like four dimensional space time with a compactified two dimensional sphere. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5356.24s)]
*  So to me that's like really cool and plausibly even part of reality as far as I know. You would [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5362.88s)]
*  have to do a lot more. We talked about in the paper, one mistake we made in that paper was it [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5369.2s)]
*  was too long. Like it was really, it should have been two papers. It should have been one paper on [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5372.88s)]
*  the classical solutions and a separate paper on the quantum fluctuations into them. But I don't [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5376.72s)]
*  know, we just got happy writing the paper and it got too long. And a lot of this was done by Matt, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5382.320000000001s)]
*  I should say. I should give credit to the people who actually do this. You know, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5388.4800000000005s)]
*  Lisa and I absolutely contribute to the ideas, but a lot of the calculational heavy lifting [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5391.04s)]
*  came from Matt in this one. And I think that people just don't really like dissitter space. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5394.88s)]
*  I think that the modern view of quantum gravity, which is dominated by string theory, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5402.24s)]
*  is one where anti-dissitter space and even Minkowski space to a lesser extent make perfect sense [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5406.48s)]
*  and dissitter space seems weird to us. Even though it's close to where we live, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5413.04s)]
*  it's something we don't understand nearly as well. But and also we didn't do any, you know, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5417.5199999999995s)]
*  we didn't show how you could dynamically compactify onto some six dimensional Calabi-Al manifold or [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5422.4s)]
*  anything like that, which is something that string theorists might be very interested in. But [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5428.0s)]
*  the general idea of starting from a big universe and making one with fewer spatial dimensions, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5431.76s)]
*  I think is very interesting. And I'm surprised that was a bit of a miss citations wise. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5436.72s)]
*  Now we're going to move on to two final examples from, I guess, the late Caltech period, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5442.16s)]
*  if you want to put it that way. At that time, you know, I had in the beginning of my Caltech period, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5447.2s)]
*  I was really sort of sort of looking for a better research direction, sort of still moving in the [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5453.2s)]
*  momentum that I had built up from Chicago doing things like extra dimensions and dark energy and [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5459.92s)]
*  inflationary cosmology and stuff like that. But I was becoming less and less into that and trying [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5465.84s)]
*  to become more foundational, right, trying to think about how to really think deeply about the [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5472.88s)]
*  laws of physics and how to be more fundamental and innovative and creative about where they could [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5477.76s)]
*  come from rather than just writing down more scalar fields and having them push around the [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5483.92s)]
*  universe. And fortunately, that was becoming a thing, right, in theoretical physics more generally. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5488.88s)]
*  And honestly, like the five years before the pandemic, we had a great little group built up [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5493.76s)]
*  with myself and a bunch of graduate students, Kim Boddy, who is now, I'm not going to start listing [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5501.04s)]
*  everyone who's now faculty members, all the students there did very well in terms of getting [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5508.08s)]
*  faculty jobs. So that's good. But Kim Boddy was there, Jason Pollock, Aidan Chatwin Davis, Grant [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5511.6s)]
*  Remen, Tony Bartolotta, Charles Tsao, Ashmeet Singh, as well as post-docs like Stefan Leichenauer, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5517.04s)]
*  Ning Bao, Spiros Mikolakis. So a bunch of people and we all had these weekly group meetings on, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5525.36s)]
*  I forget what we called it, something like modern quantum cosmology or something like that, the [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5532.56s)]
*  emergence of space and time and other people came from other groups to sit in. And so we had this [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5536.56s)]
*  ongoing rambling conversation about the emergence of space-time, especially on the basis of quantum [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5542.8s)]
*  information, right? The whole it from qubit paradigm or idea was growing in interest in that time. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5549.360000000001s)]
*  And mostly it was in the context of ADS-CFT, the anti-decider space conformal field theory [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5556.0s)]
*  correspondence. And my always angle has been, well, I don't know, this is giving myself too much [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5563.76s)]
*  credit, but I've never put any effort into the single thing that everyone else was trying to do [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5569.76s)]
*  at the same time. So it's important to do things that have an impact and are considered to be [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5575.04s)]
*  interesting by the rest of the field, but it's not important to chase bandwagons simply for the [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5580.72s)]
*  sake of being on the bandwagon. So I love the idea that was emerging from ADS-CFT that quantum [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5586.24s)]
*  information and entanglement were somehow at the heart of space-time. That comes from people like [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5592.08s)]
*  Mark van Rommstank and Brian Swingle and so forth, as well as a bunch of people [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5597.76s)]
*  doing tensor networks. But I wanted to do it more in the real world, right? More in the decider [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5603.4400000000005s)]
*  space side of things rather than anti-decider space side of things. So we did a bunch of different [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5609.68s)]
*  things. And the hit that came out of that, maybe a couple hits came out of that. This is another hit [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5614.08s)]
*  that I could have mentioned would have been my paper with Chip Sieben on deriving the Born rule [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5621.12s)]
*  in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. But I don't want to talk forever. So [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5625.28s)]
*  like I said, I had to cut some of my favorites. But thinking about that one, which I guess was [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5630.16s)]
*  from, what year was that from? Like 2014? That sort of set me on the path. But from thinking about [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5635.84s)]
*  this philosophy question, where does probability come from in the many worlds interpretation of [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5644.48s)]
*  quantum mechanics, I had started thinking more deeply about the ontology of the many worlds [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5649.76s)]
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is just, there is a wave function and it obeys the [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5656.16s)]
*  Schrodinger equation. As anyone who has heard me talk about this, has read something deeply hidden, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5660.320000000001s)]
*  or has seen any of my videos about it, knows that is the essence of the many worlds interpretation. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5665.360000000001s)]
*  And there's plenty of philosophical questions that pop up from that. But I think there are also [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5672.0s)]
*  physics questions. If the world is just a wave function evolving in Hilbert space according to [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5677.36s)]
*  the Schrodinger equation, why does the world look like space and time and stuff and all that? So [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5682.48s)]
*  that became really the fundamental driving question in my research. And now 10 years later, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5689.04s)]
*  it still is. I'm still trying to figure out. There's other questions that have gotten added [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5694.639999999999s)]
*  to that, but that's still a very deep question. And so we had this group of people who would just [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5699.36s)]
*  meet and just talk about all sorts of things. Where does space come from? Where does time come [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5704.56s)]
*  from? Where does gravity come from? Where does entanglement come from? Where do fields come from? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5708.240000000001s)]
*  Right? And we ended up writing lots of papers about lots of different things. And the biggest hits to [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5711.76s)]
*  come out of that were, of course, one paper I wrote with Charles Tsao and Spiros Mykalakis on [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5716.72s)]
*  space from Hilbert space, recovering geometry from bulk entanglement. And then a follow up that Charles [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5722.64s)]
*  and I did by ourselves called bulk entanglement gravity without a boundary towards finding [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5728.88s)]
*  Einstein's equation in Hilbert space. OK, these are all big buzzwords. What is going on here? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5733.44s)]
*  Well, the idea was that if you didn't put the metric of space time in by hand, that is to say, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5740.0s)]
*  let's let's back up even more. The usual way that in physics, we derive a quantum theory of [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5749.2s)]
*  something quantum theory of the hydrogen atom or the harmonic oscillator or the electromagnetic [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5756.24s)]
*  field or whatever, is to start with a classical theory and quantize it. So doing gravity, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5760.48s)]
*  doing quantum gravity, you would ordinarily start with Einstein's general theory of relativity and [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5766.48s)]
*  quantize it. If instead you're doing something like string theory, you're just taking a different [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5770.959999999999s)]
*  classical theory and quantizing it. You're still writing down some classical degrees of freedom. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5776.32s)]
*  There are strings traveling through space time or the curvature of space time itself in general [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5781.44s)]
*  relativity and you're trying to quantize that classical thing. So the thing that hit me by [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5786.96s)]
*  thinking deeply about many worlds and so forth was you shouldn't really be doing that. You should [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5791.84s)]
*  be starting with the vector in Hilbert space, the wave function, the quantum thing, and you should [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5797.36s)]
*  be deriving a classical image, whatever that image is from that quantum thing. So the space from [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5802.32s)]
*  Hilbert space program as it were was to say how could you have a quantum state that didn't have [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5811.36s)]
*  space and time built into it or we actually had time built into it. We just kept time as a [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5817.44s)]
*  fundamental variable for this particular work. That's a separate set of questions we could also ask [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5822.719999999999s)]
*  and we did talk about that but not a lot came out of it. By the way, a whole bunch of papers came [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5828.639999999999s)]
*  out of this group, many of which didn't have my name on it because of course everyone else is also [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5832.719999999999s)]
*  talking to each other and writing papers which is good. That's great. That's when things are going [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5837.28s)]
*  well. That's how it is. So Ashmead I know wrote a paper on emergent time that I was not part of. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5841.84s)]
*  So this paper with Charles and Spiros was about emergent space and we use the entanglement between [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5847.84s)]
*  some abstract quantum degrees of freedom to figure out whether or not you could turn the [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5854.32s)]
*  entanglement structure into a metric structure. The basic idea just comes from quantum field [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5860.16s)]
*  theory and quantum field theory. It is a known fact that if you're in the ground state, if you're [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5865.52s)]
*  in the vacuum, nothing going on, then there is entanglement between quantum degrees of freedom [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5869.52s)]
*  in different parts of space and the entanglement is very high when they're nearby and it's very low [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5874.64s)]
*  when they're far away. So there's a relationship between the amount of entanglement and the spatial [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5879.52s)]
*  geometry. So we just had the idea, let's turn that on its head, rather than saying here's the distance, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5884.88s)]
*  I can calculate the entanglement. Let's say here's the entanglement. Let me assert that I can treat [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5890.72s)]
*  that entanglement as a measure of distance. Does it work? Does it hang together? And so in our first [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  paper we said, well, if it hangs together and you can make these extra assumptions, here's how you [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5901.68s)]
*  can actually derive an equation that should be obeyed by that emergent geometry and the equation [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5907.12s)]
*  in the linear regime where gravity is weak turns out to be Einstein's equation. It's kind of, I like [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5913.280000000001s)]
*  to emphasize this, it's not as impressive as it sounds when you put it that way because there [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5918.88s)]
*  aren't that many equations for space-time curvature that you might possibly want to posit. Getting [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5924.24s)]
*  Einstein's equation out is actually pretty natural. What's impressive is that you can get it out without [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5930.4800000000005s)]
*  even starting with a metric at all, right, with starting with completely quantum degrees of freedom. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5935.6s)]
*  And in the follow-up paper, in both papers we used ideas from Ted Jacobson. Ted had written [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5942.0s)]
*  some papers, he wrote a very famous paper called the Einstein equation of state where he said if [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5948.56s)]
*  instead of positing Einstein's equation in space-time you posit a relationship between entropy [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5954.64s)]
*  across a surface and the area of that surface. And of course you can derive the entropy area [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5961.200000000001s)]
*  relationship for a black hole in semi-classical general relativity, but Ted again turned it [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5967.6s)]
*  backwards and said let's posit the entropy area relationship and derive Einstein's equation. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5973.200000000001s)]
*  Of course he worked in a framework where you had a space-time and a metric, right, and so we were [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5978.400000000001s)]
*  saying you don't have that, all you have is entanglement, but can you do the same thing? And [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5983.52s)]
*  we argued that the answer was yes. And it's not, so it's not going to be as ever super, well it's [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5986.96s)]
*  not right now going to be a super popular approach because we are just in the bulk of space-time. We [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=5994.88s)]
*  are working in the regime where there's no black holes, there's no cosmology, there's no boundary at [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6001.76s)]
*  infinity. We're trying to ask why the earth goes around the sun and apples fall from trees, right? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6006.96s)]
*  In that regime you can treat gravity as sort of an ordinary local field theory and that's the thing [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6014.24s)]
*  you want to get derived from your underlying quantum structure. So that's important, but it's not [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6018.88s)]
*  for many people as sexy or cool as doing the holographic thing in the ADS-CFT context. And so [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6024.72s)]
*  it has gotten a good amount of attention later on, but it's not yet swept the [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6033.28s)]
*  attention of the entire rest of the community. I think that's actually perfectly okay. Like I said [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6040.64s)]
*  before, I'm slow and both of these papers, one from 2016, one from 2017, they were a little [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6045.12s)]
*  hand-wavy to be perfectly honest, right? We were suggesting, well if this is true, if that's true, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6054.8s)]
*  then we can show that the following things will happen. But there are many, many steps that remain [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6059.12s)]
*  to be filled in. So in the best possible reading, this approach to quantum gravity is in the state [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6064.08s)]
*  that string theory maybe was in in 1972 or something like that, where you had a basic idea, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6070.96s)]
*  there were some vaguely plausible aspects to it, but there were some crucial steps you had to [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6076.64s)]
*  demonstrate would work before other people would say, oh wait, that is a promising approach, let's [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6081.84s)]
*  sort of jump on that and see how far we can go. So me and my collaborators are still thinking [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6088.08s)]
*  about that, how to sort of make it more respectable, fill in some of the gaps so maybe other people can [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6093.68s)]
*  jump on a bandwagon that we start. That is the ultimate goal. And then the final paper I want [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6099.04s)]
*  to talk about in terms of the misses from that period, again I'm looking for ones that are [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6104.08s)]
*  I personally love but have not made a huge impact. So I'm going to talk about a paper called [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6109.28s)]
*  Branches of the Black Hole Wave Function Need Not Contain Firewalls by Ning Bao, myself, Aidan, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6114.72s)]
*  Chatwin Davis, Jason Pollock, and Grant Remen. So the idea here was, this is 2017, it's a little bit [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6120.96s)]
*  past but it's still in the period where people were super into this thing called the firewall [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6128.240000000001s)]
*  paradox. The firewall paradox is put forward in a paper called AMPS, A-M-P-S, Almeri, Marolf, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6135.92s)]
*  Polchinski, and Sully. And it purported to be a puzzle paradox in our understanding of black hole [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6143.92s)]
*  information loss. And the idea is, of course, people argue over whether or not black hole [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6152.64s)]
*  evaporation really does conserve information. Black holes radiate, Stephen Hawking says this, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6159.6s)]
*  back in the 1970s, but they radiate in a way that is completely the same no matter what went into [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6165.76s)]
*  making the black hole. You can throw in books full of information if you trust Hawking's [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6171.68s)]
*  calculation of how the information gets out, how the radiation gets out. The outgoing radiation [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6176.320000000001s)]
*  knows nothing about the specific information that was in the book you sent into the black hole, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6181.76s)]
*  so that information seems to be destroyed. Now maybe it is destroyed, that's absolutely [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6187.04s)]
*  possible, that's what Hawking himself said, but most people, especially those trained in quantum [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6191.280000000001s)]
*  field theory, are just used to the laws of physics not destroying information. Modulo, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6196.48s)]
*  interestingly, the fact that when you measure a quantum system, its wave function collapses and [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6201.919999999999s)]
*  information is destroyed, right? I don't think that's really destroying information because I [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6206.799999999999s)]
*  think that there's unitary, smooth, reversible, deterministic evolution of the wave function [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6212.32s)]
*  according to the Schrodinger equation. There is apparent loss of information because the wave [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6218.16s)]
*  function branches and you find yourself on one branch or the other not being able to know which [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6223.28s)]
*  one ahead of time, and that's not what everyone believes. Some people believe that the information [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6227.36s)]
*  really is lost when you make a quantum measurement. It's weird because there are some people who think [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6234.24s)]
*  that information is lost when you make a quantum measurement, but they're very bothered by the idea [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6238.16s)]
*  that the black hole radiation would destroy information. That doesn't quite make sense to me, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6243.36s)]
*  but on my side of things I think that neither one of those really destroys information, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6248.4s)]
*  so we should try to understand how the information gets out. We've talked about that with people like [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6252.88s)]
*  Neda Engelhardt, for example. I should actually name check Neda Engelhardt and Rafael Buso, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6259.04s)]
*  two former Mindscape guests, teamed up on a paper on entropy in curved spacetimes that was crucially [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6266.400000000001s)]
*  important to the paper that Aidan and I wrote on the cosmic no hair theorem and the second law of [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6273.4400000000005s)]
*  thermodynamics. So like the Netscape family tree is everywhere here. Okay, anyway, as Rafael Buso, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6279.28s)]
*  in fact, who said to me when soon after the firewall paradox came online, he said like, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6286.639999999999s)]
*  oh yeah, you got to drop everything, start working on this. This is the most important thing. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6292.96s)]
*  I didn't immediately drop everything and start working on it, but eventually I became interested. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6297.28s)]
*  So here's the paradox. You think that entropy is that information is not destroyed. I'm not going [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6300.719999999999s)]
*  to debate that, but maybe information is not destroyed. Let's assume that it's not. Okay, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6306.88s)]
*  but you think that otherwise somehow radiation is emitted from black holes. The trick is supposed [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6311.52s)]
*  to be that you are imagining that the radiation that comes out has entanglement in such a way as [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6316.64s)]
*  to not destroy the quantum information that originally went into the black hole. So the [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6323.76s)]
*  entanglement between different photons emitted as part of the radiation coming out due to Hawking [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6328.16s)]
*  radiation has to be exactly precisely arranged so that it contains the same amount of quantum [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6333.84s)]
*  information as the stuff that went in. Okay, now there's a whole separate problem about how it [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6339.92s)]
*  actually gets there. That's the real black hole information loss puzzle. How does the entanglement [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6344.88s)]
*  quantum information that went into the black hole get to the radiation that's going out? But let's [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6349.68s)]
*  put that aside for the second. Let's imagine somehow it does. Okay, that was the state of the art in [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6354.64s)]
*  the mid-20 teens. And here is the puzzle pointed out by Amps. They said to get the information out [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6359.12s)]
*  requires that a photon in the Hawking radiation that is emitted relatively early after you've [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6368.24s)]
*  made the black hole. There's a lot of radiation comes out early. There's a lot of radiation that [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6375.2s)]
*  comes out late when the black hole is smaller. And in order to make all the information comes out, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6380.24s)]
*  those two bits of information have to be entangled with each other. Early photons have [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6386.32s)]
*  to be entangled with later photons, okay, in order to keep all the quantum information coming out in [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6391.84s)]
*  the right magnitude. Okay, that's fine. I can get that. But also, if you go back to what Hawking [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6397.679999999999s)]
*  said originally about the origin of Hawking radiation, and you think about any one photon [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6404.32s)]
*  of Hawking radiation be emitted near the black hole, the story that you're told is that one [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6409.759999999999s)]
*  photon escapes and becomes Hawking radiation. Another photon falls into the black hole, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6416.08s)]
*  and that ingoing photon from the point of view of an external observer has a negative energy, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6422.08s)]
*  which is why the black hole eventually shrinks and evaporates away. Third, you're told that when you [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6426.8s)]
*  are near the event horizon of the black hole just falling in, you see nothing. There's nothing [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6433.44s)]
*  special, right? In classical general relativity, if you buy my general relativity textbook and you [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6438.48s)]
*  read about black holes, you will be told there's no special signposts there at the event horizon of [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6443.68s)]
*  the black hole. And what that means is that there's a certain amount of entanglement between the [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6449.360000000001s)]
*  ingoing photon and the outgoing photon. In fact, they have to be as entangled as they can get. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6455.12s)]
*  The phrase that is bandied about here is the monogamy of entanglement. If you have an outgoing [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6461.52s)]
*  photon that is maximally entangled with an ingoing photon, which is what you need for everything to [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6468.32s)]
*  look like empty space, nothing special going on at the event horizon, then that outgoing photon cannot [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6474.16s)]
*  also be entangled with anyone else. Black holes, degrees of quantum information do not cheat on [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6480.32s)]
*  each other. They are monogamous. If you are maximally entangled with one other degree of [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6487.2s)]
*  quantum information, then you can't be entangled with anybody else. But we just said you should be. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6491.36s)]
*  We just said that the outgoing photon at late times has to be entangled with an outgoing photon [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6496.16s)]
*  at early times, but it can't be because it's maximally entangled with an ingoing photon in order [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6501.2s)]
*  for everything to look smooth at the event horizon. So how do you get out of this? And the Amps paper [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6506.5599999999995s)]
*  said, well, we don't know what actually happens, but look, one possibility is that the information [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6512.72s)]
*  does get out. So the early photons are maximally entangled with the late photons, and we just [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6518.72s)]
*  have to bite the bullet and say that the late photons, that none of the photons are maximally [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6526.08s)]
*  entangled with ingoing photons, which means that at the event horizon, it is not empty space. It [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6531.12s)]
*  does not look completely like there's no black hole there. Rather, there is an energy barrier [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6537.44s)]
*  right there at the event horizon, because the quantum state is not that of empty space. It's [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6544.64s)]
*  not that of the Minkowski vacuum, as we would say. And so that is the so-called firewall. They said, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6548.64s)]
*  in order to get the information out without losing information, there needs to be a firewall [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6553.52s)]
*  at the event horizon, apparently. So of course, many people argued about this. Lenny Suskind, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6559.040000000001s)]
*  who was another Mindscape guest, did a lot of work on this question, and Raphael did, of course, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6564.72s)]
*  and others. And I'm not sure, this is the beginning, by the way. This was the inspiration, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6569.6s)]
*  ultimately, for the ER equals EPR suggestion by Suskind and Juan Maldacena, that there's a [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6575.040000000001s)]
*  relationship between entanglement and wormholes in the space time, ER being the Einstein Rosen [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6581.92s)]
*  paper that proposed wormholes in 1935, and EPR being the Einstein-Podolsky Rosen paper that [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6587.6s)]
*  proposed entanglement back in 1935. So there's been a lot of work inspired by the firewalls [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6594.16s)]
*  paradox. But I, of course, was bugged by this thing that I already mentioned, that measurements [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6599.68s)]
*  already collapse the wave function and seemingly violate information conservation. We know they [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6608.320000000001s)]
*  don't really, if you believe in many worlds, but would it help at all to take that seriously, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6614.080000000001s)]
*  the fact that when you do a quantum measurement, it makes the wave function apparently collapse [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6620.400000000001s)]
*  and apparently lose information. So just by thinking about that and by talking to my friends, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6625.040000000001s)]
*  who were mostly grad students of mine, Ning Bao was a postdoc at the time, and thinking about [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6630.160000000001s)]
*  what it meant, here's what we realized. So if you have two particles that are entangled, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6635.92s)]
*  you have the traditional Alice and Bob setup, right? So Alice has a particle, Bob has a particle, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6641.84s)]
*  the particles are entangled with each other, and the usual thing you would say is if Alice measures [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6647.36s)]
*  her particle, now you know what happens to Bob's particle. Okay, so if Alice's particles spin up [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6652.72s)]
*  and the two particles are entangled in such a way that the spins are opposite, you instantly [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6658.88s)]
*  know that Bob's particle is spin down. But there's another thing you know, which is that after you do [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6662.88s)]
*  the measurement, there's no longer any more entanglement between Alice's particle and Bob's [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6667.92s)]
*  particle. You start it out in a state where it was one over the square root of two, Alice's particle [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6673.76s)]
*  is spin up and Bob's is spin down, plus one over the square root of two, Alice's is spin down and [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6680.08s)]
*  Bob's is spin up. So that's an entangled state for the two particles. After you do the measurement, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6685.36s)]
*  you have Alice's is up, Bob's is down. That's not entangled, that's two separate quantum states. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6691.04s)]
*  Okay, where did the entanglement go? The answer is that what is entangled with other, what else in [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6696.72s)]
*  the universe depends on what part of the wave function you're looking at. Are you looking at [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6704.96s)]
*  the whole wave function or are you looking at a branch of the wave function? So in the many world [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6710.56s)]
*  story, when Alice measures her particle, there's part of Alice that measures spin up on one branch, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6717.92s)]
*  part of Alice that measures spin down on the other branch, and that whole shebang, Alice and her [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6723.04s)]
*  particle are in the global wave function of the universe still entangled with Bob and his particle. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6729.4400000000005s)]
*  But when you specialize to being on one branch or the other by decoherence and things like that, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6736.8s)]
*  on each branch it looks like they are not entangled anymore. Okay, so there's a very, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6743.6s)]
*  very elementary simple thing about quantum mechanics, nothing fancy about quantum gravity, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6748.64s)]
*  but whether or not two subsystems of the universe are entangled with each other can have a different [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6753.2s)]
*  answer depending on whether you're saying, do you mean in the global wave function of the universe [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6758.72s)]
*  or do you just mean on a branch? And remember, the global wave function of the universe is what obeys [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6764.32s)]
*  the Schrodinger equation and is where everything lives, but branches are where people live, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6770.24s)]
*  branches are where observers live, branches are what you measure. Okay, and so what we realized is [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6775.5199999999995s)]
*  when you're saying the late photon has to simultaneously be entangled with an early photon [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6782.08s)]
*  and with an ingoing photon, and that's not okay, but those entanglements are relative to two [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6791.36s)]
*  different questions. The question about the entanglement between the early photon and the [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6798.0s)]
*  late photon is a question about the global wave function of the universe. Overall is information [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6802.96s)]
*  conserved, nothing about branching or decoherence or measurement outcomes or anything like that. In [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6809.44s)]
*  the overall wave function of the universe is there entanglement between the early photons and the [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6815.52s)]
*  late photons, whereas the question about what happens near the horizon, what is the entanglement [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6820.64s)]
*  of the outgoing photon and the ingoing photon, is that enough to be restoring the sort of boringness, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6828.320000000001s)]
*  the no drama condition as it was labeled in the Amps paper near the event horizon? That's a question [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6835.6s)]
*  about a branch of the wave function, not the global wave function. In particular, you send in an [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6842.400000000001s)]
*  observer, you throw an observer into the black hole and you're asking the question, do they see [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6848.32s)]
*  a firewall, which is a question that can be translated operationally into do the quantum [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6853.92s)]
*  measurements that those observers do reveal the existence of a firewall or does it look like empty [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6859.92s)]
*  space? Now we're not able to sort of definitively answer that question in a very precise quantitative [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6865.36s)]
*  way, but we tried our best to make the argument that it was possible as far as anyone knows [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6873.04s)]
*  that there are enough branches of the quantum wave function that no one of them contains a firewall. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6879.84s)]
*  In other words, that there are so many branches, because branching happens all the time, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6885.12s)]
*  there's so many branches you can throw in as many observers as you want and they would not see any [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6889.12s)]
*  firewalls when you went into the black hole, even though all the external outgoing photons are [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6894.32s)]
*  entangled with other photons so that all the information is eventually conserved. I know I'm [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6900.56s)]
*  talking this is very high level abstract stuff for people who are not physicists, but it's late, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6905.360000000001s)]
*  it's a holiday message anyway. I'm not working too hard. This would take, I could try to make it even [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6909.200000000001s)]
*  more understandable, but that would take a lot more words. I don't really have that many words [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6914.72s)]
*  in me right now. Sorry about that. Anyway, so we suggested that maybe there wasn't, well, what we [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6918.080000000001s)]
*  suggested was there was a logical loophole in the argument for firewalls that had been given by [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6924.96s)]
*  Amps. Whether the universe actually takes advantage of that loophole or not is much less clear to me. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6931.84s)]
*  In this paper, yeah, you know, it got a few citations, but it certainly didn't [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6938.4800000000005s)]
*  count as in anyone's mind as a solution to the firewall paradox or get nearly as many [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6942.16s)]
*  citations as it would have if it had. I think we were a little bit on the tail end of the firewall [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6946.16s)]
*  paradox discussion. And also I think the people were, you know, when this happens in physics also, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6952.16s)]
*  when there's a bunch of people who are working in an area and they're thinking about a problem, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6961.599999999999s)]
*  they get a feeling for sort of what kind of solution will look reasonable to them, right? [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6967.2s)]
*  What is the kind of solution you'll expect the cosmological constant problem or the problem of [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6973.76s)]
*  quantizing gravity or what the dark matter is or whatever. And when you suggest something that is [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6978.0s)]
*  kind of orthogonal to that a little bit saying, well, maybe it's a different angle of attack that [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6982.48s)]
*  you should be taking, you have to work harder to convince people that you're on the right track. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6987.52s)]
*  And I think that our paper, you know, suggested there was a loophole there, but it didn't quite [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6992.16s)]
*  close the loophole or really argue that the loophole was taken advantage of by the universe [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=6996.48s)]
*  well enough to convince many people. So I thought the paper was really good. It didn't make as much [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7002.32s)]
*  of a splash as I had hoped. But you know, so what you do in that situation, young scientists out there, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7007.36s)]
*  this is probably going to happen to you too, that you write a paper you're very proud of and people [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7012.5599999999995s)]
*  don't quite pay attention to it as much as you want. Your job is to work harder now, write a [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7016.4s)]
*  follow-up paper, write other papers, develop the ideas further, show that they really do solve the [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7022.0s)]
*  problems that you care about, figure out what the implications are, the consequences of this, and [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7026.719999999999s)]
*  advertise it widely. So I've been thinking about this paper again recently. This is one of the [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7032.8s)]
*  inspirations for a paper, I think I told you, that is still hasn't come out yet, but will come out [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7038.96s)]
*  soon by myself and Chris Chalhoux at Harvard on what Hawking radiation looks like when you fall [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7044.08s)]
*  into a black hole. It was really following up on this firewalls paper that started us asking that [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7050.0s)]
*  question. And I've been thinking since then about how should we think about quantum systems that [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7055.68s)]
*  are outside our past light cone? Does the wave function of the universe branch everywhere [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7064.88s)]
*  throughout space simultaneously, or does it only branch within our past light cone, if you're a [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7070.4800000000005s)]
*  believer in ever-ating quantum mechanics? I'm not sure exactly how to ask that question in the [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7074.400000000001s)]
*  context of quantum gravity, but I think that it's a question that deserves asking. I think that in [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7079.68s)]
*  other words, the reason why I think it's important is we physicists, despite the fact that we learn [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7085.84s)]
*  quantum mechanics, we always think of the world classically at the end of the day. We think of [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7091.280000000001s)]
*  the world as classical physics plus some occasional jumps, right? Now not always, not strictly speaking, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7095.76s)]
*  but like in our heart of hearts we do that. And as evidence for this, when you think about either the [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7102.08s)]
*  black hole information problem or cosmology, eternal inflation, things like that, people are [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7106.88s)]
*  constantly turning quantum wave functions into realizations of stochastic processes. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7113.76s)]
*  So if you have a quantum wave function that is a superposition of spin up and spin down, and you [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7122.64s)]
*  have a thousand of them and you measure, you're going to get some number of spin up and some [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7127.28s)]
*  numbers of spin down, but you know, anyone who's been listening to this podcast knows there's a [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7131.76s)]
*  difference between the wave function before you've measured it and then the wave function after you [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7136.4800000000005s)]
*  measured it and you got all that measurement outcomes. It's collapsed onto some particular [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7140.72s)]
*  possibility. And yet we're constantly talking about other parts of the multiverse as if their [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7144.0s)]
*  wave functions have collapsed. This was another paper I wrote, actually with Kim Boddy and Jason [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7150.4800000000005s)]
*  Pollock. We wrote a couple of papers, one on Boltzmann brains, one on eternal inflation, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7154.8s)]
*  where we tried to be a little bit more respectable about the collapse of the wave function in [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7158.64s)]
*  cosmology. But I think that we haven't quite taken that lesson to heart more generally in terms of [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7162.8s)]
*  black holes and eternal inflation and things like that. People have sort of nodded at it. Tom Banks [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7169.280000000001s)]
*  has written some papers about things like this, but I think that taking the quantumness of the [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7175.76s)]
*  universe that we haven't yet observed seriously is something that we haven't done. Now, should we have [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7181.04s)]
*  done it? Does it matter? Maybe it doesn't matter. That's absolutely possible. So you have to actually [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7187.44s)]
*  get people interested in it by saying, okay, not only should you do this, but not only can you [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7193.679999999999s)]
*  take this aspect of physics more seriously, but here is why you will gain a benefit from doing that. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7199.28s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do right now. That's how science works. There'll be both hits [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7204.32s)]
*  and misses along the way. I guess that's the thing to keep in mind. Anyway, thanks very much for [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7208.32s)]
*  indulging me. This went way longer than it should have. I'm not surprised it went on this long, but [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7213.04s)]
*  it's longer than it needed to be. I'm sure that this was only of interest for the fraction of [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7219.04s)]
*  listeners who are really into the physics side of things, but hopefully you get an idea of the very [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7223.68s)]
*  different ways that some papers come together. Some are just single authors, some are with a group of [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7229.28s)]
*  people, some you have the idea and other people work it out, some vice versa. The list of authors [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7235.92s)]
*  changes and grows and shrinks as time goes on. You make mistakes, you have to revise them. It's [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7241.44s)]
*  all very messy and human and wonderful. And I love it. Doing science is just a great thing. And so [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7245.44s)]
*  looking forward to more hits and misses. Thanks again, everyone, for listening to the Mindscape [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7251.759999999999s)]
*  podcast and for your support. Have a great end of the year. See you in 2025. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ImJMmiXrg&t=7255.76s)]
