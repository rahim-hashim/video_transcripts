This is the monthly Ask Me Anything episode for the Mindscape podcast. It is offered courtesy of Patreon supporters of the podcast, who are invited to ask questions every month.

This is the first public release of these AMAs, and I'm still working out kinks. Ideally there would be a way to list the questions with timestamps, or even a full transcript. Stay tuned!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything | March 2020
**Mindscape Podcast:** [March 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0deVsq__g)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the March edition of Ask Me Anything for the Mindscape Podcast.
*  I'm your host, John Carroll.
*  And this, as you probably know, is the first version of the AMAs where the answers this
*  episode that we're listening to right now is going to be released publicly.
*  We haven't exactly figured out the best way to get it to the public.
*  So for right now, it's just going to be the usual thing where I put it on the Patreon
*  page and I'm just going to let it be accessible to the public.
*  Most people won't know it because they don't visit the Patreon page, but I will let people
*  know by Twitter or whatever.
*  When we eventually get a different system running, if that ever happens, the Patreon
*  supporters method is not going to change in any way.
*  You'll still get the episodes more or less as soon as they're recorded, more or less
*  right here on the Patreon page.
*  No ads or anything like that.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  Just so you know that whatever questions you ask, the answers I give will be sent out there
*  to the world for everyone to listen to.
*  Apologies that this is coming out a little bit later than usual.
*  This is Sunday, March 8th when I'm recording this and releasing it.
*  Of course, I was in Australia, did a very fun tour through Australia and New Zealand,
*  sponsored by an organization called Think Inc., which is a wonderful little tiny
*  organization that sends speakers dealing with fun intellectual topics around
*  Australia and New Zealand.
*  They're hoping to expand their purview to LA and California and elsewhere.
*  So maybe you'll see them if you're in one of those areas soon.
*  It was interesting when I flew into Australia, of course, people are careful now because
*  we're fighting a virus possible pandemic, the coronavirus and its associated infection,
*  COVID-19 and the disease whose name I forget.
*  The nomenclature is all complicated, but we all know what we mean.
*  When you fly into New Zealand or Australia, they take this very seriously.
*  There are questionnaires saying, have you been to mainland China in the last 14 days?
*  Are you coughing? Do you have any symptoms of serious illness?
*  When you fly back to the United States, you just welcome back.
*  There's really nothing at all that happens.
*  Usually I'm not in favor of panicking or overreacting to things like this.
*  But for those of us here in the US, I think that this is a situation where a little bit
*  of reaction is absolutely called for.
*  In some sense, it's a disease that has a low fatality rate, but it's a new disease
*  we have no vaccine or cure for.
*  And even a low fatality rate, if many, many people get it, is a terrible thing.
*  You know, I've read credible estimates that the number of people in the world that will
*  be infected by the virus is between 40 percent and 70 percent of the total world's
*  population. So in a very real sense, you will probably be in
*  infected by this virus.
*  Now, you can get infected and not get sick and you can get sick and not die, especially
*  if you're not already fighting with respiratory problems or elderly or frail or
*  whatever. But still, this is something that I think makes perfect sense to worry about.
*  I've already had several events that I was supposed to participate in be canceled.
*  Many of you might know the March American Physical Society meeting was canceled
*  literally the day before people were hopping on their planes.
*  And I think I get it. I'm in favor of that.
*  I think that if you can avoid unnecessary air travel, if you can avoid being in large
*  groups of people, especially people, groups that are coming from all over the world in
*  various different places, I certainly don't trust our current governmental setup here
*  in the United States to do the right thing.
*  They seem to be much more interested in keeping the reported numbers down than keeping
*  the actual amount of infection low and dealing with it.
*  They're not testing nearly as much as we could.
*  So it makes sense to take some precautions by yourself, which, of course, includes more
*  than anything else, washing your hands, right?
*  Washing your hands and not going into danger zones are the two most obvious things that
*  you can sensibly do. But, you know, you don't need to completely cancel your life.
*  You don't need to bunker down. I think that even domestic air travel for non-huge
*  conference reasons is probably perfectly legitimate.
*  Although what do I know? I'm a physicist with a cat on his head in his Twitter bio, not
*  a professional virologist or epidemiologist.
*  With that, I think that we're ready to go.
*  Some good questions this month. So let's go.
*  First question is from Valkia, who says, in your talk at UBC from December, you mentioned
*  that in the universe with emergent time and a finite dimensional Hilbert space, the number
*  of possible states is finite and so the universe must have a beginning and an end.
*  Isn't it also possible that such a universe there in such a universe, there could be a
*  closed loop of quantum states of some sort?
*  Yeah, I think that's completely possible.
*  I'm not even sure what the difference is, to be perfectly honest.
*  There in in one of these universes, what we're imagining here is that quantum mechanics
*  is living in a finite dimensional space of possibilities.
*  So as I will say, I think later on in the in the AMA, there's always an infinite number
*  of quantum states in any Hilbert space, but the number of distinct quantum states, the
*  number of quantum states with no overlap with each other is a finite number in a finite
*  dimensional Hilbert space.
*  And the idea of emergent time in these models is that time is a label on the quantum states
*  with that is told by a clock that lives within the quantum states.
*  So really, when you have these emergent time models with a finite dimensional Hilbert space,
*  there's only a finite number of possible ticks of the clock because there are a finite
*  number of distinct quantum states for the clock to have.
*  But time is emergent in these models.
*  So whether or not you think of the evolution as starting somewhere and ending somewhere
*  versus going in a loop is kind of hard to distinguish what you mean.
*  Right. I mean, I think you can think of it in either way, because time is not fundamental.
*  Time is a way of thinking about interpreting these labels on the quantum states.
*  Dmitry Shevchenko says, Do you think logical absolutes, the laws of logic, law of
*  excluded middle, stuff like that, are emergent rather than intrinsic to the universe?
*  Could they be emergent from the wave function of the universe and the Schrodinger equation?
*  This is one of those subtle questions.
*  I don't have a strong feeling about this, Dmitry.
*  This is a question that relates to issues of mathematical Platonism in my mind.
*  So Platonism is the idea that mathematical structures are real in some sense.
*  My inclination is to not go that way, to not think of mathematical constructs as real,
*  to think of the physical world as real, whatever your attitude about this is.
*  But I don't feel strongly about it, which is why I'm sort of speaking hesitatingly.
*  Like, I've heard good arguments on either way and I don't have a settled opinion of my own.
*  Whatever it is, whatever the reality level of a mathematical structure is, or a law of logic,
*  it's a different kind of reality than tables and chairs or electrons or something like that.
*  But I also don't think that they're emergent laws of mathematics and laws of logic.
*  I think that they're descriptions, you know, they're descriptions that you that you can't avoid.
*  I think that's the difference that I would want to emphasize here.
*  The laws of physics being emergent, well, the higher level laws of physics that are emergent,
*  like fluid mechanics or fluids, for example, are contingent in the sense that in a different
*  universe, you would have had different laws of physics.
*  I don't think that the laws of logic or mathematics would be different in a different universe.
*  They might not describe the universe, but I think that's a different thing.
*  The laws of logic are the laws of logic.
*  They follow from axioms to conclusions and from different axioms, you get to different conclusions.
*  That's what math and logic do.
*  What science does, trying to figure out which patterns actually describe our real contingent
*  universe is a different thing.
*  So they're not emergent in the same way, just like they might not be real in the same way.
*  Krabby Smales says, on the last AMA you state the broken egg.
*  I've edited this a little bit just for length, but I think I got the essence correct.
*  On the last AMA you state the broken egg on the sidewalk is a record of a prior event,
*  but only if we assume a low entropy boundary condition.
*  Have you considered that a low entropy boundary condition may be part of what causal explanation is?
*  What I mean is that causal explanation always consists in finding a compact parsimonious
*  description in terms of a combination of dynamic laws and boundary conditions.
*  The most compact description of any present macro state includes a low entropy boundary
*  condition, which thus becomes the past.
*  This is because lower entropy macro states are also of lower algorithmic information content.
*  If we derive a thermodynamic arrow in this way from parsimony, then we cannot also ask for an
*  explanation of the low entropy early universe.
*  Indeed, how could we justify any such theoretical explanation except by appeal to its parsimony?
*  So I don't exactly agree with that.
*  I think that there's some correct things going on here, but I think that I think about it a little bit differently.
*  So parenthetically, one thing to get clear, you say because lower entropy macro states are of also
*  lower algorithmic information content, that's certainly not true.
*  As a general rule, the lowest algorithmic information content is in the highest entropy macro state.
*  The highest entropy macro state is thermal equilibrium.
*  It has essentially zero algorithmic information content.
*  You just say, boom, thermal equilibrium.
*  But likewise, some very, very low entropy macro states also have low algorithmic information content.
*  You say, you know, all the gas is on one side of the box or something like that.
*  There is no simple monotonic relationship between entropy and algorithmic information content.
*  So that's one parenthetical remark.
*  But the other one is you say the most compact description of any present macro state includes a low
*  entropy boundary condition, which thus becomes the past.
*  And I don't really agree with that one either.
*  If you have a compact, if you have a description of the present macro state, its most compact
*  description is just a statement of that present macro state.
*  If I say the gas is on one side of a box, that's it.
*  That's the most compact description of that present macro state.
*  It may be true that the gas came from one tiny slice of the volume in the box at an earlier time,
*  or it might be true that the gas used to be spread throughout the box and just through a random
*  fluctuation, it moved all onto one side.
*  Either one of those pasts is completely compatible with the present macro state.
*  The gas is on one half of the box.
*  So you're adding extra stuff when you add a low entropy boundary condition to that description of
*  the macro state.
*  So that's a feature of macro states.
*  So that's if you have a good macro coarse graining, you describe current macro states purely in terms
*  of their present configuration.
*  So adding a low entropy boundary condition is an extra piece of information, like it or not.
*  In fact, it's an incredibly powerful extra piece of information since in the space of all macro states,
*  in the space of all micro states corresponding to a certain present macro state, the overwhelming
*  majority of them will have come from a higher entropy past and go to a higher entropy future.
*  So I really think that adding in the extra low entropy initial condition is not only extra, but it's a
*  hugely leveraged extra bit of information.
*  It's a tiny word, right?
*  So it has low algorithmic information content.
*  I agree with that.
*  But it's far from necessary just to deal with the present macro state.
*  And it gives us an enormous amount of handle on what happened in the past.
*  But it's extra.
*  So I think that's why you sort of have to include it as an extra assumption, because without that
*  assumption, you wouldn't be able to say the things we want to say about reconstructing things in the
*  past from the present moment.
*  John Hamill says, There are various conditions like certain brain injuries that prevent people from
*  independently developing complex plans which project themselves into the future.
*  People suffering from such conditions may be otherwise lucid and healthy.
*  Why would it be wrong for me to push such people onto the truck going to the slaughterhouse to be
*  killed in the same way as the cattle?
*  So I think this is a very reasonable question to ask.
*  Let me parenthetically once again editorialize a little bit.
*  I know from having mentioned issues involving vegetarianism and eating meat and so forth in the
*  past, these are highly emotionally charged issues.
*  And I get that.
*  That's OK. Right.
*  It's not like a mistake to be emotionally invested in this.
*  It's kind of a big deal.
*  But my goal in this podcast and elsewhere in my life is to have as rational a conversation about
*  these issues as we can, even when the issues are highly emotionally charged.
*  These issues are hard.
*  It's hard because moral philosophy is hard.
*  So we I think we have to respect the hardness of it all and not immediately go to the most
*  emotionally charged language that we can find.
*  Now, it's perfectly OK to say, you know, I'm not in it for the rational discourse.
*  I think I know what the rational answer is.
*  I'm in it to change hearts and minds, right?
*  To to reach people at a visceral level, to be an activist, not an intellectual.
*  And then by all means, you know, then the emotionally resonant language makes perfect sense.
*  But when you talk about putting people onto trucks going to slaughterhouses, you're not trying
*  to have the most rational discussion you can.
*  You're trying to make an emotional appeal.
*  So I don't necessarily accuse John you of this doing this right now.
*  I'm letting you know that this is how it appears to other people.
*  And, you know, again, if you just want to be an activist and convince people, that's fine.
*  But let's I would be more in favor of trying to be as clear eyed about it as you can.
*  My mind about these issues is not at all made up.
*  I'm very open to listening to different people's opinions and ideas about this, which is why
*  I mentioned these things in my podcast conversations.
*  Having said all that, I think that, you know, this is there's very often whenever anyone
*  sort of tries to draw a line between here is what we can eat and here is what we can't
*  eat, no matter where you draw the line, people will argue over where the line should be drawn.
*  And that's a completely appropriate thing to do.
*  In the case of those of us who think it's perfectly OK to eat meat, to eat animals,
*  there's often you try to explain why you treat animals differently than you treat human
*  beings. And there's a move that is made that says, well, but some human beings are not
*  going to fit into your line drawing as human beings.
*  They're going to be on the other side because they have brain injuries or disabilities of
*  some sort or another. I don't find these arguments in particular persuasive at all,
*  because I have no trouble whatsoever drawing the line at the species level rather than the
*  individual level. If someone is a person, if someone is a human being, then I can treat them
*  according to certain rules, whether or not they have the mental capacities of the typical
*  human being. So I think that I have no trouble whatsoever just as a simple answer to this
*  question saying, yes, it is wrong to push such people onto the truck going to the slaughterhouse.
*  So that's the answer to the question. But of course, it brings up a lot of very, very
*  interesting issues. You know, when I was just in Australia, we was right at the time when the
*  next person coming to Australia to do a tour with Think Inc. is Peter Singer, the very famous
*  philosopher. On the one hand, he is sort of the intellectual leader of the animal rights movement.
*  Right? He thinks that animals, he's a vegetarian, he thinks animals should not be killed, etc.
*  But he's also, as a philosopher, tried to draw these lines very carefully rather than just be
*  emotional about it. And he's gotten in trouble because he is, you know, one of the things that
*  philosophers sometimes do is they have a set of moral intuitions and they try to build them up
*  into a system. And then they say, well, I should believe what the system tells me. And sometimes
*  when the system tells you something counterintuitive, you should say, well, maybe my system building
*  wasn't very good. But other times you might want to say I should believe in the system. So Singer is
*  very good at believing in his own system. And sometimes it leads him to say things about the
*  rights of disabled infants or mentally injured people that are not compatible with most people's
*  moral intuitions. It's subtle, and I'm not going to be able to correctly state exactly what his
*  position is. But let's just say it in that way. So people protested that he was going to come and
*  actually the venue in Auckland where he was supposed to speak cancelled his engagement.
*  They found another venue. I think it's a very bad idea to cancel an engagement like that. Like,
*  whatever you might think about Peter Singer and his ideas, you know, he's a super smart,
*  intellectual, rational, world leading philosopher. He's not some activist for anything,
*  anything inhuman or ugly or anything like that. He's exactly the kind of person who, if you disagree
*  with, which is fine, you should be trying to persuade with reason and logic, not by cancelling
*  his speech. But anyway, that was sorry, that was a long digression. The point is, the fact that an
*  individual human being is not capable of projecting themselves into the future. I get that. I would
*  still want to protect their rights as a human being because they're a member of the species
*  that does have that capability. But also I think that most people, I'm not up on all the different
*  levels of mental injuries that you can have here, brain injuries and so forth. But most people,
*  even with the injuries that I'm aware of, are able to understand that they are being put on a truck
*  going to a slaughterhouse, right? In a way that a cow is not. Of course, maybe you can argue that
*  the cows are, they complain, etc. You know, they probably, cows are able to have a little bit of
*  anticipation of what's happening next. And I think that's a perfectly good argument to have whether
*  or not that is enough to put them in a different category. Okay, Rohit says, what do you think
*  about the late Freeman Dyson's belief that there are more pressing matters than climate change,
*  which may not statistically be that big a deal? Statically, you've written here,
*  I'm not sure what that means. But anyway, yeah, I think the late Freeman Dyson was completely wrong
*  about climate change in many ways. Of course, the argument that there are more pressing matters
*  may or may not be true. You know, I'm a believer, as I talked about in the podcast with Martin Reiss,
*  that nuclear proliferation is a huge deal for us here on Earth. I have no real way of judging
*  whether it's a more pressing matter than climate change. But I also have great belief in humanity's
*  capability to handle more than one thing at once. In fact, I think it's kind of necessary. So the
*  fact that there's a more pressing matter is completely irrelevant to me. You know, I think
*  that climate change is a hugely pressing matter and we should deal with it. So I think the Freeman
*  Dyson was just wrong about that. Brad Wells says, would you please comment on the state of
*  supersymmetry and by extension string theory given the null results coming out of the large
*  Hadron Collider to date? My understanding is that most supersymmetry variants have strong
*  correlation between the mass of at least some supersymmetric particles and the mass of the
*  Higgs. Is this a deafening silence or just a work in progress? This is a great question. I think it's
*  a very complicated answers, a complicated set of issues to do justice to. So on the one hand,
*  it's very important to say that both string theory and supersymmetry don't automatically predict
*  anything at the large Hadron Collider. This is part of the problem with these models is that they're
*  frameworks and there's many, many specific ways to have models within them. And so it would have
*  been great if we had found supersymmetric particles at the LHC. It would have had almost
*  nothing to say about string theory. I mean, supersymmetry and string theory are different
*  things. String theory predicts supersymmetry, but supersymmetry doesn't predict string theory. So
*  it would have given as a Bayesian a tiny little boost to string theory if we had found supersymmetry
*  at the LHC, but it's only a tiny little boost because you can absolutely have supersymmetry
*  without string theory. Now, whether or not you should have expected supersymmetry at the LHC,
*  I think I did write a blog post where I made my prediction ahead of time, but it's something like
*  50% that I personally predicted that you'd be able to find supersymmetry at the LHC. So I don't think
*  it was very, very strong. There was a whole set of arguments, which I think were reasonable,
*  that said, look, we have the Higgs boson. It's clearly at a mass scale much lower than what you
*  would expect if you didn't know anything else. We have an explanation for how to explain that
*  low mass scale, namely supersymmetry cancelling out certain radiative corrections, certain quantum
*  corrections to the mass of the Higgs. If that explanation is the right one, then you should
*  find supersymmetric particles at the LHC. But of course, the reason why the Higgs boson has a low
*  mass might have nothing to do with that particular supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem,
*  as it's called, even if supersymmetry is still right. So if you didn't know about the Higgs boson
*  and the hierarchy problem, if you were just doing supersymmetry, you wouldn't automatically say that
*  the supersymmetric particles should be at the electric weak scale where we could find them at
*  the Large Hadron Collider, which by the way, we might still, you know, it might be the word,
*  they're just around the corner. We haven't found them, but it's absolutely true that we could easily
*  in the space of all possible models, found them a long time ago. So I do personally think that the
*  fact that we found, so what I personally think is the fact that we found nothing other than the
*  Higgs boson so far is telling us an awful lot. Forget about supersymmetry. Supersymmetry is a
*  good idea, but it may or may not be true. But regardless of supersymmetry, it's still true
*  that in our usual way of thinking, there is this weird unlikeliness that the Higgs boson would have
*  the low mass that it does. That problem still arises. And not only supersymmetry, but sort of
*  almost any easy straightforward answer to that question predicts extra particles at the energies
*  that are visible at the Large Hadron Collider, and we haven't found any of them. So that is
*  absolutely saying something. Not only have we not found that, but we haven't found the
*  dark matter particles that would have been an easy fit into supersymmetry or other weak scale
*  theories. We still have the cosmological constant problem, etc. So I am very open to the idea that
*  all of these little clues are telling us that there's something utterly wrong about our way
*  of predicting what the masses of these particles should be, our way of distinguishing what is
*  natural and what is not natural. Now, I know that some people say, well, we just shouldn't have made
*  those predictions at all. We have no idea what's natural. I don't buy that either. I think that,
*  you know, physicists try to do the best they can. And until we have a better idea, we should
*  go with what we have. So we have arguments that say that the low mass of the Higgs is not natural,
*  and therefore we should try to explain it. Now, you can say those arguments are wrong,
*  but I only am persuaded by you saying that if you have another reason to explain why the Higgs boson
*  has the mass that it does. And those reasons are very hard to come by. I've tried it myself. I've
*  made zero progress. You know, I've had some ideas, none of them panned out. So I hope that other
*  people are taking seriously. And I think it's true that other people are taking seriously the idea
*  that the deafening silence at the LHC is a kind of a clue that a different approach is needed.
*  That's easy to say. The hard part, of course, is to figure out what the different approach should be.
*  There's an infinite number of potential different approaches one could take.
*  Zachary Stopa says, Why do scientists when debating each other, when one person stops
*  speaking the other before the retort always begins with the word good? Do you guys know this is a
*  thing? So I think it's a thing. Yeah, I think that we do know I'm not sure if everyone does it. I know
*  I do it. And I think, to be honest, I picked it up from David Albert, who was a philosopher,
*  not that he's trained as a physicist, but he's a philosopher. Now, you probably have heard our
*  podcast episode together, and David very famously and very obviously says good in that sort of way
*  all the time. I think it's a good thing. I get why it's done. What you're doing is you're saying,
*  we're having a logical, rational conversation. We're trying to first come to some agreement
*  on things and then move forward. The word good signifies, okay, we've understood something now
*  mutually, let's move on to the next thing. So I mean, maybe it's a verbal tick, but I think that
*  there's much worse verbal ticks out there. Peter Galei says, Can you please comment on the recent
*  discrepancies in determining the Hubble constant due to different methods of measuring the expansion
*  rate of the universe? I don't have much comment on it. I am moving forward on the assumption that
*  will go away. I don't know that it will go away. I hope it doesn't go away. I hope that it's a huge
*  deal and teaches us something really profound about the universe that we don't currently
*  understand. But it's one of those cases where again, as a good Bayesian, there's no easy
*  explanation for I should I should explain for those of you who are not following this discrepancy,
*  there's something called the Hubble tension crisis. You can measure the Hubble constant,
*  the rate of expansion of the universe directly by looking at galaxies and supernovae nearby and
*  seeing how far they are away and how fast they're moving away from us. There's also kind of indirect
*  way using the cosmic microwave background and the evolution of the asymmetries and temperature
*  and so forth. These ways should give the same answer and they give slightly discrepant answers.
*  Exactly how big the discrepancy is, is you know, a matter of debate, but it seems to be big enough
*  that people are worried that these two methods are giving different answers. Again, I think it'll
*  just go away because all these methods are really, really hard and it's easy to underestimate your
*  systematic errors. And also because there's no obvious explanation for why that would be true.
*  In 1998 when we found that the universe was accelerating rather than decelerating,
*  a huge part of why that really remarkable and surprising result was so easy to accept was
*  because we instantly had a theory that predicted it, right? The cosmological constant.
*  And that's just, I think that's correctly taken in a Bayesian framework to be a good reason to give
*  a certain experimental result extra credence. So I know that people are taking this result very
*  seriously. You know, as a researcher, you have to choose which results to take seriously and
*  which not. You know, my mode these days is to not be an ambulance chaser trying to explain the most
*  recent tension in one or the other experimental results. My mode recently used to say, you know,
*  I'd rather take a step back. We have standard models in particle physics and cosmology and gravity.
*  They're very, very good at fitting the data. They're not very good at fitting together. So I
*  want to be more interested in the foundations of these subjects and figure out how to fit them
*  together than try to figure out whether or not the most recent experimental result is actually
*  telling us something. Frank Cochritz says, with regard to your and Max Tegmark's assigned
*  probability of 50% to eternal inflation theory and its outcome of a multiverse, could you express
*  your thoughts on just one possible alternative that would address the fine tuning of constants
*  of the universe in which we reside? So there's different kinds of things that people mean when
*  you say fine tuning. Sometimes you just mean the numbers are very different than what you might
*  naively expect. Like we already talked about with the Higgs boson mass or the vacuum energy.
*  Sometimes you mean the fine tuning that allows for the existence of life in the universe. So in
*  either case, you know, the most obvious alternative explanation is we got lucky. That's it. There is no
*  explanation. This is just how the world is. We happen to live in a universe that allows for life
*  to exist. There you go. You know, all of these arguments about naturalness and so forth are not
*  ever airtight, right? When you say that the values of the constants of nature are fine tuned,
*  that's not the same as saying that there is some disagreement between theory and experiment.
*  That's just saying that if we randomly picked the constants of nature, given some measure on the
*  space of all possible constants of nature, we would be surprised at these particular values.
*  Who knows what that measure should be? And I don't think anyone thinks that we do randomly pick the
*  constants of nature. So if it is what it is, that's an absolutely perfectly okay explanation for these
*  things. The other thing, which I am always a big advocate of is understanding that we don't know
*  the conditions under which life can arise. If someone handed you the laws of physics and didn't,
*  and you didn't know about the periodic table and the nuclei and chemistry in life and whatever,
*  you wouldn't be able to look at the standard model or the core theory laws of nature and say,
*  oh yes, that allows for life. But if I change this parameter, it wouldn't, right? We are lucky enough
*  to ex post facto know that the laws of physics that we actually have around us allow for life.
*  But knowing whether or not other laws of physics would allow for life is an incredibly hard problem.
*  So I am not at all confident that we can even say that the laws of physics are fine tuned for life
*  to exist. Anders says, imagine a cat in free fall with his back toward the ground. The cat will
*  rotate itself to land on all fours. How does the cat do this without violating conservation of
*  angular momentum? I read the official explanation, but I don't really understand it. So I'm sorry,
*  Anders, this is just not the kind of physics I'm very good at. I'm self-aware enough to know that.
*  There's a whole book by Greg Gabor about this and other sort of feline physics problems if you're
*  really interested in it. But even though I'm not going to be able to give you the complete answer,
*  I will tell you the trick to understanding the answer, which is there's a difference between
*  the idealizations that physicists use when understanding and talking about the universe
*  and the real messy way the universe works. So sure, angular momentum is conserved for an isolated
*  system. Cats falling down are not isolated systems. You know, they have different moments of inertia
*  that interact in different ways with the air around them. It's never exactly true that they
*  have zero angular momentum when you drop them. There's a lot of messy realities that come in
*  between you and the simplified spherical cow explanation that we physicists will often give.
*  So you should never be very surprised that the real world is a little bit more intricate
*  and complicated than the world of physics explanations. Jake Johansson says, can you
*  give me one of your classic style explanations on how we know that hidden variable theory is wrong?
*  I'm not entirely sure that I fully grasp what I've read about it so far. So we don't know
*  that hidden variable theory is wrong. Hidden variable theories could be right, also known as
*  pilot wave theories or Bohmian mechanics or de Broglie-Bohm theory. These are versions of
*  quantum mechanics that say that in addition to the wave function, there are extra variables that also
*  tell us what we're going to observe once we actually do make a quantum observation.
*  So the rough motto here is that the reason why, let's say in a double slit experiment,
*  electrons sometimes appear particle-like and sometimes wave-like is because they are both.
*  There really is a wave, the wave function, and there really is a particle, the electron.
*  So that could be right. I don't know. I doubt it very much because, number one,
*  most importantly, I just completely have no need for that. I think that the wave function alone
*  provides exactly the same explanatory power, namely in the many-worlds interpretation.
*  So why in the world would I add extra variables on top of it? In these hidden variable theories,
*  you still have a wave function. The wave function still obeys the Schrodinger equation.
*  The wave function still represents part of reality. Then you add extra stuff on top of it
*  to pick out one of the worlds that an Everettian would say that we live in.
*  And I just don't see the need to actually do that. It is weird. Many hidden variable theories is a
*  weird theory because the wave function pushes around the particles, but the particles do not
*  push around the wave function. If they did, it'd be experimentally rule-outable very, very quickly.
*  And there's another reason why modern physicists don't give it a lot of credence, namely that
*  it was developed, the hidden variable theories, in the context of non-relativistic quantum
*  mechanics, where you have a particle with a position, etc. Of course, these days,
*  we use quantum field theory to describe the world. And if you care about gravity, there are those of
*  us, including myself, who think that even quantum field theory is not up to the task, and you have
*  to look beyond that. And you need—so let's put it the charitable way. In these hidden variable
*  theories, whenever you say, oh, it's not particles, it's fields, oh, it's not fields,
*  it's something else, you have to start from scratch and figure out what the hidden variables
*  are going to be. I personally think that's going to be a really, really hard thing to do
*  for quantum gravity, etc. Maybe impossible. Even for quantum field theory, people have done it,
*  people have made progress in that direction, but it doesn't look pretty. It doesn't naturally fall
*  together. Whereas many worlds in these different versions of the theory are just plug and play.
*  You just have a Hamiltonian that makes the wave function move, and then your job is to interpret
*  it correctly, and that's the job we're trying to do. James Kittick says, I'm curious about the
*  tools you use as a theoretical physicist, as well as your personal preferences. When doing theoretical
*  work, how much of your time is spent in front of a piece of paper versus a whiteboard chalkboard
*  versus a computer? Do you geek out on writing instruments like specific brands of pencils or
*  fountain pens or whatever? I'm not a big geek about those things. I get it. Some of my best
*  friends care a lot about their writing implements and their chalk and so forth. When I actually do
*  physics, 98% of it is me writing in one form or the other, not working at a computer. Coding
*  or doing numerical simulations is a tiny, tiny part, not zero, but a tiny part of my own working
*  life. It has traditionally been pen. I don't really use pencils ever. My favorite pen,
*  I do have a favorite kind of pen, but it's not like a fancy one. It's a cheapo Uniball Vision Elite.
*  I love these pens and I try to get them whenever I can, so I have a big supply of them, but okay,
*  I'm very happy to use whatever pen is around. I've been experimenting, as I think I've said,
*  with using an iPad and an Apple Pencil. It's very, very good. There's a number of huge benefits
*  of writing with the iPad and the Apple Pencil. Namely, you can cut and paste. You can annotate
*  PDFs. You can sign documents and things like that. There's also a pretty big downside, which is that
*  the access time is just slow. If I have a 10-page long calculation and I'm writing on page 10 and I
*  need a result that was on page two, on paper it's trivial. You just look at it and the iPad you ought
*  to scroll down and try to find it and scroll back up and remember. It's still not anywhere close to
*  the convenience level of a pen and paper for looking at previous pages or stuff like that.
*  I do sometimes, very often, use a chalkboard or a whiteboard. I don't really care. I'm not
*  fanatic about that. Certainly when I'm talking to students or collaborators,
*  we're standing in front of chalkboards or whiteboards all the time. Alexander Khabanov says,
*  is the collective unconscious real in any useful sense of the word? The collective unconscious,
*  again, I'm not an expert on this, but it's a concept from Jungian psychology. I presume,
*  since I'm not an expert, I'm just going to speak in vague generalities here. There's different ways
*  to think about it. There's the idea that there is collective memory that is literally carried on by
*  oral traditions and written traditions and handed down in different cultures, share stories and
*  mores and folkways and traditions versus something a little bit more spooky where there's sort of some
*  non-verbal, non-literary transmission of information from minds of different generations
*  to the others. My impression is that the Jungians are, or Jung himself, was pretty spooky about this
*  stuff and to that extent I think that it's not real at all. But there might be a more sort of
*  metaphorical allegorical sense in which the traditions that we hand down function as a
*  collective unconscious in some way. I don't have a strong feeling about that. Thomas Prunty says,
*  if I recall correctly in classical electromagnetics, you arbitrarily select an arrow of time by picking
*  retarded potentials over advanced potentials. Is the situation different in quantum electrodynamics?
*  How does that fit in with the entropy-driven arrow of time? It's not different in quantum
*  electrodynamics at all. It's the same story. In my mind, it's exactly the same as the entropy-driven
*  arrow of time. The fact that there are no electromagnetic waves that are focusing in on
*  an oscillating electron. So, sorry, I mean, I should back up. For those of you who are not familiar
*  with this story, if I shake an electron, spherical waves of electromagnetic radiation move away from
*  that shaking electron. Light, that's where all the light comes from that is in your room right now.
*  If the actual configuration of stuff in the universe was completely symmetric toward past
*  and future, that means that when you shake an electron there should be a set of spherically
*  symmetric waves focusing in on it. But there are not. That's a difference between the past
*  and the future. And I think that's because of a low entropy boundary condition in the early universe.
*  Because if it weren't for such a boundary condition, we'd be in thermal equilibrium.
*  We'd be in electromagnetic equilibrium. There'd be exactly the same number of electromagnetic waves
*  hitting the electron as leaving it. So to me, it's the same story. Not everyone agrees,
*  but I think those people are wrong. Clyde Schechter says, on a few occasions you've said that if space
*  is closed, then it is either a sphere or a torus. Are these the only possibilities or just examples?
*  These are just examples. I'm sorry if I ever gave the misimpression that way. I will often say if
*  space is closed like a sphere or a torus because those are the closed manifolds that people are
*  very well aware of. It is absolutely possible that space, that is the space of the whole universe
*  we're talking about now, is closed but is neither a sphere nor a torus. It's something more
*  topologically complicated. There was a lot of excitement in the 1990s. There's a lot of
*  interest experimentally in asking could the universe be negatively curved and have a complicated
*  finite topology and could we actually observe that in the cosmic microwave background?
*  I mean roughly speaking the answer is we've tried now. We've collected the data and it's not there.
*  We see no evidence observationally for that topology, but it could just be larger than
*  the observable universe. That's completely a possibility. Philip Meiman says, my question is
*  about zero amplitudes and near zero amplitudes. Presumably this is the amplitude of a quantum
*  mechanical wave function, a specific possibility within it. Do zero amplitude events still happen
*  but with width zero or do they not happen in a fundamentally different way from simply happening
*  with smaller and smaller width? Yeah I think they don't happen. There's no such thing as happening
*  with zero width. That's a difference. I think there's a fundamentally different thing. There
*  are things in the wave function for which there can be zero amplitude and you say that those things
*  don't happen. Now you might argue that in the real world if there's a continuous possibility
*  of amplitudes the chances that you will get exactly zero are very small, but there's sort
*  of counter arguments to that. My favorite example is always there's zero amplitude for a quantum
*  transition between two different states with different electric charge. We say the technical
*  term there is that there are super selection sectors for electrical charge, but if you want
*  to say like if you have a spin that is a spin up and spin down can you truly really absolutely
*  get it into a situation where the amplitude for observing spin down is exactly zero? That might
*  be harder to do, but conditionally, counterfactually, if you did then yes it would just not happen. It
*  doesn't happen with with with with zero. Brendan Hall says do you believe in the circularity of
*  language and definitions, sorry do you believe that the circularity of language and definitions
*  is a true problem for philosophy? I'm reminded of your conversation with Philip Goff where he
*  seemed to invoke the problem of circular definitions to justify intrinsic natures.
*  Do you feel a similar urge to solve a problem of definitions like Philip does? I think if I
*  understood that discussion that we had correctly that Philip is worried about the fact that you
*  know you had things like mass and force and physics, but you can't define perfectly well
*  any one of those concepts without also defining the others right and you define them in terms of
*  each other. I do not think that's a problem at all you know I think that as I think I said in that
*  conversation what I think you do is you have a mathematical formalism that you call your theory
*  of physics and there are some axioms some definitions and things do absolutely you know
*  relate to each other within that formalism and then you say that that maps on to the world and
*  I am kind of a coherentist when it comes to truth so I think that it's important that your system
*  fit together that all your definitions be mutually sensible but that's not really a problem I don't
*  think that there's any grounding like I think that as I discuss in the big picture this is a
*  philosophical difference between different kinds of people. I'm someone who doesn't think that there
*  needs to be an absolutely firm foundation that you can't question and then you build everything
*  on top of that foundation. There is a bottom in my mind a bottom level set of laws of physics even
*  though we don't know what they are but our knowledge of the laws of physics is not foundational in
*  anything it's always contingent it's always like well this is the best we can do we're trying to
*  fit in everything we understand logically and mathematically with all the empirical data that
*  we have and I think that's fine I don't think it's really a problem at all in fact I think it's sort
*  of inevitable there's really no other way to do it. Santiago Torres says what does physics have to
*  say about how we should think about the concept of causation? Is it correct to say that we should
*  not apply the concept of cause beyond the limits of our experience to describe any fundamental
*  aspect of reality? Well I wouldn't say limits of our experience I think the concept of cause is
*  as some of you know from my previous discussions a higher level emergent phenomenon so when
*  you stub your toe and it hurts you are absolutely within your rights to say my toe hurts because I
*  stubbed it because I banged it against the table okay there's nothing wrong with that you're not
*  making a mistake when you do that but that kind of language which makes perfect sense in the
*  macroscopic world of our experience ceases making sense at the microscopic level or even the sort of
*  pristine level of Newtonian mechanics where you don't have entropy you don't have an arrow of time
*  you just have very simple systems obeying reversible deterministic laws of physics.
*  In those senses in those cases where you have deterministic reversible laws the usual notion
*  of cause and effect ceases to have its usual umph right it's not that anything goes it's that it's
*  replaced by a set of laws by a set of patterns usually differential equations so there's still
*  a way of describing the relationship between the situation of the world at one moment of time and
*  another moment of time but that description is not in terms of cause and effect it's term it's in
*  terms of the laws of physics. Gerard Dryven says okay sitting in a room atom clock on the floor and
*  one at the ceiling the one at the ceiling where there is less gravity ticks faster with my not
*  good developed physics mind I call it excitement for now is there a limit to this excitement the
*  presumably that's the fastness of the ticking the speed of oscillating of the atom from being in a
*  gravity field to a place where there is no gravity field so I think this is going to come up yeah
*  this is the very next question it's going to come up also let me ask the next question and answer
*  them both together the next question is from David Lang who says special relativity tells us the faster
*  we move in space the slower our clock runs in time and it's symmetrical the world's fastest man
*  Usain Bolt goes through the slowest time according to his cesium stopwatch I've edited this for length
*  a little bit his watch would show even less time than the official timekeeper because it was in
*  motion he set the record for greatest time dilation by a human on foot at 100 meters he has earned the
*  right to be called the world's slowest man through time so let me just say a few things that I think
*  are true about relativity and time that are relevant to both of these questions Gerards and
*  Davids I would really be reluctant to ever say that clocks tick faster or slower because if you
*  were there with the clock you would always see it ticking at one second per second what else could
*  you possibly see it ticking at because all of the clocks including your mental clocks and your
*  perception would be ticking would be affected by gravity or by your velocity in exactly the same
*  way so there is a rate at which clocks tick one second per second and to Gerard's question yes
*  there is something called zero gravitational field flat space we can come very very close to that
*  far away from any gravitating bodies and clocks would tick at one second per second the only thing
*  you can do is talk about the relative amount of total ticks that a clock feels and if you're really
*  precise about it if you really want to get it right you can only compare what the clocks are
*  doing when they are literally right next to each other at the same point in space when two clocks
*  are separated you need to send a signal back and forth to see what they're doing and different ways
*  of sending that signal will get you different answers so the really rigorous well-defined way
*  of doing this is to start clocks at the same part of space time send them on different trajectories
*  and then bring them back together like you do in the twin paradox this is exactly the condition
*  under which you will say the clock that was in a less gravitational field had more ticks to it than
*  one that you sent down onto the earth or near the black hole and came back okay but you're very
*  tempted to say therefore the clock that was in the gravitational field must have been ticking
*  more slowly i would advocate not saying that or you might want to say the clock that was carried
*  by usain bolt was ticking more slowly i would advocate not saying that usain bolt watch usain
*  bolt's cesium wristwatch was still ticking at one second per second it's only the comparison when
*  he's done running in which the whole journey was different okay so this is why i like to use this
*  analogy of walking like space rather than space time you can walk between two points on a straight
*  line and that will be the minimum distance you can possibly traverse you can also walk on a curved
*  path between those two points and if you carry an odometer with you your odometer will say you have
*  walked more steps more distance even though you went from the same point to the same point how is
*  it possible that you went more distance well i mean no one is surprised by that right the ticking
*  clocks are exactly the same way except that you always go through less time rather than more
*  distance so don't think of clocks ticking faster or slower think of taking a shortcut through time
*  if you either travel near the speed of light and go out and come back or you spend a lot of time in
*  a gravitational field you get to the future event faster experiencing fewer ticks of the clock then
*  you would if you had just stayed out there away from gravity moving at zero velocity cyclopropane
*  says i loved your interview with kwame anthony appia thank you i like that one too the more you
*  touch on our global identities versus our smaller pettier nationalistic identities the more i enjoyed
*  it at what point do you think nations governments cultures are able to shed their guilt for past
*  atrocities how can i live in the usa as a first generation citizen and not acknowledge that my
*  success here is based on the shoulders of slaves and the genocide of native americans
*  so i think that there's there's a little bit of a elision here between two different concepts you
*  say at what point can you shed guilt and and at what point do you acknowledge that your success
*  is based on past misdeeds i think these are two different things guilt and acknowledgement are
*  very different things i'm all in favor of acknowledging and i'm also in favor of shedding
*  guilt but those are two different processes you should never stop acknowledging like i don't think
*  it's any point at which you said okay sorry i did something wrong but therefore you stop saying that
*  you've done something wrong or admitting that you've done something wrong typically whether it's the
*  united states or germany or japan or anywhere else because most cultures have bad things in their
*  past uh typically the error is on the other side right a reluctance to admit that you've done
*  something wrong in the past it's not that you are over correcting for what you've done in the past
*  so i think it's it's good to to admit and acknowledge the truth of history that there
*  have been terrible things done in the past and some of us have benefited from those terrible things
*  that doesn't mean you should personally feel guilty i don't think that a person should feel guilty for
*  what their ancestors did i think they should acknowledge what their ancestors did and admit
*  the truth of it and understand that and i'm much more interested in trying to make the present
*  conditions fair and equitable than in feeling bad or feeling good you know i don't think you
*  should feel a special pride in what your ancestors did either you don't get either pride or guilt for
*  that you are not around right you should acknowledge the truth of what they've done and try to make the
*  present world as good and equitable and fair as you can kirk briggs said i like the philosophy of
*  schopenhauer a lot at the same time i recognize that he is a total pig when speaking about women
*  how do you reconcile it do i let his inappropriate attitudes influence my opinion of his philosophy
*  you know i think that uh you don't i wouldn't advocate letting the personal failings of people
*  influence your attitude about their creations about their works right to the extent that their
*  works are independent of their personal foibles because guess what everybody has personal foibles
*  okay this is why i'm not in favor of having heroes or or hero worshiping i think that people
*  do good things and you should give them credit for the good things they do without making them
*  your hero because there might be bad things that they've done or there might not but when we're
*  talking about public figures or historical figures we rarely know them personally right we
*  rarely know who they are we rarely know how they treat people who are on a lower level of status
*  and power than them maybe they're very sweet adorable people maybe they're not but you don't
*  know i don't know and so i'm not going to say that they're my hero or role model i will say that they
*  have done something good and i will admire that and you know in terms of accomplishments in
*  philosophy or science i think that there's all sorts of awful people who've done really wonderful
*  philosophy and science and we should give them credit for their good philosophy and science
*  it becomes a much harder question in my mind when it's art when it's literature or painting or music
*  rather than philosophy or science because the enjoyment that we have of those things is much
*  more subjective right you know isaac newton may have been a terrible person he was a terrible
*  person in many ways that has zero impact on the efficacy of newton's laws but you know if you
*  watched um uh nanette by henna gatsby and she makes a good case that picasso does not observe
*  does not deserve your admiration i think it's hard to argue that picasso's paintings were really good
*  but when we learn about what a terrible person he was does that color our enjoyment of the paintings
*  and i think yeah there's nothing wrong with that you know since our enjoyment of the paintings
*  is purely subjective of course non uh objective things like the identity and the nature of the
*  artist can affect your enjoyment of them i'm not saying that it necessarily should affect your
*  enjoyment of it because it's subjective you can make that choice for yourself but i think it's
*  completely legitimate to let it affect your enjoyment of them dan o'neill says what if it
*  were your job to go back in time sit down with isaac newton and explain general relativity to him
*  how difficult would it be and what do you imagine it would be like well i hope this
*  for isaac would not be upset that i just said he was a terrible person in many ways you know i
*  i'd like to think it wouldn't be that difficult i mean it would be difficult in the sense that
*  there's a lot that isaac newton doesn't know compared to what we know now i mean not just
*  general relativity but tensor calculus for that matter vector calculus right there's a lot of
*  things that we are teaching our physics students in their first year as undergraduates that isaac
*  newton never heard of so there's an enormous amount of background that you would have to teach isaac
*  but he was very smart so i think that you have an easier time teaching it to him i have zero idea of
*  how open-minded he was to these new ideas my guess is that he would catch up very very quickly
*  you know we are not intrinsically smarter than people from a few hundred years ago we just know
*  a lot more and i think that he would still be someone who qualifies as a physics genius even
*  if you went back and tried to teach him modern physics graham henry says can black holes be
*  viewed as objects that convert mass energy into spacetime curvature does this mean that mass energy
*  spacetime can be viewed as a single thing so i don't think that there's any such conversion
*  process going on you know we there's a weird way that we talk about black holes because black holes
*  are weird you know they're they're outside our everyday experience and as i've said many times
*  on this podcast the singularity of a black hole is not a point at the middle it is a moment of time
*  in the future later on we're going to get to the big bang which was a moment of time in the past
*  we visualize these things as points but they're really not they're really moments so we will often
*  say matter falls into a black hole and goes and hits the singularity and that's true but it's also
*  true that the matter is still there the matter is inside the black hole and it is moving toward the
*  future and in the future in some very short period of time typically it will hit the singularity but
*  while we're outside the black hole the matter is still inside the matter that went into making
*  that black hole so it didn't get converted into spacetime curvature there's a relationship an
*  interplay between matter and spacetime that led to a black hole robert rux andrescu says imagine
*  that laplace's demon exists and knows the position and momentum of every particle in the universe so
*  we're being newtonian for the moment would it be able to predict that i didn't like a particular
*  ice cream or that i was sad three days ago and how sad i was in other words would it be able to
*  grasp the quality of my qualia based on just easy problem properties so i think there's a little bit
*  of an undefined question but i think we can um put you know we can we can fix it up a little bit
*  the point is what do you mean by laplace's demon so laplace himself had this view of a vast intelligence
*  that knew the position velocity of every particle and could therefore predict the future in the past
*  of every particle but the question is does the process demon know anything else right so in some
*  sense there's a minimal version of laplace's demon where literally the only thing this vast
*  intelligence knows are the positions and velocities of particles it doesn't know that there are things
*  called words or chairs or planets it just knows a long list of particles and their positions like if
*  it were literally a computer with a data file right a computer with a data file can do a simulation
*  of a supernova blowing up but if you asked it in words you know how hot was the supernova would
*  have no idea you could write a sub program though right you could easily add to your program an
*  extra little routine that said calculate the temperature and it would be able to do that
*  so in the point of view of myself or anyone else who is a physicalist about consciousness
*  you could easily imagine a version of laplace's demon that did have access to these quality
*  questions to what we think of as our qualia is this is this collection of atoms a person is this
*  person sad or happy are they experiencing red etc for someone like me all of those supervene on
*  the physical locations of the particles and therefore are in principle calculable by laplace's
*  demon level intelligence from that information but you have to tell me whether or not you've actually
*  given the demon the calculational capacity and the right definitions to actually answer those
*  questions joshua levin says have you ever tried psychedelics if so do you think that they can have
*  any true value for helping you see things in new ways so i i mentioned this a little bit in my
*  recent podcast with robin carhartt harris the effects of psychedelics have i have tried them
*  once in my life i tried lsd the story is told in jennifer willett my wife's book called me myself
*  and why um you know i was not there for i was mostly there for moral support and to sort of
*  be the caregiver and you know um making sure everything went wrong so i was not sort of giving
*  myself over to the psychedelic experience in a complete way so i am in no way claiming that i
*  really have tried all different psychedelics and tried them in the appropriate ways and so forth
*  you know i am someone who believes that on the one hand psychedelics can be very very helpful
*  in helping people get out of addictions or ruts or depressions or things like that they can help
*  people with pain management they can help people face end of life crises kind of things i'm a big
*  believer in the therapeutic value of psychedelics your question is do they have any true value for
*  helping you see things in new ways well i don't know what exactly that means right like i did
*  just to amuse myself when i did the lsd trip i said you know does this help me with the physics
*  problems that i was working on at the time the physics research problems the answer to that was
*  certainly no like it was much harder to write down equations and solve them when you were on lsd than
*  when you were not probably not a surprise i think that it's very plausible to me that being on
*  psychedelics might lead you to some sort of creative breakthrough by seeing things in a
*  different way i don't think it gives you any deep insight that is over and above what you in principle
*  could get without them right it might help ease you get there but everything that is in principle
*  figureoutable on psychedelics i would argue is in principle figureoutable without them
*  stephen berniger says how does general relativity impact the electromagnetic force more specifically
*  how are electromagnetic waves atoms molecules crystals and ultimately macroscopic objects
*  held together by electromagnetic forces reacting to vibrating spacetime so i don't think i don't i
*  wouldn't use the phrase vibrating spacetime i would use i would say curved spacetime you know if an
*  object like the earth is more or less static then the spacetime around it is more or less static
*  but it is curved by the earth having its energy and momentum just sitting there i think that the
*  short answer to your question is the whole point of general relativity is that gravity is universal
*  that gravity couples to and interacts with everything in exactly the same way this was
*  what led einstein to the great insight that we should treat gravity not as a force moving
*  through spacetime but as a feature of spacetime itself as the curvature of spacetime so to the
*  best of our current understanding of physics everything whether it's electromagnetism or
*  ordinary matter particles like electrons and protons or other forces like the strong nuclear
*  force feel exactly the same gravitational force they feel the same curvature of spacetime so
*  certainly gravity both affects electromagnetism and is affected by electromagnetism because
*  electromagnetic forces have energy and momentum just like everything else liam appleba says
*  you've mentioned that we don't know if the dimensionality of hilbert space is finite or
*  infinite if it were infinite do we know if it's countably infinite or uncountably infinite
*  i don't think we know that i can certainly say that the simple examples that we use in textbooks
*  and so forth where the dimension where where hilbert space is infinite i think it's safe to
*  say it's uncountably infinite but this actually it turns out to be a really really tricky question
*  like take just the simple harmonic oscillator this is everyone's simplest possible quantum system
*  okay so a ball attached to a spring where there's an equilibrium where it can just stay stationary
*  or you can move it away from the equilibrium and will oscillate back and forth there's a quantum
*  version of that and the question of whether or not a vector space is countably infinite or
*  uncountably infinite can be thought of in terms of what is the basis for that vector space and
*  how many basis elements does it have a countably infinite number or an uncountably infinite number
*  in the most straightforward way of thinking about the simple harmonic oscillator you can write it
*  down in a basis which is uncountably infinite the position basis is it located at x1 or x2 or x3
*  but there's another basis the energy level basis which is discrete and countable i should by the
*  way say for those who don't know these words different versions of infinity exist georg
*  contour showed this back in the 19th century countable means a notion of infinity which looks
*  like the integers right from minus one minus two minus three zero one two three the counting
*  numbers and their negative numbers this is a countable infinity what cantor showed is that
*  the continuum the real numbers from minus infinity to infinity has a strictly greater set of numbers
*  in it than the integers does so and they're called uncountable because you can't count them there you
*  go we don't know is the short answer and even in simple examples you could imagine the answer
*  going either way so i'm not sure this there is there are certainly people out there who understand
*  this level of mathematical nicety within quantum mechanics way better than i do so you could look
*  that up on wikipedia probably more likely than i would is a simple harmonic oscillator an example
*  of a countably infinite or uncountably infinite hilbert space once you get to quantum field theory
*  it's pretty clearly uncountably infinite because even the classical theory has uncountably infinite
*  states just like the harmonic oscillator does so anyway short answer is no we don't know i don't
*  know i could see it going either way scott s says in the book powering the future robert loftlin says
*  that we have two broad choices with respect to nuclear power there's enough uranium on earth
*  to either one provide electricity for about 200 years via a process that does not lead to radioactive
*  elements that can be used in nuclear weapons or two essentially provide electricity for thousands
*  of years but the byproducts can be weaponized he does not discuss thorium reactors do you know
*  enough about the subject to comment or can you suggest a resource for further information
*  no i do not know enough about this to comment i i will say the tiny little bit that i have to
*  say about this is i'm quite optimistic about non-nuclear power for the long term solar power
*  especially batteries will get better etc whether or not nuclear power is is very very useful in
*  the short term i'm very open-minded about you know traditionally i was very pro nuclear power
*  but i certainly admit there are many many details that i'm not an expert on martin reese who knows
*  more about than i do was very pro nuclear power in our conversation but 200 years sounds to me
*  like enough time to figure out other sources of power and i am extremely worried about weaponizing
*  nuclear fuel and nuclear reaction products therefore at my current state of very primitive
*  knowledge i'd be much in favor of processes for nuclear power that did not lead to radioactive
*  elements that could be weaponized marion mark holly says i was thinking of recent experiments
*  which seem to conclude that most animals have an innate number sense and can even do some basic
*  math doesn't this hint at a starting point for a more formal universal communication between us
*  and other species i don't think so again i'm not an expert on this but i don't think that the
*  problems for that we have communicating with other species are because we don't have a common
*  language i just don't think that's the problem at all i think that our thoughts are just very
*  different intrinsically right this is super obvious when it comes to most animals right when
*  you try to talk to an ant or a cat you know it we can't teach them a language that will let them
*  chat with us they just don't have the capacity to do that for much smarter animals for you know
*  other primates or dolphins or octopuses or whatever i still don't think that the problem
*  is we don't have a language i think that they don't have the capacity for language that we do
*  i mean they do have some capacity even dogs and cats have some capacity for understanding things
*  we say and for communicating to us with sounds that they make but there are levels that they cannot
*  reach right that that is why human beings are a little bit different i've never heard any animals
*  be trained to use the subjunctive mood in a grammatically proper way for example so i don't
*  really think it's a language that is holding us back ron jacobson says is it workable to approach
*  many worlds by postulating postulating that the universal wave function is a superposition of all
*  possible worlds and that whenever we make a quantum measurement we simply gain some information that
*  narrows down which world we happen to live in yeah you know i think this is a viable way of
*  thinking about many worlds as far as i know so i'll rephrase the suggestion as instead of saying
*  we are in one big world that then splits and differentiates as different subsystems become
*  entangled with each other is it okay to imagine there are many worlds to start but all the worlds
*  to start are identical and then what happens is they simply become different but all the number
*  of worlds are already there from the start people have absolutely looked into this you know can you
*  do it that way there are arguments back and forth i kind of don't care i don't think it's a crucially
*  important distinction honestly like my attitude toward the worlds are that they are a human
*  convenience what really exists is the wave function of the universe and all else is commentary right
*  so what i would do to rephrase that question is are we allowed to talk about quantum mechanics by
*  subdividing into different worlds from the start or do the worlds have to be subdivided later
*  it's certainly more natural for me to imagine subdividing into separate worlds after the
*  individual experiments are done and quantum systems become entangled with their environments
*  because it's only then that the worlds are distinguishable and they can't interact with
*  each other etc right to me that's what makes the world's sensible concept but there are the ways
*  of talking about it and that's fine with me that does not violate any of my deeply held principles
*  sandro stuckey says my question is about the black hole information puzzle where does the randomness
*  in black hole radiation come from and then i added a little bit but he goes on to say you go on to
*  say in hawking's calculation black hole radiation seems not to be deterministic it's truly random
*  even without any branching how is that compatible with the many worlds interpretation which seems to
*  be a deterministic theory is this a defective hawking's calculation or of the many worlds
*  interpretation well i think this is exactly the black hole radiation paradox or puzzle whatever
*  you want to call it the point is that hawking's calculation does not seem to follow the rules of
*  quantum mechanics it does not seem to start well so to be very clear here to anyone who's not been
*  following in quantum mechanics we start with a wave function the wave function of the universe
*  in the many worlds theory we have an equation the generalized version of the schrodinger equation
*  for whatever situation you're interested in that shows us how that equation that wave function
*  evolves and is completely deterministic in many worlds that wave function involves more and more
*  worlds branching toward the future but the overall wave function is still deterministic
*  hawking's calculation says that that single wave function evolves into a super not a super position
*  but a mixture of many different wave functions the technical term is a mixed state or a density
*  matrix or a density operator rather than a single pure wave function so that is not what many worlds
*  sense that is a conflict with many worlds the question is is it a defect of hawking's
*  calculation probably that's what most of us believe right we think that you know he made some
*  assumptions that don't hold true in the real world and we're trying to fix them that is the
*  black hole information puzzle how do you fix them turns out to be really really difficult to fix them
*  but that's what we're trying to do and you know the the jury is not completely in on whether or
*  not it's fixable and many worlds is a perfectly good description of that or whether black holes
*  are truly information destroying which would be the other alternative price graham says in the
*  q a after your brief history of quantum mechanics talk you mentioned that while writing something
*  deeply hidden you made 50 quantum spin measurements for an example you admitted that in some universe
*  you would have measured them all spin up you seem to have shrugged it off like it wasn't a big deal
*  and would have just thought someone broke the machine does that mean that in some branch of
*  the universe there is a poor physicist who has only and will only ever measure spin up so yes
*  that means exactly that and i talk about this in the book and again i think that this is going to
*  come up again later in the a.m.a so let me explain the attitude that i think one should have toward
*  this if you believed in a version of quantum mechanics that was truly stochastic that one
*  in which there was a chance that you would measure 20 spins in a row or 50 spins in a row and get all
*  spin up but it was a small chance that wouldn't bother you right you think that there's more
*  likely things that are more typical less likely things that are less typical if you're going to
*  believe many worlds at all you have to understand that there is a similar attitude
*  toward those things in many worlds it is true that all the universes become true but there are way
*  more where you get the likely outcomes than the ones in which you get the unlikely outcomes
*  so the probabilities work out exactly the same way the fact that there is an extremely extremely
*  low probability universe that really exists but one in which the outcomes of the experiments will
*  be statistically unlikely is fine you can't guarantee that every experimenter is always
*  going to get the right answers that's just a feature of statistics i think that we have a some
*  people have a tendency in many worlds to say well look all the worlds are real and i'm going to
*  implicitly treat them as equally real treat them as equally important but the very very low amplitude
*  worlds should be treated as less important even though they are real that's the only way that
*  many worlds is ever going to make sense petros piscis says when a photon is detected after a
*  double slit experiment how many new worlds are being created i'm not exactly sure what this
*  refers to when it i mean i'm not sure what role the double slit has here if you fire a photon
*  through a screen whether it not whether or not it goes through double slits it will hit the screen
*  at some point and in the typical way of thinking about things where you have an infinite number of
*  positions where the atoms on the screen could be an infinite number of positions where the
*  photon could hit it there are an infinite number of worlds that the universe breaks into but of
*  course once you have an infinity like that you shouldn't be counting the worlds what you can do
*  is you can talk about the relative number of worlds with certain properties versus other
*  properties so what we talk about is the relative number of worlds where the photon hit in this
*  particular location on the screen this particular non-zero area sized box of the screen you sort of
*  coarse grain it and you say what is the probability what is the fraction of worlds that that's where
*  the photon landed those are the kinds of things you can talk about when you have a continuum of
*  possibilities it's it's better to think of it as a continuum of possibilities than as literally an
*  infinite number of worlds even though the words work out the same way vampiricon says have you
*  ever watched the avatar cartoon and the answer is no i haven't so i have no wise things to say about
*  that barry wallace says kirk or picard i have watched star trek and i think i'm going to say
*  here you know i like both i like old star trek which i grew up with even though it was already
*  reruns when i started watching it but um i think as captains go i would rather have jean luc on my
*  side than uh james t kirk he just seems like a little bit more of a level-headed guy simon
*  carter says what was your opinion of freeman dyson and do you think his stance on climate change
*  impacted his reputation i think there's no doubt that freeman dyson was an incredibly good and
*  creative and technically proficient physicist he arguably deserved to share the noble prize you
*  know he helped understand the renormalization of infinities and quantum electrodynamics the prize
*  went to feinman and schwinger and tomanaga and there's a limit right you're only allowed to give
*  the noble prize to three people but dyson certainly would have been um perfectly understandable as a
*  choice along with those folks and he did a whole bunch of other things um he did he worked on the
*  oklo natural reactor for example this thing in africa where there was a naturally occurring
*  nuclear chain reaction which we can use to put limits on the change in the values of physical
*  constants over time has his stance on climate change impacted his reputation well i think that
*  you know his stance on climate change was damaging it's more damaging to the cause of doing something
*  about climate change when a clearly brilliant famous accomplished scientist says we don't need
*  to worry about it than someone who is just off the street so i think that it bothered people that
*  he made such a big deal about it um but you know donald thing it affected his reputation as a
*  physicist i think his ability to do calculations in quantum electrodynamics was just as good as
*  it ever was peter sue says in context of the famous double slit experiment when done with
*  with light of sufficient intensity it's my understanding that you can compute the shape
*  of the interference pattern in two ways first as a classical interference between electromagnetic
*  waves and then also as an interference pattern between the probability amplitudes of the quantum
*  wave function presumably somewhere there's an example of someone doing this calculation both
*  ways and showing to get the right answer this is interesting because a priori one has no reason
*  to believe that electromagnetic waves are at all related to complex probability amplitudes well i
*  think that's not exactly right you know there uh i'm not sure about the phrase a priori here because
*  you know nothing here is a priori at all you're developing a theory and seeing whether it works
*  but the point is there absolutely is a relationship between complex probability amplitudes and
*  electromagnetic waves the classical wave that you get in classical electromagnetism emerges out of
*  the quantum electrodynamic description and the way it emerges is that areas in which the electro
*  electric and magnetic fields are large correspond to large number of photons that would be observed
*  which correspond to a large probability amplitude for observing a bunch of photons
*  so i think in fact that the relationship between them is pretty straightforward and indeed you do
*  get the same answer in that limit of a large occupation number of photons justin bailey says
*  you said previously that the existence of the universe is a brute fact that you accept that's
*  hard for me old as it is i think the first mover argument is hard to refute to refute how do you
*  respond to that argument i think it's super duper easy to refute the first mover argument i mean the
*  whole point of arguments that are similar to the first mover argument you know everything that
*  moves needs a mover blah blah blah blah therefore there's a first mover is to deny the very first
*  premise it's not true that everything that moves needs a mover i mean we've known that for a thousand
*  years since we first started to understand conservation of momentum when you were an
*  aristotelian physicist you look around the world and notice that in order to get things moving you
*  have to push them but we know better now there's a thing called conservation of inertia conservation
*  of momentum the natural thing is for things to be moving and so there does not need to be any
*  explanation for why things move and i think that you know the universe is the same way
*  but in particular even if it weren't it's not at all clear that things that apply to things in the
*  universe necessarily apply to the universe as a whole so i think that the right question to ask in
*  the modern era we know about science is not what caused or what created or what brought into motion
*  the universe but what are the laws of physics that allow the universe to exist and you can then ask
*  yourself are there laws of physics that can describe the universe and its existence in a
*  perfectly self-contained consistent internally coherent way and from everything we know the
*  answer is yes we don't know completely what those laws are yet so we might be wrong about that
*  but we have every reason to believe that such laws exist you don't need to imagine there's
*  anything outside the universe to bring it into existence humberto nani says besides that we can
*  only move to the future what other facts of our universe make it look like we're inside a black
*  hole i don't think that there's any facts about our universe that make it look like the inside of a
*  black hole i am on record as saying please do not think that the universe is looks like the inside
*  of a black hole black holes are things that exist in otherwise empty space where there's a region
*  of space with an event horizon around them with the property that things can come into the event
*  horizon and join us in the region but they can't go out that's what a black hole is that is not
*  what our universe is as far as we know at all if anything our universe is kind of like the time
*  reverse of a black hole it's kind of like a white hole where there is a singularity in the past
*  rather than the future but even then it's not exactly like that it's the universe it's a
*  different thing than a black hole gregor's anilak says how much time do you spend on these ask me
*  anything episodes do you prepare the answers or do you go with the flow live so i think what i
*  generally do is i try to get go into the patreon post i cut and paste all the questions into a
*  separate text document then i go through all the questions and i try to edit them down a little
*  bit you know some some folks tend to go on a little bit in their question asking which is fine but
*  not everyone else listening necessarily wants to hear the entire question so i try to edit them
*  down to the essence of it and while i'm doing that i will think a little bit about what answer
*  i'm going to give and then once that editing is done i can go in and actually answer them in real
*  time the editing and the and the thinking about answers will take a couple of hours two or three
*  hours typically and then the recording also takes two or three hours typically i i always aspire to
*  just go through in one fell swoop and do all the questions it rarely happens either my voice goes
*  out or something like that so over the course of an afternoon on the weekend i can usually get it
*  done paul torek says here's a scenario to explore the ideas of downward causation and mixing levels
*  of explanation a crystallographer uses a very narrow x-ray beam to analyze the microscopic
*  shifts in metals that have been subjected to stress she takes an aluminum automotive part
*  manufactured by a new process and analyzes the particular 90 degree elbow at which these parts
*  typically fall she rotates the part just so and places it in the analyzer she subjects the part
*  to a certain cycle of stresses then rotates the part to the same orientation and places the elbow
*  in the same position with sub-millimeter accuracy her microscopic her macroscopic actions determine
*  which microscopic crystals are subjected to x-rays and which aren't what why doesn't this
*  explanation count as mixing levels or downward causation so there's two reasons why i don't think
*  it counts as downward causation it does in some sense count as mixing levels just because the
*  macroscopic level gives us a description of the world which is necessarily incomplete if you have
*  a description of the world where there's no such things as atoms where there are pieces of metal
*  and there are you know machines and things like that you can deal with them then you can use that
*  description to describe what happens only up to the point where your description doesn't need to
*  require any reference to atoms if you use your macroscopic world to observe atoms and then you
*  take actions on the basis of what you've observed then your purely macroscopic description does not
*  suffice to explain exactly what happened so you can aid it you can abet it augment it i guess is
*  the word i'm looking for here you can augment it which is what we do in the real world by using a
*  macroscopic description that also dips into a microscopic description when necessary and then
*  goes back to the macroscopic description and that's perfectly fine there's nothing wrong with that
*  but alternatively you could completely describe things at the microscopic level you don't need
*  to refer to a crystallographer or a machine or anything you could just refer to what the atoms
*  are doing and you would get the right answer if you had laplace's demon level of specificity about
*  what was going on you would say exactly what was happening without any reference to what was happening
*  at the higher level whatsoever that's why downward causation is not necessary for these to understand
*  these actions andre mirabelli says what criteria do you support for determining which recurrent
*  process should be used as the standard good clock to determine whether one time interval has the
*  same duration as a subsequent one so that competing fundamental theories can be fairly adjudicated
*  i don't really have any dog in this fight as we say this is a technological question about what
*  makes the best clocks right you know some frequency of some atomic transition or nuclear transition or
*  something like that that is way more specific and technological than anything that i'm an expert in
*  sorry about that gregory kusnik says what's on the chalkboard behind you in your patreon profile
*  picture uh that was a picture taken at caltech so it's a chalkboard at caltech with some lagrangians
*  for quantum field theories behind me or maybe some actions or something like that but anyway some
*  equations for quantum field theory i don't remember the specific ones in fact i didn't write them they
*  were there already when we just took the picture it was in a public area not in my office
*  ramon rocha says do you enjoy stories about the paranormal or supernatural and have you ever
*  personally experienced something very strange that you couldn't rationally explain uh so i enjoy all
*  sorts of stories about things i don't think are true i mean i'm a big fan of the marvel movies
*  for that matter um have i personally experienced anything that i can't rationally explain sure
*  there's plenty of things that i can't explain the different i think what you're getting at is are
*  there things which i think do not have a rational explanation and for there the answer is no i think
*  that again like a good bayesian we know enough about the laws of physics and how they work and
*  how successful they are to think that whenever something happens i'm going to put a very very
*  very high credence in a completely physicalist naturalist rational explanation it would have to
*  be a very very blatant and unmistakable violation of the laws of physics before i started shifting
*  my credences to something supernatural or paranormal sandy chitalay says presumably the big bang started
*  from a single point one point can only be arranged one way one microstate equals one macrostate
*  therefore it's the lowest entropy why is that not right so it's not right for a few reasons
*  the big bang did not start from a single point it started well it depends what you mean right
*  um the big bang in classical general relativity is a point at which the curvature of space time is
*  infinitely big and therefore that point is not described by classical general relativity so you
*  simply cannot say anything about it what you should do is sort of imagine cutting off that point
*  stopping your description just before you get there and then what you have is space and time
*  immediately after the big bang and space and time space itself could be infinitely big in extent
*  there is no limit how big space could be more so therefore there's no reason whatsoever for it to be
*  a single point or just in one microstate or one macrostate and it's more specific than that right
*  the big bang is not a point even if you cheat and add it back in to the description the big bang is
*  a moment of time it is a moment that before which there are no other moments if that is indeed the
*  description that is true for the real universe which we don't know you can you can verify all
*  of this by thinking about the big bang in reverse right thinking about a big crunch if you let a
*  whole bunch of matter and energy crunch and in a contracting universe instead of expanding as we
*  think that our past actually did there's absolutely no reason for the universe to smooth out as it
*  crunches together all of the things that we know about the laws of physics predict that it would
*  get lumpier and lumpier the higher entropy states are extremely inhomogeneous and lumpy as you
*  approach that singularity that's how we know that the real big bang whatever it was that created a
*  universe was extremely smooth was much much lower entropy than it needed to be james o sullivan
*  says in the double slit experiment why does the electrons interaction with the slits not cause
*  decoherence are the slits themselves not already entangled with the environment or is it because
*  the slits don't interact with electromagnetic radiation well you have to be a little bit careful
*  here i mean the double slit experiment is an idealization for real slits they might very well
*  become entangled with the electron going through if you're not too careful but in the idealization
*  of the typical traditional double slit experiment you're imagining that the state of the double
*  slits the state of the barrier through which the electrons are trying to pass is completely
*  unaffected by the electron therefore there is no entanglement generated between the electron and
*  the slits right and therefore decoherence is not going to happen decoherence is always the
*  entanglement between the quantum system you're looking at and the wider environment
*  if the slits are not affected then there's nothing there entangling the electron
*  Aldo Mendez Martins says could the fact that from the perspective of a photon the universe seems to
*  be frozen in time be the reason why in the delayed choice to slit experiment the photons interfere
*  with all photons past and present could it be that all photons exist at the same time but in
*  different positions in space so you have to distinguish between the time that is read by a
*  clock moving along some trajectory versus the time as seen from the outside when people say
*  that photons experience no time this is just a way of saying that the literal space time interval
*  along a light like trajectory is zero what it would be more accurate to say is that there just
*  is no clock that can pass along that can be carried along by a photon it's not like the photon is
*  experiencing no time it's the time is not something that the photon could experience if that's the
*  sensible distinction to make but of course we have time passing as the photon passes by us
*  there's absolutely no problem with assigning a time of each to each point in the photons trajectory
*  it's just the time that we use as a coordinate not the time of the photon is experiencing so i would
*  say there's no truth to the idea that all photons past present and future are interfering or
*  interacting with each other in any way according to the laws of physics as we understand them
*  things only interact when they are at the same moment of time linear mizziara says is the block
*  universe an unescapable consequence of special relativity or can we conjecture an alternative
*  view of time apart from the b theory of time so the b theory of time refers to this idea that
*  there really is a block universe the a theory in this this nomenclature that was put forward by
*  mick taggart years ago the a theory is one in which the present moment exists and sort of it
*  marches forward in time so most physicists are b theorists they believe that all time is equally
*  real to the extent that they care which is not very much and one of the arguments put forward is
*  of course special relativity in special relativity there's no preferred way to slice the universe
*  into moments of time different observers will do it differently so how in the world could what is
*  real depend on how a single observer chooses to slice the universe into different moments of time
*  so is that an escapable argument you know almost all arguments are escapable i don't want to say
*  it's an unescapable consequence uh this a philosophical perspective right it's not really
*  a prediction that is made by some physical theory so i think that there definitely as an empirical
*  matter are people in the world who perfectly accept special relativity and yet do not accept the block
*  universe so there you go it must not be an unescapable consequence but also you know i i
*  think that on the flip side of that i believe that the block universe is perfectly sensible
*  and would be even without special relativity i think the simple fact of conservation of information
*  and the fact that what you know at one moment of time is enough to predict the past present and
*  future is enough to convince me that the block universe is the a good perspective to bring to
*  these kinds of questions a non anonymous questioner says physics outsiders hear a lot of
*  non-established theories but it's hard to separate out what's probable and what's speculative what
*  are your rapid-fire unjustified not really thinking credences for these hypotheses being true are there
*  any propositions where your personal credences differ from most of the physics establishment
*  so there's a long list of propositions that i'm being asked for credences for so i've edited down
*  a little bit but most of them are still here so is dark matter made of wimps you know i would have
*  said 80 chance but we haven't found them and the lhc hasn't found anything so now i'm down to about
*  50 chance more than one percent of dark matter interacts with itself with dark forces i think
*  that's very unlikely maybe five percent chance or ten percent chance that that's true something like
*  that it's conceivable i would love it i'm the author of various theories along those lines
*  but i don't see any real strong evidence for it yet axions exist i think that's a good axions are
*  a good idea i might put them at a 30 or 40 chance of being real magnetic monopoles exist i think
*  that there's very very tiny credence that magnetic monopole exists that we might find in our observable
*  universe but it's possible magnetic monopoles are conceivable according to the laws of physics that
*  might actually govern our universe i just don't think that we have any lying around tachyons
*  exist i think is a negligible credence you know way less than one percent neutrinos have mass and
*  travel less than the speed of light i think that's true 99 plus photons have mass and travel at the
*  speed of light i think that's false less than one percent supersymmetry something like supersymmetry
*  at some energy we don't know where it is i would put um i think that's probably likely it's one of
*  those things that you know just seems to make everything nicer if it exists so maybe 60 or 70
*  credence on that the standard model has something really wrong with it that we've already discovered
*  but just don't realize it i think that's unlikely right now so that's less than 10 chance for me
*  same as above for gr less than two percent chance we have will have replaced the standard model in
*  my lifetime that's a tough one um that's one where i don't even trust my own credences because i
*  really really really want it to be true that we will have superseded the standard model in my
*  lifetime but we don't seem to be right there we don't seem to be on the verge or the cusp of it
*  happening so i will put a 40 percent credence that will have done it but that might be overly
*  optimistic or pessimistic it's just very hard to tell jeffrey irving says what's your credence
*  that we can do an infinite amount of useful contribution in our future light cone i expect
*  this to be low but not zero and i'm curious as to where your main non-zero term would come from
*  um i'm going to apologize because i don't know exactly how to turn this into an operationally
*  well-defined question i don't know what an infinite amount of useful contribution would really be i
*  mean depends on useful it depends on what sort of measure we use to measure the amount of usefulness
*  things like that i will say that i think that the simplest version of what we currently understand
*  about cosmology predicts that the universe will equilibrate and reach maximum entropy in some
*  finite time and so the smart money is on a finite amount of anything uh existing in our future like
*  on any influence we might have but you know there we don't know so i think that there's some non-zero
*  credence on any other possibility so um yeah i really i can't give a very specific answer to
*  where the main non-zero term would come from because i'm not quite sure what i'm being asked
*  to imagine sorry about that abdul abzal says if you were to organize moving naturalism forward
*  2.0 sometime this year which five people would you like to participate in the conference so i'm
*  gonna i'm gonna punt on this one a little bit because i don't like to answer questions like
*  this because you know i might do it right i might actually organize a conference but i haven't done
*  it i don't i haven't decided what kinds of person i would invite to something like that so i don't
*  want to sort of say it out loud who i would invite and then end up not inviting them does
*  that make sense does that make sense to you um but i think that you can get an idea of some people
*  who i think would be good by looking at former guests of the mindscape podcast and asking
*  yourself you know which of these people are the kinds that might do well at a conference on
*  naturalism you know i think that uh someone like patricia churchland i can mention out loud because
*  she was actually invited to the first moving naturalism forward conference and couldn't make
*  it just because of personal reasons that time but there's a bunch of people among the guests who
*  you know have thoughtful ideas about how the universe works at a deep level and how we can
*  connect those to ideas about morality and living in the universe and consciousness and the origin
*  of life all of these big questions that naturalists have to face up to so play the game the other way
*  make up your own moving naturalism forward conference out of pre-existing guests from
*  the mindscape podcast george clune says many cosmologists believe inflationary cosmology is
*  the best way to describe the very early universe however i think that in a previous podcast you
*  said it was probably not right what are the main arguments against this idea and what is the best
*  competing theory uh so i don't think i said it's probably not right i think that inflation is one
*  of those things which i put 50 credence on it's uh inflation is really good at certain things
*  what it's good at will be different when you listen to different people giving you the sales
*  pitch for it i i definitely have a minority point of view on this because i take the entropy of the
*  early universe problem very very seriously and inflation makes that problem worse inflation
*  makes the early universe sensible by positing an even lower entropy initial condition than the
*  conventional big bang model does so that's why i don't think that it's anywhere near close to
*  a sufficient answer to why the early universe looks the way it does but it might be part
*  of a more comprehensive answer you know in the paper that i wrote with jennifer chen years ago
*  15 years ago now about the multiverse in the arrow of time we absolutely used inflation as a crucial
*  element in our theory there's another paper i wrote with lisa randall and matt johnson about
*  changing the number of dimensions dynamically where again inflation would play an important
*  role in connecting a theory like that to reality so i'm all in favor inflation in that sense what i
*  really think inflation does is it gives you leverage for inventing theories where the initial
*  conditions of our universe are set at the plank scale at the plank distance the physical size of
*  our universe might only be one plank length across and inflation could help explain how it
*  expands up to the universe we see whereas in conventional hot big bang cosmology at the moment
*  when the curvature and density was at the plank scale the physical size of our observable universe
*  was more like a centimeter across which is some crazily jihumongous length scale for particle
*  physics to try to explain so in some sense inflation gives you an attractive easy target
*  that's the good news the bad news is it requires extra fine tuning to make it happen and we don't
*  really have a compelling mechanism for which it really did happen we have not i guess we have many
*  mechanisms we don't have any way of choosing between the different possibilities
*  rick coyote says if neutrinos are so multitudinous why are they so hard to detect it seems to me that
*  they're just sheer numbers where the detector is going off constantly so i think that you're not
*  thinking about this hard enough rick uh of course for any one detector there will be a probability
*  that if a neutrino goes through it the detector will go off okay because neutrinos are very
*  weakly interacting that probability is a small number so you take that probability times the
*  number of neutrinos passing through to get the total number that you expect to see in any one
*  run of your experiment no matter how many neutrinos there are i can invent a probability
*  that any one of them will be involved will be detected that is so small that the expected
*  number of neutrinos you see is zero or very very close to zero is much much less than one let's put
*  it that way so i this is a case where you just have to like write down the equation right you
*  can't just sort of intuit it off your head there's always an interaction that is so weak that no
*  matter how many particles there are you will not observe them victor alejandro weiner says i have
*  a silly question this time around do you know sean b carol have you read his books on evo devo
*  evolution and development um i do know my evil twin sean b carol he's a couple years older than
*  me but he has the beard so that's how you know he's the evil twin uh he is one of the very few
*  people i will happily admit is a future target for the mindscape podcast he wrote writes great
*  books about evolution and development i highly recommend them paul has says many worlds is often
*  described by taking talking about worlds existing with all possible choices being made but why do
*  we believe for any good reason that sean's free will is due to random quantum processes instead
*  of just being dependent on classical but currently unknown states and brain mechanisms relating to
*  the state of his brain such as his mood etc well paul i recommend that you buy a book that i've
*  seen on sale called something deeply hidden which talks about exactly this kind of thing great
*  detail and that book will go to great lengths to tell you that there is no relationship whatsoever
*  between the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and choices being made by human beings
*  there's just no relationship at all one way or the other it's not that making choices causes causes
*  world a branch it's not that world's branching causes choices to be made these are two separate
*  things and indeed i agree with you i think that for the most part the workings of the brain are
*  perfectly classical but we just don't know the specific microscopic states that's what gives us
*  uncertainty about what decisions are going to be made not anything to do with quantum mechanics
*  zane jacob says i'm a master student in applied math doing research in scientific machine learning
*  and recently i've been thinking about how to do effective reduced order modeling when you don't
*  have good intuition for the underlying dynamics this relates pretty naturally to the problem of
*  coarse graining quantum mechanics so my question is essentially how should one go about finding an
*  effective coarse graining when you really have no idea what exactly you're looking for i think this
*  is a really good question actually and i think that it's one that has been under addressed in
*  the literature in part because people don't take many worlds seriously enough ashmeet singh who
*  is a student at caltech he and i have been trying to develop what we call mad dog everettianism
*  where not only do you have the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics but you
*  don't assume any structure pre-existing that gives you a classical handle on the wave function you
*  have to get that structure to emerge out of it and so there's good ideas from other people about how
*  locality and spatial positions can emerge we wrote one paper ashmeet and i on how you could use
*  principal component analysis to get a coarse graining where you didn't know much about
*  the quantum dynamics but i think that there's a there's people were writing right now which
*  is much more relevant to the question you're asking on what we call quantum miri ology
*  that's the question of how you divide systems in divide holes into parts that's what miri ology is
*  the relationship between holes and parts so to an everettian where you think that the whole world
*  is described by a single wave function if that's all you know is the wave function and the hamiltonian
*  that tells you how it's evolves then the mechanism to go from there to a certain way of
*  characterizing the wave function so that you can coarse grain it is highly non-trivial it has to do
*  with entropy you'll be unsurprised to learn and it has to do with emergence and it has to do with
*  the existence of effective higher level descriptions which require just an incomplete amount of
*  information basically what you want to do is look for the factorization into system and environment
*  so that the system states have as much classical behavior as they can well the minimum amount of
*  entanglement growth between the system and its environment so this is what you need to look like
*  an emergent coarse grained higher level classical world but making that operational i think there's
*  still a lot of work to be done in that so i don't think there's any final answers quite yet
*  maxime alexandrovitz says my question is regarding quantum computers let's say it will soon be
*  possible to create a very accurate model of a small part of the universe for example our moon
*  what would be the discretization level of such a model as far as i understand with traditional
*  computers there's always a limit in which you could say aha you missed part of the simulation
*  because of the discretization could such a model be indistinguishable from our real moon could a
*  quantum model even on subatomic particle level and therefore could it be a real world inside a
*  real world so i'm not exactly sure what you're saying but i think i i think i understand you
*  know even though there are a finite number of qubits in a quantum computer as we said because
*  hilbert space is a vector space there's always an infinite number of quantum states that could be
*  described by that set of qubits unlike a truly classical set of bits where there's only a finite
*  number of ones and zeros right a single qubit has an infinite number of possible states because you
*  can add any linear combination of spin up and spin down for example however that is not enough
*  to model something like the moon which has a lot of particles to correctly model something like the
*  moon without any loss of information due to discretization or something equivalent to
*  discretization would require a hilbert space as large as the hilbert space of the moon so roughly
*  speaking you would need a quantum computer as large as the moon and then you're not really
*  computing the moon you're just simulating it you're just making a copy of it paulina baron says i'm
*  interested in what your stand is on universal basic income uh so i'm in favor of it i think it's a great
*  idea you know i'm someone who believes that you help people out by giving them money right i'm
*  not someone who believes that you're cheating people out of the chance of getting dignity by
*  not giving them money and insisting that they work you know working is good for some people
*  it's drudgery and bad for other people income is good for just about everybody so i'm in favor of
*  doing it i've done no careful research into the feasibility or the best way to get there or anything
*  like that so i think it's a wonderful goal to have something to work toward i'm not exactly
*  sure what the best route to getting there really is charles hertz says suppose that there were a
*  civilization on another planet whose science and technology were for all practical purposes
*  identical to ours in 2020 suppose that the inhabitants were aware through astronomy of
*  the existence of our earth and for whatever reason set about to look intensively for science of
*  intelligent life there can you give me a ballpark estimate of how far away their planet could be
*  and still leave them with a decent chance of success uh no i really can't that sounds like
*  a homework problem that i would have to sit down and do some calculations for presumably it could
*  be done but it depends not only on what we are beaming out into the universe but the sensitivity
*  of the radio telescopes that they would be using to look for us etc so it's a doable problem but
*  one that i don't really have the time to sit down and do um i do think that it brings up this related
*  fact that looking for intelligent civilizations by scanning the sky in radio telescopes is something
*  that i personally think is incredibly unlikely to ever work because i think that the chances for
*  another civilization in our state of technological capability to be right there at the right time is
*  extremely low and once civilization gets to a higher level of technological capability they're
*  not going to wastefully beam out radio waves into the surrounding space for no good reason
*  so i think there's better ways to look for technological civilizations elsewhere
*  patrick phreeney says the controversy about the hubble constant being either
*  69.7 kilometers per second per megaparsec versus 73.5 rages on given the two different methods
*  are being used for the calculation why is it so important that there's a small discrepancy between
*  them that is labeled a cosmic crisis so i talked about this a little bit earlier on but look i
*  don't label it a cosmic cosmic crisis i think there's a certain amount of marketing that is
*  going on in labeling it a cosmic crisis it would be a cosmic opportunity if it were true because
*  it would be telling us something really important about the universe but you know to be fair let's
*  put it on the other side the two methods should agree right i mean just because you use two methods
*  if you're measuring the same thing and you believe in an external reality you're supposed to get the
*  same answer so either something's really going on or one of the methods is wrong it's not that
*  because they're two methods they're measuring different things so one way or the other there's
*  something to be figured out that we haven't quite figured out yet michael mcready says i struggle
*  with the idea that the big bang occurred everywhere and that regardless of where you find yourself in
*  the universe you would essentially observe the same cosmic surroundings why if you found yourself
*  on the expanding edge of the universe would you not see an empty night sky in the direction of
*  that edge so the answer here is that there's no such thing as the expanding edge of the universe
*  there's the expanding edge of what we can see from here but if you were there then what we
*  can see from here would be irrelevant we would be on the edge as far as you're concerned and
*  we're not sure what you would see if you looked in the other direction but the easiest most natural
*  most likely thing to imagine is that it's similar to what we see in the universe where we do observe
*  in our current universe in other words that things are more or less uniform from the perspective of
*  someone who is far away 10 billion or 20 billion light years away just as they are to us right here
*  right now there's no edge to the universe there's no sensible cosmological model in which the
*  universe has anything like a real edge it could be infinite or it could be finite it could be
*  homogeneous and isotropic or it could be very very different but there's no reason to think it has an
*  edge Jose Ignacio Alcantara Alcantara Alcantara yeah says I very much agree with your approach
*  that if we are to develop a quantum theory of gravity it makes much more sense to look
*  for it arising from a quantum origin than a classical one but to my mind there's a hiccup
*  what if quantum theory turns out not to be a fundamental description of fundamental reality
*  to this end I was hoping that you might lease mole invite lease mullen for one of your podcasts
*  soon so you know it's always possible that quantum theory is not a fundamental description
*  of reality but as I said in a different context above as a researcher you have to bet
*  right as a researcher you can't always say you know what all of our theories could be wrong I'm
*  going to distrust all of them and try to build up everything from the ground up that's not really
*  a way to get ahead usually so I'm glad that some people are thinking about alternatives to quantum
*  mechanics but there is literally zero empirical evidence that quantum mechanics is not right
*  and there are plenty of theoretical and philosophical and practical questions
*  about quantum mechanics we don't know the answer to so in my mind the way more promising way forward
*  is to try to understand the quantum mechanics we have rather than to try to throw it out and
*  replace it with something else Joshua Hillerup says suppose a big expensive experiment is done
*  in space where according to general relativity a small kugel blitz is made of a size where it
*  should evaporate due to hawking radiation in a reasonable time frame to observe for an experiment
*  a kugel blitz is an idea of like a ball of radiation that you point to a small enough
*  region to create a black hole assuming the experiment was performed correctly and there
*  are no great advances in quantum gravity before then would it be guaranteed to give us useful
*  data or could it potentially just confirm what is already known we would certainly like to see
*  up close the evaporation of a black hole and its final explosion but there is no guarantee
*  whatsoever they would give us useful data so we have a prediction for what would happen
*  it would dissolve in a bunch of particles it might be that more massive particles than we can create
*  in current particle accelerators would be made but they would be expected to very rapidly decay
*  into other particles so the whole point of hawking's calculation is that what you expect to see coming
*  out of a black hole is thermal radiation radiation which has a more or less featureless black body
*  spectrum the one example the one counter example of this is if there are particles at very high
*  energies very high masses which are stable or quasi stable or long lived enough that we could
*  actually observe them that would be a wonderful new data if there was something about quantum
*  gravity that deviated from hawking's calculation of course that would be wonderful wonderful new
*  data but there's absolutely no guarantee that we would learn anything new there very rarely
*  are guarantees when you do physics experiments anton grace says i would like to ask you if there
*  if you were always this open-minded or if you had a different mentality in regards to the usefulness
*  and purpose of philosophy in the past and if so what changed you i don't think i was ever of the
*  opinion that philosophy was useless um i just didn't know or think that much about philosophy
*  when i was in high school when i was an undergraduate and started to study it i
*  instantly thought it was fascinating and potentially important i certainly went through a phase where i
*  was one of these people who thought that all of the interesting questions of philosophy could sort
*  of be tackled scientifically right like right and wrong could be decided on purely rational
*  empirical scientific bases and i changed my mind about that i'm much more subjective about the
*  notions of morality and ethics now than i used to be riverside says would you agree that we
*  are morally obliged to take preventative measures available to us in our present time to help avert
*  or mitigate the terrible crimes that our future selves persons branching out of us at each
*  decoherence event will commit against the future selves of our loved ones in some of the branching
*  pads of the many worlds universe so there's a couple of reasons that the answer here is no
*  one is of course the notion of moral obligation is a little fuzzy and i generally don't like to
*  use that notion in contentious uh issues i mean we might use it casually when we all agree on what
*  the morality is so in tricky questions i'd like to be a little bit more careful than that but more
*  importantly as i've already discussed earlier in the ama i think that the moral implications of many
*  worlds are exactly the same as the moral implications of a version of quantum mechanics
*  which was truly stochastic in which there was only one world but you just couldn't predict
*  what would happen i think that there are unlikely things that will happen and there are likely
*  things that would happen and we should adjust our actions accordingly i don't think that many worlds
*  has any moral implications aside from regular quantum mechanics whatsoever p walder says in the
*  recent episode of the infinite monkey cage you indicated that the many worlds interpretation
*  naturally comes out of the equations of quantum mechanics jim jim alcalili in the same episode
*  indicated the many worlds view is not implied in the fundamental equations can you clarify
*  for me whether it is or is not um i so it depends on what you mean okay i hate to be weasely about
*  that but got to be honest the equations of many worlds are just the schrodinger equation and the
*  wave function evolving that's the fundamental definition of the theory unlike other versions
*  of quantum mechanics or unlike classical mechanics or something like that the tricky part of many
*  worlds is explaining why that theory accounts for the world we see okay quantum mechanics you know
*  when we teach it in schools that's when we use words like measurement and observation right there
*  in the theory so explaining the outcomes of measurement or observations is not hard because
*  it's baked into the rules in many worlds there are no words about measurements or observations
*  there aren't even words about worlds or branching or decoherence those are all extra words that we
*  human beings use as an convenient emergent way of talking about the wave function of the universe
*  so that's why there can be this disagreement about whether or not the many worlds theory
*  comes out of the equations the theories equations are just the equations there's no extra equations
*  no extra ingredients put on there but there is extra philosophical work to be done to explain
*  why that theory predicts the world that we see someone like me and many of the other people who
*  have thought about this say well yes it clearly does there's clearly different parts of the wave
*  function that don't interact and describe separate worlds etc others do not see it that way
*  judith marsh says whenever i see illustrations of black holes they're always drawn like a world pool
*  or funnel with things falling in the hole from the top you can't approach it from the bottom
*  would a real black hole's entire spherical surface send matter towards its center in all three
*  dimensions do black holes have an equator so i presume what you're thinking about are these
*  sort of funnel-like diagrams where you see curved space time and you sort of go down into the funnel
*  you know let's be honest these are picturesque representations that are trying to help you
*  visualize something and they're not very accurate for one thing they're not very accurate because
*  black holes are regions of warped space time not just warped space there's no up or down in
*  space time but there is the future and the point of a black hole is once you enter the event horizon
*  in the future of yourself you will eventually hit the singularity so do black holes have an equator
*  you know it depends on whether the black hole is spinning or not a black hole can be spinning in
*  which case it absolutely has an axis and an equator a non-spinning black hole is perfectly
*  spherically symmetric so there's no difference in whatever direction you actually travel into it
*  sam hartzog says my question is about gravity the maxim for general relativity goes space tells
*  matter how to move matter tells space how to curve so is it more correct to imagine the force
*  of gravity is acting on space time itself with the apparent action on matter being a byproduct
*  of the spatial curvature imparted by gravity i was thinking about gravitons when my mind went down
*  this rabbit hole so if you could give a little context on how gravitons might play into the
*  answer i give you 50 bonus points so you know the um it's actually a slightly trickier question than
*  you might even think because when we teach general relativity like if you buy my general
*  relativity book and learn it from there what you'll be taught is the following that you solve
*  einstein's equations einstein's equations give you a consistent simultaneous description of the
*  energy generated by matter what's called the energy momentum tensor and the curvature of space time
*  it sets them equal to each other but the geometry of space time is described by what we call the
*  metric which tells you how space time curves is involved in both of those parts it's involved in
*  both the curvature of space time obviously but also in the distribution of matter and energy
*  through the universe so you have to look for a simultaneous solution all at once and then once
*  you do that once you find a solution to the geometry of space time when you talk about you
*  know how a planet goes around the sun or how a ray of light is deflected by the curvature of space
*  time you idealize the planet or the photon as having no gravitational field itself that's a
*  little bit of an idealization right you're asking how a test particle would move through a curved
*  space time that it wasn't itself affecting but in the real world everything that has any energy
*  whatsoever is going to both affect and be affected by the curvature of space time around it so it's
*  it's not really that gravity is acting on space time i mean gravity is a feature of space time
*  but that feature is not separate from what the matter is doing you have to sort of solve for both
*  simultaneously at the same time gravitons play into the answer not at all unless you imagine
*  quantizing gravity and then it's exactly like electromagnetism and photons right you can talk
*  about a classical electric field or magnetic field or you can talk about them in photons and
*  there's a translation between the two but if they're big in classical fields there's no reason to
*  talk about photons likewise for big classical gravitational fields there's no reason to talk
*  about gravitons fred alexander says scott aronson stated in the lex friedman podcast that the
*  greatest use of quantum computing will be studying quantum systems thereby learning more about quantum
*  mechanics do you agree and if so how and what might we learn so i'm not sure what the greatest
*  use of quantum mechanics is going to be studying quantum systems is absolutely one of the most
*  obvious things you can do it was the original motivation for people like feinman in the early
*  years of quantum computing so clearly a quantum computer is going to have an easier time simulating
*  and therefore analyzing quantum systems than a classical computer will just because of computational
*  capacity but i don't know whether that's going to be the killer app or not i can imagine there's
*  other apps that i haven't thought of yet what are we going to learn about quantum mechanics you know
*  i don't think we will learn anything about the foundations of quantum mechanics because i think
*  the foundations of quantum mechanics are pretty much in place i think what we'll learn is how the
*  foundations play out how the actual quantum interactions and entanglement and things like
*  that arise and affect things in the real world where things are too hard to simulate on a classical
*  computer so we'll learn a lot about chemistry for example you know chemistry at heart is all
*  quantum mechanics right how different atoms trade electrons back and forth and so forth that's all
*  quantum mechanics and we're not very good at approximating it that's why chemists have a
*  job and you know mixed chemicals in their labs we can't really simulate it for any interestingly
*  complex systems so i think that we'll learn about how quantum mechanics manifests in the world not
*  about what the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics are alan peterson says a simple
*  clarification question how has the expansion of the universe changed over time did it start fast
*  with inflation slow down and now accelerate so this is a good question actually because it's tricky
*  what do you mean by the expansion of the universe here's how i would put it the sensible way to
*  quantify the expansion rate of the universe is through the hubble parameter right we call it the
*  hubble constant but of course it changes over time and if you do it that way the hubble parameter
*  only ever decreases throughout the history of the universe as the universe expands the hubble
*  parameter depends on the energy density and the energy density ever only goes down until the
*  cosmological constant kicks in and it begins to asymptote to a constant so when we say the
*  universe is accelerating we don't really mean the expansion rate is speeding up in particular
*  the hubble constant is not speeding up during the expansion rate of the during the accelerating
*  phase of the universe's history rather what happens is individual galaxies for which you say
*  the velocity that you observe is their distance times the hubble constant that goes up with time
*  because the hubble constant becomes constant and their distance increases so the apparent velocity
*  goes up if v equals h times d velocity is hubble constant times distance in the ordinary way of
*  thinking about things the distance is increasing but the hubble constant is decreasing even faster
*  so the galaxy looks like it's decelerating away but when the hubble constant approaches a constant
*  the increasing distance leads to an increasing velocity and that's what we characterize as the
*  acceleration of the universe it doesn't mean the expansion rate is going up
*  Nikos Tzagarakis sorry i'm just having a bad day today with the pronunciation of the names i do
*  apologize for that but he says Nikos is nice enough to say do not worry if you cannot pronounce my
*  name just call me Tzagar all right Tzagar says the thought is the following would a Laplace's
*  demon need to be conscious at all the Laplacian demon i'm talking about would not be a result
*  of evolution but be an agent that was from the beginning on that level of computational capacity
*  so again i think it depends on how what do you really mean by Laplace's demon so i could imagine
*  a version of Laplace's demon that was conscious or one that was not conscious so think of it this way
*  you know we think that our universe is big and there's all these particles in it and so forth
*  but what if we really do live in a simulation what if we live in a simulation where the creatures
*  that are simulating us are just enormously bigger and better than us in calculational capacity
*  and power so much so that to them looking at literally everything in our observable universe
*  is equivalent to us looking at a tic-tac-toe board okay it might be hard to imagine that but you can
*  in principle imagine it's just a scaling right so to them they're perfectly conscious and as far as
*  we're concerned they're Laplace's demon right like most of us don't have trouble imagining where the
*  tic-tac-toe game is going to go soon especially if it were a deterministic automaton rather than
*  a game played by oppositional antagonistic opponents so i can imagine a version of Laplace's
*  demon that was perfectly conscious on the other hand i can also imagine a very minimal one one
*  that was more like just a computer right just like a computer that was simulating our universe with
*  perfect fidelity that kind of Laplace's demon wouldn't need to be conscious at all so i think
*  that the original thought experiment from Laplace just doesn't determine the answer to these questions
*  but you're you're very open very willing very able to think of different versions of it
*  Bram blank says i know that you know that evolution is a thing and you've talked about the continuing
*  evolution of the human race in some of your podcasts i've always felt that we are actually
*  de-evolving as a race due to medical science as well as societal pressures making it possible
*  for people to survive who would not have survived in the totally natural environment like the
*  environment where humans first evolved do you think we are de-evolving or are there offsetting
*  pressures causing further evolution in a positive way i think i would just unask this question or
*  at least i would deny the premises behind it there's i think there's no such thing as de-evolution
*  i think that what seems to be implicit in the question you're asking is the idea that evolution
*  natural selection right in the darwinian sense is somehow progressive it somehow makes us more and
*  more powerful or intelligent or complicated or something like that but there is absolutely
*  nothing like that inherent in evolution evolution is not a story of progress it's just a story of
*  adaptation to a changing environment and it's you know slow and there's a lot of randomness in it
*  but certainly in evolution all over the place there's the there are examples of capacities that
*  species had being lost over time right there are species that used to have eyes that then burrowed
*  underground and lost the ability to see for example it's still evolution it's not de-evolution in any
*  way their circumstances changed therefore what kind of animal they were also changed so i do
*  think that evolution continues on like it or not you know we can tinker with our environment we can
*  even tinker with our genome at this point in time but it is still true that sexual reproduction and
*  mutation is going to lead to a slight set of changes in our genome over time and they will
*  be selected for the pressures that select for different traits might be completely different
*  in our current environment than they were 10 000 or 100 000 or a million years ago but there still
*  are pressures certain kind of genomes are going to give rise to more offspring than other kinds
*  that's just not going to stop happening gabor peter sayser says it was good to see you in your
*  office in the video of veritasium youtube channel so for those of you who don't know i recently
*  appeared in a video on veritasium where derrick miller is trying to explain the many worlds
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics especially using the double slit and other and schrodinger's
*  cat and other classic experiments so the question is i saw there were some bottles on the shelves
*  have you tasted any hungarian wine i recommend you the best sweet dessert wine of the world it's
*  takaji azhuu so i have tasted takaji i'm a i'm a fan i'm not a huge fan of dessert wines i don't
*  do them very often more of a whiskey person if i'm going to have anything at all after the wine
*  drinking portion of the meal has ended but i have had it it's good i agree i'm not going to i'm not
*  going to agree that it's the best in the world because i have no opinion on that i will not take
*  sides on that issue for those of you who are wondering the bottles on the shelves in my office
*  are champagne bottles and they're all empty there's one bottle for every phd student i've had who has
*  successfully defended their thesis i think i'm up to 13 bottles right now but it might it might be
*  14 i might be losing count okay the last question is ross hastings says my question this month
*  relates to donald hoffman's fitness beats truth theorem and his claim that our perceptions of
*  objective reality including space time are a mere desktop interface hiding a fundamentally
*  different world altogether what credence would you assign to the fitness beats truth theorem
*  so i think you know i'm not that interested in this i got a lot of questions about it i don't
*  think that there's a lot interesting going on here there's a sense in which it is trivially true and
*  there's a sense in which i think it is deeply false the sense in which i think it's trivially
*  true is that of course our everyday picture of the world that we see with our eyeballs and touch with
*  our hands doesn't give us very direct access access to the true nature of reality right i think we all
*  know that if you think the true nature of reality for example is a quantum wave function obeying the
*  schrodinger equation i don't see the wave function with my eyes it's taken hundreds of years of
*  science to figure that out so we have other theories like newtonian classical physics or for that
*  matter aristotelian physics that are much more natural direct immediate models of the world
*  around us so in that sense our perceptions are much closer to aristotelian physics than they are
*  to quantum mechanics and therefore our perceptions are not giving us the entire truth i think that's
*  kind of obviously true and i'm not surprised by that but the idea that we somehow can't get to
*  the fundamental reality underneath it all or the idea that there isn't any fundamental reality or
*  the idea that we are creating a fundamental reality or the idea that different people have
*  different versions of fundamental reality or there is no fundamental reality i don't like any of those
*  ideas at all i think there is a fundamental reality i think we're getting closer and closer to it i
*  think the process by which we get closer and closer to it is called science this is what i do for a
*  living i think that you know there's a there's a school of thought which i think that hoffman is
*  sympathetic to although i don't know whether he would characterize himself this way but there's
*  been a school of thought for hundreds of years that puts mental action at the center of things
*  and physical reality as a subsidiary or secondary thing right there's different i'm being intentionally
*  vague because there's different variations on this theme but idealism and other theories that put
*  mind at the center and physical reality secondary and i am entirely on the other side of that i
*  think that physical reality comes first mind and cognition and thinking and perception and so forth
*  these are all just ways of talking about certain aspects of objective physical reality and if you
*  want more on that you can buy my book the big picture very glad that i've written all these
*  books now so i can actually tell people to go read them when these questions come up but okay
*  that's it for this month thanks very much for listening in and those of you who are here first
*  because you're not patreon supporters i hope you enjoyed it i hope you got something out of it
*  come back next month when we'll have another exciting bout of questions here on mindscape ama
*  you
