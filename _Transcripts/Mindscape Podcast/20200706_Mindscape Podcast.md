Creativity is one of those things that we all admire but struggle to define or make concrete. Music provides a useful laboratory in which to examine what creativity is all about â€” how do people become creative, what is happening in their brains during the creative process, and what kinds of creativity does the audience actually enjoy? David Rosen and Scott Miles are both neuroscientists and musicians who have been investigating this question from the perspective of both listeners and performers. They have been performing neuroscientific experiments to understand how the brain becomes creative, and founded Secret Chord Laboratories to develop software that will predict what kinds of music people will like.

David S. Rosen received his Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from Drexel University. He is currently a co-founder and the chief operations officer at Secret Chord Laboratories, a music-tech startup company. His interdisciplinary research program covers an array of topics: creative cognition, peak experiences, the neuroscience of music production and perception, psychedelics and STEAM education. David began playing the piano at the age of 8 and bass at age 15. He is the co-creator and bassist of sci-fi transmedia band, Chronicles of Sound, and instrumental progressive rock band, NAKAMA.

Scott Miles received his Ph.D. in neuroscience from Georgetown University. He is currently the CEO and innovation leader of Secret Chord Laboratories. He has been performing and producing music since the age of 10. In his doctoral work he investigated how music preference is formed in the brain. He secured funding through the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship to support this work. With David Rosen, Ph.D., he found support for two hypotheses about how the structure of music leads to purchase decisions. Miles then coded an algorithm to generate new music, and in a behavioral experiment, music featuring these properties was indeed preferred. He formed and has overseen the development of Secret Chord laboratories since it was incorporated in June 2018.

# Mindscape 104 | David Rosen and Scott Miles on the Neuroscience of Music and Creativity
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPaSqUAxF3M)
*  Hello everybody, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. And today we're going to be talking about creativity, what it means and where it comes from.
*  So I thought it would be, well it worked out anyway, that this would be a fun time to actually be creative in the format of the podcast.
*  This is one of the very rare times when we're going to have not two people on the podcast, me and somebody else, not even one person as I do in the solo podcasts,
*  but three people on the podcast, me and two other people. We've done this only once before when we had Matthew Lutzi on the program to talk about the pleasures of wine and Jennifer Willett joined us as a guest commentator there.
*  But now we're going to have two people who are experts in their field and I will be talking to them. And that field is music and creativity.
*  In some sense, creativity is mysterious for a lot of us. We know it when we see it, but we don't know how to conjure it up.
*  Music is a nice kind of laboratory to explore how creativity works, not just how we recognize creativity, but what is going on in our brains.
*  So both David Rosen and Scott Miles are neuroscientists and they are also both working musicians.
*  So they're interested in doing neuroscientific experiments to understand what's going on in your brain when you're being creative.
*  They recently published a study of jazz musicians improvising on guitar and they show that certain parts of the brain light up when you are improvising.
*  And guess what? The parts of your brain that light up are different if you are an expert jazz musician versus if you're just a beginner.
*  So that might give us a little bit of insight into where creativity is coming from. Creativity is not the same for everyone.
*  On the other side of the coin, the listener side, both David and Scott are interested in why do people like certain kinds of music rather than other kinds.
*  We like our music to be a little bit patterned, a little bit predictable, but not completely predictable, not just rote and repetitive.
*  So they are actually part of the creative team behind secret chord laboratories that is developing artificial intelligence software that will help you judge
*  whether a certain piece of music is actually going to be enjoyed by the audience before the audience even gets to hear it.
*  So there's a lot of different aspects to creativity here and we're going to talk about them in the context of music.
*  But I hope that this actually extends beyond the simple musical realm to creativity more broadly.
*  That's the kind of thing that all of us could use a little bit more of. So let's go.
*  All right. David Rosen and Scott Miles. Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Hi, Sean. Thanks for having us. It's good to be here. Let me just because I'm not used to having two people as guests. Let me help out the listeners.
*  David, why don't you say your name so we can recognize your voice going forward?
*  Sure. Hi, this is David Rosen. All right. That's David and Scott.
*  Hi, this is Scott Miles. Excellent. And let me let me take on the devil's advocate to what you folks are doing here because you're thinking about music and creativity,
*  studying it scientifically and even thinking about how we could algorithmatize, turn our notion of what constitutes good music into an algorithm.
*  Isn't there some fear that you're taking all the heart and soul out of a passionate human endeavor?
*  Well, there certainly is a fear. But I have full confidence that with the approach that we've been taking meticulously from the very beginning,
*  that we're doing everything we can to make sure that those fears aren't realized.
*  When you really look at it, what we at the heart of what we do is we look at expectations.
*  So are the principles that we go into and all the science of it is that touch and release.
*  It has to do with expectations that are developed over time.
*  That has to do with culture and culture is something that, you know, sort of as a biological necessity or evolution is something that we develop in the place where we are.
*  So it kind of helps bond us to each other and it kind of creates this helps like mold this emotional bond that we have to have to help the cohesiveness of a territory.
*  Right. And so one of the things, one of the functions of music throughout time has been to kind of give an identity to a group of people who occupy a certain territory.
*  You know, there's also, of course, symbols or, you know, you have sports teams or all these things that identify you, your accent, your customs, how you greet each other.
*  And these things are things that we learn through exposure.
*  And so what we've tried to do is to model that sort of learning that that learning is statistical.
*  And because of the just that happens to be and I think that this is actually not intentional, but it has benefited us through our evolution,
*  that the place where we kind of develop these statistical expectations through exposure is very proximal in the brain and the limbic system to our emotional centers to the parts of our brain that process reward and that process these, you know, like the dopamine and oxytocin and serotonin and these feelings of belonging togetherness.
*  And, you know, one of the functions that music has served in the past is to bond us together.
*  And we're so passionate because of this, it allows us to overcome the fear of, you know, God forbid we have to defend the territory.
*  You know, you see Braveheart and you see them painted in their faces and that sort of thing.
*  And then you go to a kiss concert, you see the same thing.
*  So you have or maybe an Eagles game, right?
*  So, so, so there's there's something about this whole like adhering to this interplay between adhering to these expectations, which is really what culture is all about.
*  And emotional, the emotional component to culture and music.
*  And really what we've just tried to do is look at that in an algorithmic way.
*  I mean, you're forming algorithms in your brain anyhow.
*  And because of artificial intelligence, we've been able to scale that and say, OK, what might an individual audience, how would how might they respond to this?
*  And, you know, maybe help the industry a little bit that way.
*  And, you know, let's face it, the industry is already using algorithms and the algorithms that they're using are not human at all.
*  We're looking at something that's a lot closer to the human experience, which is where the brain is processing the auditory signal.
*  I think that's a fascinating answer and actually very different than what I expected, which is great, because, of course, I'm not very good at playing the devil's advocate here.
*  I think that we should be trying to understand what goes on in the brain when we do these things.
*  But your emphasis on culture is really interesting.
*  So I presume that when we think about how music impacts the brain, there are universal aspects that everyone, you know, responds to things like rhythm and melody.
*  But then there's also culturally specific aspects.
*  And it sounds like you spend a lot of time separating those out or at least taking the culturally particular aspects very seriously.
*  Yeah, I think that's a really important part of this.
*  One of the things we say is neuroscience is people and expectations is culture.
*  And what I mean by that is that the brain is really what makes humans unique amongst all the species on this planet, our ability to problem solve and to think into the future and to create plans and organize and create hierarchies out of information.
*  And it's the brain data really that differentiates in terms of different analytics and predictive algorithms, the approach of Scott and I being two neuroscientists, how we think the most effective algorithms need to have that data point to be human centered.
*  Go ahead, Scott.
*  Yeah, and you're right, Sean.
*  I mean, there are I mean, there's this a little bit of you know, this is the classic debate in psychology and in neuropsychology and cognitive science that about nurture versus nature.
*  And, you know, like you like there are many scholars who say, oh, the perfect fifth, you know, in a you know, like in a you know, like the power cord, you know, in music is universal and it's every in this in every system.
*  And then you look at and and the in the literature, you see like, oh, well, you know, sad songs have minor thirds and happy songs have, you know, it's more consonant to have a major third.
*  And, you know, people prefer duple rhythm over triple rhythm.
*  But then you see there's some cultures, there was actually some work done by my colleague, Jessica, Jessica Phillips Silver, with whom I worked at Georgetown.
*  And she actually looked at babies who were they gestated in, you know, when their mother you develop a lot of your rhythmic expectations in the womb.
*  So things that seem to be universal might have to do actually with exposure to just the gate of their mother walking.
*  And so some of these things actually are environmental, despite how universal they might seem.
*  And there's some work I think it was just Joshua McDermott at at Harvard.
*  He looked and he supposedly had found a tribe of, you know, of people in in in South America somewhere who did not prefer the consonants who do do that.
*  Find like major thirds more constant than minor thirds.
*  But I actually had the opportunity over pizza one time in Cambridge to have a debate with him over this.
*  And what I what I said was like, you found a lack of results, but you didn't find opposite results.
*  It'd be much more interesting.
*  I'm not not to say that it wasn't great work, but but I would think if I were doing the study, you know, I would say, oh, but it would be more interesting if you found somebody who had the opposite effect.
*  Right. And we don't find that.
*  And so that that might mean that like you that you're right, Sean, that there are some things that are universal.
*  And what we try to do in our algorithm is we have there's a lot of layers that we build into the to the, you know, the machine learning and the artificial intelligence.
*  And it has to do with exposure.
*  And some of it is just baked into the cake that, you know, these things like major thirds or are perfect fifths are our duple rhythm.
*  Even for most cultures is something, you know, I mean, by four four instead of three four is something that is is preferred.
*  But it's it's a it's a controversy.
*  I mean, even the twelve tone scale, the chromatic scale, then the major scale, minor scale within that, those are not culturally universal.
*  Right. Other Asian cultures and African cultures don't always choose that.
*  Am I correct about that?
*  Mm hmm. You are. Yeah, actually, my my my initial PhD study idea for my dissertation was going to be to see if grown adults, you know, like undergrads could learn the different tonality and the different syntactical rules of North Indian classical music over a few exposures.
*  And see what's happening in their brain and fMRI and functional magnetic resonance imaging as these rules were being learned.
*  And there's some foundation from for that from an artificial musical system.
*  It's called Boland Pierce, which is kind of to me, it's kind of crazy, but it's it's weird sounding.
*  It's from the 60s. It's experimental.
*  I think it's like breaks the octave into 13 tones instead of 12.
*  Oh, my God. And so what we wanted to do with that work, and it kind of goes into what our whole idea going into secret chord is that we wanted to do something that's more applicable and more, you know, more generalizable to what people are actually doing in their everyday life.
*  Cool. So I think I think, you know, my I have a million questions, so I'm hesitating.
*  And therefore, I think what I really should do is back up a little bit.
*  I mean, let's let's this is exciting stuff. So let's lay some of the groundwork for how we're thinking about these.
*  And let me just go back to the most basic question. I mean, how do you to define music? What is music?
*  What is it? Why do we all throughout every culture care about it?
*  Which I guess begs the question, are there cultures that don't have music at all?
*  Yes, that's actually one of the sticking points in the study about the the consonant third.
*  That culture didn't seem to have music in any sort of significant way.
*  Well, so, you know, that's why I was that was my counterpoint in the pizza discussion was like, it'd be interesting if they had a completely different kind of music, but it's just an absence of music.
*  But really, you know, we find in one of the famous landmark studies that we kind of base a lot of our research on out of Robert Satori's lab in McGill University of Montreal was the lead author on that was Valerie Salem-Pore.
*  And she starts off the paper in her science paper in this experiment.
*  It was an empirical experiment. But to start the literature review, she brings up that there was a flute discovered from I believe it was 10,000 years ago in Germany made out of bone.
*  And so at the very dawn of really what we consider, you know, any kind of human species that we would recognize as far as civilization, there was already music.
*  And what is the definition? Maybe we'll give this one to David.
*  Like, how would you define what music is?
*  I would say music to nonverbal form of of communication that involves a series of different can be broken down into a series of different features and aspects.
*  And, you know, music can have any or any of these aspects can have a few of these aspects dynamics, I think is important part and melody, melodic.
*  So in terms of the movement and pitch of notes, now that shifts, I think rhythm is an important aspect of that.
*  I mean, rhythm doesn't just show up in music, of course, we have rhythm to our speech as well.
*  I think that the texture of the sounds is a critical piece and that goes right hand in hand kind of with with the timbre, which again, we see a lot of overlap in terms of this.
*  That's why I think the nonverbal communication, I wouldn't say that not a language, though, because, you know, clearly there's there's linguistic components in music as well.
*  I think, I think that's those are some of the core components of it.
*  I know that's a clear definition or operationalized Navy Scott can give that and more of an operational definition a shot.
*  Well, it was interesting. I don't know if it must have been something tells me it might have been a drummer.
*  But there was a reductionist kind of definition of music that he said everything when it comes down to it is just rhythm.
*  Because if you play something fast enough, it becomes you know, if you play a beat 440 times every second, it becomes middle A, you know, so or high A on a piano.
*  So and then, you know, you play overtones over that and then it becomes a timbre.
*  And then, you know, the one thing that you left out there, I think, was was harmony, which is interesting as an interesting omission.
*  Because when I looked at the North Indian classical music, they have no notion of harmony.
*  It's almost exclusively monotonic music. So, you know, at least the music that I encountered.
*  I remember hearing somewhere this claim that that sort of more primitive what we would call primitive music, ancient music, but also music from other cultures that we Western centric people might not grow up with is has actually much more sophisticated rhythmic structure than Western classical music does.
*  So when Western classical music discovered polyphony and harmony and so forth, their rhythmic capabilities atrophied a little bit.
*  And it's more work these days to actually rediscover that heritage.
*  Well, David Byrne is an interesting academic source there.
*  I mean, he's he's good friends, you know, from the talking heads. He's good friends with with someone who's actually advised us along the way.
*  Daniel Levinson, who's also at McGill, who's, you know, probably the scholar to ask these sort of questions, the foundational questions of, you know, why we have music and that sort of thing.
*  He's expounded upon that book upon book. But in David Byrne's book, How Music Works, he said he the first chapter of the first couple chapters is all about environment.
*  He talked about CBG bees and how that that the structure, the architecture and the wall hangings and everything just shaped the sound of the talking heads early on.
*  He talked about how Mozart and the Protestant Reformation, why that started, you know, you had more intricate sounds when you had droning sounds in the cathedrals because they would resonate through the walls.
*  And he talks about Africa and South America.
*  And then when you're outside, what's going to travel far is going to be rhythm.
*  You know, it's going to be the bass, the lower notes and the frequency.
*  And I don't know if that accounts for any of the phenomenon that you're bringing up, Sean, but it's something to think about.
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. OK, so speaking of rhythm, I mean, one of the things that you've done research on is the importance of surprise or the role of surprise, let's say, in how much we like music.
*  Like if all we had was a rhythm that repeated itself in a very basic way over and over again, we would get bored pretty quickly.
*  Whereas if all we had was either rhythm or or melody, for that matter, that was completely random and unstructured, we would be repulsed.
*  There's some happy medium there.
*  And I know that you've been interested in studying the extent to which a little bit of familiarity and a little bit of surprise plays an important role in how much we like a piece of music.
*  Yeah, so we definitely are looking at expectations being violated and surprise.
*  And there's these two aspects, right? There's there's the familiar.
*  There's the familiar and the surprising. And there's kind of been work done on both on both of these topics.
*  But what we really find interesting and what we found through our research is that when you have this right balance of familiarity and surprise,
*  that's when you see the optimal level of enjoyment and dopamine and really pleasure.
*  And where we see this and why this is occurring, the mechanisms in the brain is really because of our two memory systems.
*  We have an explicit memory system that is constantly learning.
*  It's a conscious system. It's our it's if we relate it to like a language model, it's it's declarative.
*  In terms of memory system, it's declarative. We can recall it.
*  It's when we've heard a song over and over and over again and we can we can sing along with it.
*  Right. And we're familiar with that.
*  But as you're saying, if we hear the same rhythm repeating over and over and over again, that's not going to be pleasing.
*  And it's our it's our other system in the human brain that responds.
*  We've seen through a number of studies like from Anipatel of the implicit system responding to surprises, to chords and to melodies that are unexpected.
*  And basically when when the memory when both memory systems, when music is occurring and both memory systems at the same time are being hijacked by the musical stimulus around us,
*  that's when we see that dopamine response and when people are really preferring and finding their favorite types of music.
*  Yeah, so it seems so like a lot of things when you look at a person, they look like a single person.
*  But when you study neuroscience, you realize that these different systems at play and Amos Dversky famously won the Nobel Prize for for their work,
*  Kahneman and Dversky for economics for looking at system one, system two.
*  And and my mentor at Georgetown looked at this with language, with procedural memory and declarative memory.
*  Well, I think you should probably explain more with system one system to our because I'm sure it's kind of.
*  Yeah, yeah. So it's kind of like what Dave was was talking about before.
*  So your system system one is the more implicit, the more like rules, things that, you know, like if you just if you drive home and you forget that you drove home because it's something that you've done over and over and over again.
*  And it's something that's kind of like automatized in your brain.
*  But then all of a sudden, if you're driving and then and then you, you know, you realize, oh, I was supposed to go to the I was supposed to go to the dentist and pick up my kid on the way home.
*  Then that's kind of more a system to kind of explicit.
*  And a lot of days early work, his PhD work had to do with these two systems and jazz improvisation.
*  Scott has a great story, Scott.
*  Scott has a great story about seeing Michael Jordan in 1992 that I think really clearly articulates the differences between system one and system two.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, I think that, yeah, so I'm not a big sports guy, you know, and so even though I made I led with the Eagles reference, I pretty when I think of the Eagles, I'm more I'm more likely to think of Don Henley and Glenn Fry.
*  But yeah, so, you know, whenever I go to a sports game, I'm like, which one's the bass player, you know, and so but then I went to see because, you know, I was dating this girl and she had tickets to see the Bulls and the Bullets in 1992.
*  So it's like the dream team or or whatever it is that, you know, the Chicago Bulls in the early 90s.
*  Yeah. And, you know, I went there and I'd never been to a professional sports game before.
*  And I'm sitting there. I'm just trying to, you know, get some popcorn or whatever, like, you know, like hang out with my girlfriend and her father.
*  And I look out there and I'm like, wait a minute.
*  One of these guys, there's like 10 guys out there running around then like and nine of them are, you know, doing what I've seen on TV or whatever, you know, I've seen in the playground and all that stuff.
*  And then this other guy is is performing ballet.
*  Right. And that was Michael Jordan.
*  And I was like, yeah, there was this emergent property of like the way he was moving through the through the court that was just qualitatively distinct to me.
*  And I had no idea anything about basketball. But, you know, I knew that that must have been the guy.
*  Right. So, OK, sorry. So tell us how this explains system one system, too.
*  Sure. So I can dig into that. So because because in Scott's situation, he really lacked the system, too, would be the system that's focused on more explicit control.
*  And conscious knowledge in terms of neuroscience, we think of that as the executive control network if we're talking about brain systems.
*  And if I'm a fan of sports and basketball, I know all about how many championships Michael Jordan has won.
*  I know about the slam dunk contest of what he's won. I know where he went to college.
*  I follow him. I have his jersey. Right. All these different reminders that have built up that my knowledge set of Michael Jordan.
*  Right. And let's say I know and I'm a huge Michael Jordan fan because of this, of all the all these stats that are true, explicit knowledge with the fact that when Scott is watching it, he's really having a more system one dominant experience of watching Michael Jordan because he doesn't have all of that meta information.
*  He's responding to his to his movement and his his visual, the visual stimulus that he's having at that game, probably also with some cheers around and with some auditory stimuli as well.
*  But that's more of an implicit bottom up type of processing. It affects like the dorsal stream.
*  And in terms of neuroscientific systems, we think more along the lines of the default mode network.
*  To wrap it to wrap up the reason that people when they see that those two things in concert are working what it seems to be that they're working against each other.
*  But what you really want is you want something that's very familiar explicitly, but very surprising implicitly.
*  And it makes sense to me to think that it's like dopamine is a learning molecule.
*  So if you know something, it's like if you're watching a movie like I think it's safe to say usual suspects, you know, if nobody's seen it, spoiler alert, you know.
*  So once you get to the end, if you're watching that movie with a friend of yours and he hasn't or she hasn't seen it before, when you get to the end, you know explicitly that there's a twist there.
*  But you actually enjoy it even more because you're smarter than your friend and your dopamine is kind of going off and saying, you know, something, you know, and it tricks you into thinking that you've actually done work and that you're more evolutionarily adapted to your environment.
*  And if you if there's nothing there, like you said, Sean, if it's just going on and on and on, if it's just like nobody, they never find cars or so say, and that's just the regular plot and there's no twist.
*  There's nothing to learn. There's nothing for you to know. And conversely, if you don't know, then you're there's nothing for you to be smart about. You know, you're not smart about the thing that is there.
*  So it's this that's the reason that you want new artists, but then you want to play the grooves out and spin them on the rec on the radio or streaming because you want to have that fresh sound, but you want everybody to hear it over and over and over again.
*  And it seems like those two things are diametrically opposed. But the missing premise is they're two different brain systems. And that's what we're seeking to, you know, that's what kind of our laboratory work is seeking to prove.
*  There's a joke here in Hollywood. When you go to pitch your TV show to a network, the network will always say, give us exactly what's already successful and on the air, but completely different.
*  And maybe you're explaining that. I mean, maybe this is not just hypocrisy. Maybe that there is this once you once you understand the dual process notion of how the brain works, there's a in at one system you want to be exactly what people know and another system you want to be surprising.
*  Well, don't don't they ask you for a meets like you have to say it's Alf meets terms of endearment.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, that would be a great movie, by the way, I think.
*  I mean, I wonder how, how formal we can be about, about extending this analysis to things like movies or novels or something like that, because, you know, in some sense, music is a nice simple test case.
*  You know, songs are short, there's a finite number of instruments, etc. We can analyze the notes, but but maybe this is a more general theory of how we respond to art, maybe even visual art as well.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think it definitely applies. I think your inclination is correct. Sean, we talk about this all the time about narratives just and story. I'm a big guy like sci fi and fantasy nerd and I was compared to like an epic trilogy.
*  Right. And it's, it's like the same thing. This is the second, like the second act, right, you're building attention, you're building attention, you end on a down moment. And then that's the tension similar to a musical moment you have that release of a huge epic battle in the third book.
*  And like, you know, and that's, you know, that's the that that that release and that's where the pleasure really kicks off is that those those points between that the push and pull of those stressors and then releasing it, which I think ultimately is rooted in, you know, in in our evolution, in which we experience
*  But they have through that. But the practical part of that, Sean, is I think you you kind of put your finger on it is that with we have seven features that we look at in music, and it's very music is, you know, lends itself to being analyzed quantitatively, you know, and because the spotifies and the Pandora's and the academics of the world, look at features for other reasons, you know, for song similarity and recommendations, we piggyback on a lot of that work. But when you're talking about, you know, just like if you, if you, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you're talking about, you
*  know, if you're talking about a movie that's going to reduce one frame of a 24 frames, second frames per second movie that's in 4k, you're talking about 8 million pixels. Yeah, right times 24 frames. And then you have all the different qualities. And then you have like, how do you generalize and make fuzzy boundaries around it? And it gets a little complex, but I mean, that there's always, you know, work on the horizon to be done.
*  Well, no one ever said the complete scientific theory of the success of art was going to be easy. So I'm glad that we're starting with a lot of energy here.
*  My mentor actually started my mentor that I finished out the PhD with is works with Renaissance paintings and that sort of thing with the visual neuroscience system. He worked with Thomas Poggio, a famous visionary in in vision at MIT.
*  And so and he's actually worked in neuro aesthetics with that Norberto Grubich. So, you know, there's but there's a relationship here reminds me of work that was done trying to claim that abstract expressionist paintings like Jackson Pollock were in part successful because they were scale free.
*  That is to say that there were things going on on very tiny scales and things going on medium scales and things going on scales. They were fractals. Yeah, it was debunked a little bit because the methodology was not that great. But there's clearly something to it. And I wonder how that also goes into the music thing.
*  You know, surprise is one. Yeah, surprise is one aspect. But also this complexity is another aspect. Right. Exactly. And I would also argue that there's familiarity in the fact that you know, it's a Jackson Pollock. Like if somebody gave you the same painting and said their kid did it, then, you know,
*  Well, I think that the hope was that, yeah, we've all had this this reaction, you know, yeah, I could do that. My kid could do that. But the idea was that in the paintings that had become historically very successful in abstract expressionism, there was something that was not in what your six year old does. It really was a quantitative difference. But I think it turns out to be hard to measure that. But do you think you think of something like that? I mean, have you studied whether something like that is also true in music that it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a, you know, it's not just a,
*  you know, the surprise aspect, but multi scale aspect? Is that an important thing to people enjoying things?
*  Yeah, I think that's I think this is expectation violation and surprise is really been at the heart of what we do, but it's a small piece of really the greater phenomenon of how music moves humans on a greater scale.
*  One of the other things we've talked about from work from Carol Crum Hansel is called
*  cascading reminiscence bumps.
*  And that has to do with the influence and seeing how music kind of comes, popular music
*  especially comes back every 20 or 25 years or so.
*  You see the 70s creeping back and the other 90s and then you see the 80s that come back.
*  And these are cycles because of when we're younger, really the music around us is not
*  self-selected.
*  This is during that critical period where our implicit systems, those unconscious responses
*  to kind of the statistical regularities and characteristics of music are developed.
*  And that's really based on the decisions of the music our parents and our family, our
*  family members choose.
*  And then so that kind of sets this implicit standard and also from which the next generation
*  of music comes from, then the listeners who were growing up, they're ready for kind of
*  this certain amount of expectation, violation and surprise.
*  And I think that's really interesting to think about because when those huge identity
*  moments of the teenage years, those years when you're really forming your social bonds
*  and relationships, I think that's where we started with talking about the power of music
*  and how it's so important there.
*  It's interesting that in terms of popular music, you really see the 13 to 19 or 20 year
*  olds, they're the ones who are consuming and who are targeted the most popular music.
*  And it may be that and we see this consistent trend of those top songs having these patterns
*  of expectation, violation and surprise because they're kind of at a set point of, you know,
*  they've learned kind of the rules and what's going on around them in the universe.
*  Now they're ready to take that to the next step.
*  And we see these kind of cyclical patterns over decades.
*  And to tie in the cyclical patterns to your previous point, Sean, about the Jackson Pollock
*  and the different levels of complexity.
*  I think that it's important even in our work, even if we do look at surprise and we're
*  doing it looking at the same seven features that you take into account that some of the
*  features can be looked at not just as the kind of the dependent variables, but kind
*  of to be looked at to say, OK, these the values that we find for these parameters,
*  whether it be rhythm or whether it be the year of release or whatever it is, certain
*  timbers, they can actually set the stage and say, OK, it's not a linear effect.
*  So it could say this is the condition upon which we say, OK, this is now what we're this
*  the paradigm that we're looking at and almost shifts to a different thing that wouldn't
*  be expected because of things like, oh, well, their parents were listening to this music.
*  We've got to incorporate that in the algorithm or like look, I mean, there's there's
*  certain levels of complexity. When you brought up the Jackson Pollock, it makes me think of
*  John Coltrane. You know, I'm a big jazz fan.
*  I know my last name is Miles.
*  I named my son Coltrane Coltrane Miles.
*  And so, so, you know, giant steps, you know, I've seen I don't know if this is real or
*  academically rigorous, but I kind of hear it myself.
*  I don't know if it's just, you know, wishful thinking.
*  But I hear sort of fractal patterns in that in that composition, giant steps.
*  And it's almost like he's composing the composition around the composition, you know,
*  and it's like it turns into this kind of fractal sort of like, I don't know, I don't
*  know how much rigor, mathematical rigor this would withstand.
*  Like you said, just the same thing as Jackson Pollock.
*  But that kind of thing is not something that linearly follows from a pop song.
*  You know, like you have to go to a completely different paradigm and say, OK, Coltrane
*  fans are listening for something completely different.
*  You know, they are ready for something else.
*  They're not going to, you know, skip after 30 seconds if there's not a hook, you know.
*  And so you're looking for you kind of have to shift your your expectations and making
*  the prediction. Well, it's really interesting how there are these universal aspects, but
*  they play out differently in different people depending on their culture, their training,
*  their interests, etc. But, you know, speaking of that, Colt, the, you know, Mindscape
*  listeners are the Coltrane fans of the podcast world.
*  So we went a little bit.
*  We're ready for a little bit more depth here.
*  And I really wanted you to explain a little bit how you measure the surprisingness
*  of a pop song or any piece of music, because I know information theory is involved.
*  I know we have a wonderful podcast with Carl Friston, who has a theory about how the
*  brain works that is deeply embedded in information theory.
*  So that would be a great connection.
*  Yeah, that was a great that was a great session.
*  I really got a lot out of that.
*  It was it was he's singing our tune.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So, yeah, the calculations basically.
*  So we start off like, you know, talk about giant steps.
*  We start off in baby steps. Right.
*  Yep. So we basically looked at zero order.
*  So in other words, zero order harmony is what the dissertation work was on when I was at
*  Georgetown when I started working with Dave as a research partner.
*  So we basically looked at a few hundred, like six hundred songs, all on a major key,
*  all from Johnny B.
*  Good to Smells Like Teen Spirit, 1958 to 1991.
*  You know, a little sampling.
*  Yeah. So of of the Billboard charts.
*  And it was transcriptions that were that were done by a PhD student at McGill,
*  Ashley Burgoyne. And so basically we had all the pieces
*  together to kind of work from and the theory, which was developed by Leonard Meier in
*  1956 and 57, which is that information theory has something to do with
*  meaningfulness. He didn't necessarily talk about preference, but we kind of like, you
*  know, morphed it into our measure of like Billboard charting success, which has its
*  own confounds. And everybody always has a complaint about that.
*  But the more we go to direct, you know, behavioral studies and, you know, with
*  with actual participants, then you can you can you can stop worrying about the confounds
*  of the Billboard methodology.
*  So but that's what we had. And so basically we looked at the top quartile, which is
*  mainly number one, maybe some number two songs because of the long tail of popular
*  music. And then the bottom quartile, which is like number 50, 60, whatever, down to
*  100. And so what we did was we we would take using the Shannon entropy,
*  Shannon calculation from 1958, I believe, of Claude Shannon and his way of
*  computing complexity or entropy or information in anything that's
*  mathematically or anything that's really classified into different groups and that
*  you have a whole corpus of it. So we had the corpus, which was the 600 songs that
*  translated about 30,000 chords.
*  And we took those chords and we cut them off at a seventh, you know, so the seventh
*  and a ninth and a 13th was pretty much the same.
*  You know, we figure, you know, the ear doesn't really discriminate that much.
*  And, you know, what I've learned from my, you know, my jazz teachers, you can always
*  turn a seventh into a ninth if you want.
*  So so depending on how jazzy you want to be.
*  Right. So so that was kind of we cut them off at a seventh.
*  So basically there was about, you know, five or six hundred different types of chords
*  all in one key. So we normalized everything to like a C major or whatever it is,
*  whatever the one. So we're differentiated between different keys.
*  So it was mainly a matter of the function of the key and then the color of the of
*  the of the function of the chord and the color of the chord.
*  And then we would take. OK, so let's say it's like one major like C major and C.
*  And so that was the most common.
*  I think you would probably guess if you know anything about music and popular music,
*  that was the most common out of the 30,000 chords that are in all these songs.
*  Right. I mean, you know, not just each unique chord, but every time there's a chord
*  and all the songs, we put it all together and we would say, OK, maybe there's like
*  five thousand times that there's a C major.
*  If I break all the songs in a quarter notes and I take five thousand divided by
*  sixty or thirty thousand, you get that number.
*  You take it's a fraction. You take the negative log base two of it.
*  And so you get what you get is you get a number in bits of how
*  surprising that chord is. So that chord is not very surprising at all.
*  It's low around one or two bits.
*  And so our range was like between like one or two bits to like six bits, seven bits.
*  You know, like if there's like a F sharp minor ninth or seventh, whatever,
*  that would be, you know, seven bits. Right.
*  So if it only showed up once out of 30,000 chords. Right.
*  So that gave us kind of a manageable scale to work with where we could see,
*  you know, by taking the log and, you know, Claude Shannon obviously came up with that method.
*  And so that gave us a way of saying in bits, how much information is there from each one of these chords?
*  Now, if you know anything about music theory, you might be listening to this method and saying,
*  that's ridiculous.
*  Like if I hear a C major chord in the middle of something, like it might be very surprising.
*  I don't care what, you know, but we were basically just looking at zero with order and that's it.
*  So it's very dumb.
*  The algorithm itself is dumb.
*  Like it doesn't know what came before it, what came after it, what context it's in.
*  It just knows what key it's in and how often it happens.
*  And we just basically look there and surprisingly, we, you know, we found something.
*  What we were able to find was that the first finding was that there was absolute surprise,
*  that was higher, just barely like a half a bit higher in the top quartile songs than the bottom quartile songs.
*  And that was consistent across the whole song.
*  So no matter where we looked in the song, but we weren't lining them up in sections.
*  Right. So then we kind of came up with, uh,
*  Just to clarify, cause I mean, that was a great explanation, but there's a lot there.
*  Let me just repeat it in my own words.
*  So you're saying that the most popular songs were ones in which you were slightly more likely to hear a chord that was slightly less popular than in the less popular songs.
*  That's, that's exactly correct.
*  Yes.
*  Okay. That's an interesting finding.
*  But now, but then, then there's also within the song you're getting into.
*  Right. So in order to do that, so Dave and I came up with the idea that we're going to look and line up the choruses and the verses.
*  And so, um, so it took some convincing because I was dealing with someone who was used to looking at paintings and visual, that sort of thing.
*  And didn't know a lot about, you know, wasn't an expert in the musical field, but Dave and I were pretty,
*  pretty sure that that had to be something to do with like pre-choruses and choruses, you know?
*  And so like, if you know anything about like Max Martin, who's like, you know, behind the writer behind and producer behind the, you know, the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears all the way up to Taylor Swift.
*  And so he, you know, he always has these like really massively tense, you know, pre-choruses and then boom drops the chorus right in your face.
*  And then, you know, and, and he, he lives in a wonderful, like amazing mansion and East Hollywood.
*  So in West Hollywood, sorry. So, um, um, so we visited it when we were out there. So I just wanted to see it. So, so yeah, so I mean, um, you know, it works, right?
*  So we were trying to see, okay, is this something that just works for him or is this something that you can actually empirically show is a correlation?
*  And what we do is we lined up, you know, we basically just took, uh, thankfully, um, uh, actually as part of his, of his dissertation, he had the notation, the, the, the transcribers that he used actually say what they thought was the chorus and the verse and that sort of thing.
*  So we looked for all the verses that came right before a chorus. And sure enough, there was higher surprise.
*  This, this surprise effect that you found over the whole song was it being accounted for almost entirely by the parts before the, the choruses.
*  It's, it was like the bridges, obviously, but bridges came before choruses too.
*  So it was really something that looked like it was across the whole song, but it was because we were agnostic to where in the song, you know, obviously different songs would have different places.
*  We were just using like each song as one and we were just saying like halfway through the song, you know, whatever, it's still, you know, a quarter way through the song.
*  And it just happened to be that all these were kind of, you know, distributing themselves across all the songs, across a hundred songs, 500 songs.
*  So we have expectations for certain kinds of chords in general, but also at particular points in the song, we have expectations for what's going to happen next.
*  And that just tweaking that expectation a little bit helps us make a hit single.
*  Yeah, well, it definitely, it definitely helps to, I mean, using, using those expectations, it helps in terms of how much of, of let's say commercial success is being driven by these expectations and surprise.
*  And that's a question that we ask ourselves, that we ask ourselves every day.
*  But I think it speaks also to, to the common structure of, of popular music and how that's something when, you know, people who are not musicians or musicologists are familiar with that, with the sing along, you know, the chorus and then the more kind of the more wordy verses with more kind of.
*  That's another thing that we kind of like talk about is, you know, how does, how do rhythmic patterns of, of words in music often have a different meaning?
*  So I think that again speaks to kind of the explicit system and knowledge and know how of how these pieces of the song work.
*  But then also when we look before and after these key transition points is where we see these these these large transition points and changes in those in those surprise moments.
*  Yeah. And what was it? What was fascinating to me is, you know, the chorus is the part everybody knows it has the name of the song and it usually it's the loudest part, you know, it's the hookiest part, but at least by the metric we were looking at, and that's a big qualification harmonic surprise, at least by that difference.
*  There was no difference whatsoever.
*  Like the the courses looked identical in the in the the bottom quartile songs and the top and the number one songs, they looked identical.
*  So what I try to say was it's almost like when you go on vacation, you know, if Dave and I have gone vacation and we go to the same place or whatever, we go to the Blue Ridge Mountains for a weekend and Dave worked all week.
*  You know, I'm going to make up a crazy, like unrealistic situation.
*  If Dave worked harder all week and I didn't do any work, I don't know that would ever happen.
*  But, you know, he would enjoy, let's say he would enjoy the vacation more because it's more of a it's the same vacation.
*  It's the same course. You know, it's like my dad says, he says the joke.
*  I told him about this finding. He says, oh, it's like the guy who they asked him, why are you beating your head against the wall?
*  He says, because it feels so great when I stop, you know.
*  Yeah, that has to do with an actual physiological thing, which is you build up these opioids in your brain that are responding to the pain.
*  And that core that that verse can actually it's been shown that that actually causes this minor painful reaction in your brain.
*  Well, this is what I was wondering about, because you can say that a little bit of surprise is good.
*  And that's probably clearly true, because, like we say, we don't want to just do the same thing over and over again.
*  But maybe not all surprises are created equal. Right.
*  Like I said, are there hidden variables here?
*  Are there other dimensions along which we say, oh, this kind of surprise makes a song especially compelling, whereas this one would just be annoying to us?
*  Sure. So that's again, something we think about and look at quantitatively in our analyses.
*  And so far, we've been speaking about harmonic surprise.
*  There's also surprise in other aspects of the music.
*  There's in terms of the rhythm or the melody or the dynamics.
*  But I think we can really understand the dynamics of the music.
*  And ultimately, that if we think about the x axis as complexity, we can imagine that any single person could have that inverted U shifted along that axis based on the
*  If we go back to kind of the fan of avant-garde free jazz, you can imagine what their set of expectations are and how and where on the complexity axis they fall is going to vary based on by the individual.
*  Yeah. So I think a key factor, because in that example, we say, okay, avant-garde jazz, I'm ready to say that.
*  I'm ready to lock into a 30 minute improvisation with very little noticeable structure and even harmonies that seem like they don't really make sense and unclear, you know, chords, chord structure.
*  But that's like, that's it is like having that context and knowing and waiting for this.
*  I'm a huge improvisation guy.
*  That's where like my side of the work comes on as a fan of music improvisation and an improviser for 20 years in different bands.
*  And like for me, I live for the moment that's 15, 20 minutes in where you find this unique musical place where maybe you even trudge through some, you know, some of the things that you can do in your life.
*  And really sink into this new place that you reached, which you wouldn't have gotten to if not for dealing with those kinds of those moments that maybe weren't as important as you would have gotten to.
*  And I think that's where I live.
*  I live for the moment.
*  I live for the moment.

*  I was using jazz improvisation
*  as one form of musical creativity.
*  as one form of musical creativity.
*  as one form of musical creativity.
*  And what happens in the brain when people
*  are generating, whether it's an improvised solo
*  or they're recording multiple takes
*  or they're recording multiple takes
*  for a vocal take for a chorus.
*  Luckily, I was able to look at this intersection.
*  Luckily, I was able to look at this intersection.
*  I was at Drexel University,
*  so I was kind of looking at two really great advisors over there.
*  John Cunoz of the Creativity Research Lab
*  who had done decades of work on insight
*  who had done decades of work on insight
*  and eureka moments in creativity.
*  and eureka moments in creativity.
*  He was my psychology advisor,
*  and then I had an engineering,
*  music information retrieval professor,
*  Youngmoo Kim at an entertainment technology lab.
*  Youngmoo Kim at an entertainment technology lab.
*  And in that lab, he was an MIT graduate
*  and came from the media lab.
*  And when I started grad school,
*  he had a lab of engineers,
*  and they were basically like a feeder
*  for places like Spotify and Pandora and Graysknoe.
*  for places like Spotify and Pandora and Graysknoe.
*  And he saw the importance
*  about 10 years ago of
*  not just looking at the engineering side,
*  but really bringing in
*  someone with a music psychology
*  background in cognitive neuroscience.
*  because by leveraging
*  both of these kinds of tools,
*  we could have
*  a rigorous investigation
*  of what's happening in the music
*  and what's happening in the brain
*  as people are being creative.
*  And so through my work,
*  I did a series of studies
*  that looked at
*  both jazz pianists and jazz guitarists
*  in correlational and causational
*  studies
*  that showed
*  really distinct brain patterns
*  between experts and novices
*  and also looking at
*  how the phenomenon of
*  a psychological phenomenon of flow
*  or like being in the zone
*  can also impact
*  creative performance.
*  And that's been really the topic of
*  my work for the last several years.
*  So do we know the answer?
*  Sure.
*  I can give you
*  the abbreviated
*  version and then we can
*  dig in.
*  There's two main
*  differences that we've found
*  through these different studies.
*  First, as musicians
*  gain expertise,
*  what we see is
*  when they're performing,
*  we see prefrontal
*  activity deactivating.
*  We call this
*  hypofrontality.
*  And this idea with prefrontal activity
*  is associated with
*  conscious, controlled
*  thinking.
*  Jazz improvisation happens
*  and improvisation I think generally
*  is a really interesting topic
*  to study creativity
*  and lens to study creativity through
*  because
*  when we talk about creativity,
*  I mean it's a really hard thing to define.
*  Most people
*  will agree that it has to do with
*  novelty and appropriateness
*  in a given context.
*  But expertise
*  and also
*  the type of creativity is really
*  going to come into play.
*  So there's the creativity
*  of a small child
*  finger painting
*  for the first time.
*  And then there's the creativity of
*  Einstein.
*  We're talking about all kinds of different
*  scales.
*  So when we're talking about what does it mean to be a
*  creativity, it really
*  depends on that definition.
*  In our studies, what we did was
*  we looked at
*  creativity with two different lenses.
*  And based on how you categorize
*  creativity, you'll have slightly different results.
*  So in these studies
*  one component was
*  we had jazz musicians come into the study
*  and they would perform a number
*  of jazz solos over
*  backing track accompaniment.
*  They would be randomized
*  and sent out to some jazz professors
*  and jazz experienced jazz players.
*  A number of them would rate them on a series
*  of different metrics.
*  One of which was creativity.
*  Another was technical proficiency.
*  So when you look at the scale of
*  jazz, it's not just
*  the scale of the field.
*  As you can imagine in a highly technical domain
*  like jazz, there's lots of overlap
*  between those scales.
*  So we average them into a composite
*  quality score.
*  So through these studies
*  we see is that
*  when experts are performing
*  different novices,
*  they're more experienced, they have a more robust
*  set of explicit knowledge
*  and they're more experienced.
*  So in jazz, it's the same approach.
*  It's the same idea here.
*  It's that through rigorous
*  training,
*  years and years of explicit practice
*  we're able to develop these
*  implicit, unconscious
*  systems that are able to
*  perform extremely well
*  in these highly cognitive
*  demanding tasks.
*  That's kind of why jazz improvisation
*  is a really interesting creative task
*  because in a lot of creative tasks
*  you have these very distinct
*  phases of the creative process.
*  So if I was to, this is like
*  in terms of talking about whether it's music or another
*  topic, composition versus improvisation
*  for example is there's this ideation
*  phase
*  generating lots of different ideas.
*  This is related to one aspect
*  of creative thinking which is divergent thinking
*  which is kind of the most
*  tested area of creative thought
*  in terms of standardized assessments is
*  how many different uses can you think of
*  for a brick or a given object.
*  That's kind of like
*  when you're trying to come up with a new
*  part for a song, that's that ideation
*  phase in composition.
*  But really the ideation phase and then
*  the next piece is evaluation
*  and ultimately modification in
*  many domains in terms of that
*  cycle of the creative process.
*  That's more evaluative.
*  And what happens
*  is you're modifying,
*  you're making edits and you're tweaking
*  and then you kind of maybe go back to the ideation phase
*  and you go through this process, it's iterative.
*  With improvisation
*  you get one shot and it's all happening.
*  There's no time for any of that, yeah.
*  It's all happening in real time.
*  Sometimes as fast as 240
*  plus beats per minute
*  with chords changing perhaps
*  every quarter note or every half note.
*  And so
*  it's amazing
*  in which
*  some of the greatest jazz musicians
*  say things like, like
*  Miles Davis' famous quote, I'll play and I'll tell you
*  what it is later.
*  It seems like it's amazing
*  these eminent performers
*  these kind of anecdotal responses
*  show that they're actually letting go.
*  They're releasing that
*  cognitive control to be in
*  more of a
*  state, which I think
*  they're familiar with the state also in
*  terms of being that experience in
*  terms of getting there and are able to enter that state
*  more easily of relaxing
*  and performing kind of
*  in that bottom up sensory kind of way.
*  Yeah, I wouldn't venture
*  to compare myself to Miles Davis
*  even though we share the Miles part
*  of the name, but Dave and I
*  had a presentation that we worked really
*  really really super hard on.
*  And we kind of did this kind of like surprising
*  thing because we're kind of doing this meta
*  demonstration of the surprise effect
*  of the music.
*  And when we finally
*  did the presentation, which was
*  in Nashville at the
*  BMI building in front of a bunch of
*  industry executives
*  music industry executives
*  it was about six minutes long
*  and so there was a musical part
*  of it and we get to the break
*  the musical break, you know, like after the first
*  verse that is the chorus and like the second
*  verse starts and I had the feeling
*  I don't know if you know Sean, like when
*  you wake up when you're on
*  a mission somewhere and you're jet lagged and you just wake
*  up and you don't know where you are
*  all the time. Yeah. So that's how
*  I felt but I was on stage in
*  the middle of the performance and I was
*  highly engaged in the it was
*  you know, it was like I was carrying the performance
*  and I felt like I was waking
*  up. I didn't remember anything
*  that happened before and we were like three minutes
*  into the performance. Right. And I think
*  that, you know, so I mean, help
*  me get it straight here. So is this saying that
*  if you're not an expert
*  if you have not practiced as much, if you're just
*  an amateur, you're just learning
*  improvisation
*  maybe creativity more generally, but at least
*  improvisation is more of a
*  system two thing because you're thinking it, you're
*  overthinking it or you're, you know, you're trying to control
*  it very much and then through
*  training it becomes a system
*  one thing. It becomes subconscious. Yeah, tell them about the John
*  McEnroe thing. Sure. Yeah, I think that's
*  a pretty good assessment in terms of
*  novices in a domain. I think
*  that we were queuing each other's
*  stories today. The John McEnroe
*  I'm showing
*  my age a little bit. He's a he was a
*  tennis player, really famous in the
*  in the 80s. He was very
*  very charismatic to say the least
*  screaming obscenities often
*  on the tennis court, which is, you know,
*  which was very
*  interesting to say the least
*  at that time.
*  But there was a match, I believe it was
*  during Wimbledon and
*  he was getting beaten by
*  this underdog opponent. He was John
*  McEnroe, was the top ranked player in the world
*  at that time. And in the first
*  set, he was getting beat and
*  this player, he couldn't return his forehand.
*  He just couldn't hit it back.
*  And so after sets in tennis,
*  players will switch sides of the
*  court that they're occupying. And as
*  they switch sides, John
*  McEnroe whispered his opponent's
*  ear, what are you doing today with your forehand?
*  There's something that's going on
*  that I just can't hit it back. You've really been working
*  on that. And then after that set,
*  after that set happened
*  and those words were exchanged,
*  John McEnroe beat him in straight sets.
*  And the idea there
*  being that, you know,
*  in tennis, similar to
*  music, it's very much, it
*  works on, you know, the intersection
*  of really cognition and action.
*  If you're an expert,
*  if you're an expert, yeah, it's better. That's the point
*  that Sean was getting at.
*  If you're an expert, you can do it implicitly
*  and better than you can do it explicitly. But if you're not,
*  you better stick to, you know,
*  maybe trying to figure out what you're doing.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And this goes beyond music, presumably.
*  I mean, is this a general lesson
*  for creativity or
*  mastery that, you know, what we aim to
*  do by mastering the subject
*  is taking some of the more
*  system two parts of it, the
*  parts that we really need to think about everything
*  we do and
*  transferring them into system one.
*  So, that's our goal.
*  Yeah, and that's actually, well, that's actually
*  one of my colleagues, one of my
*  people who was the professor
*  who was on my dissertation committee
*  at Georgetown works in his
*  he actually was also
*  with Poggio at MIT, but he works
*  with automaticity.
*  And the idea is things going
*  from frontal to further back to
*  parietal lobe, which is kind of the top of your head.
*  And he sees that happen over time
*  as people practice simple tasks.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably
*  obviously true that when we master
*  something, we want to get, you know, the muscle
*  memory or whatever it is. We want to make it
*  automatic. But it's interesting to me
*  that we're now able to actually see it
*  literally in locations in the brain.
*  I mean, how advanced is that
*  project, trying to see, like, literally
*  something that we would have done
*  with part of our brain lighting up
*  as we get better at it, the same task
*  lights up a different part of our brain.
*  Yeah, so
*  the technology that we have available
*  to us now really makes that
*  possible. We've done our series of studies
*  with both electroencephalography
*  in terms of
*  correlational work. I've also had the
*  opportunity to use transcranial
*  direct current stimulation, which
*  is actually placing two electrodes
*  in someone's scalp noninvasively
*  and sending a weak electrical current
*  into the brain, in which you kind of
*  flip the neuroimaging pattern
*  paradigm on its head.
*  And with EEG
*  or fMRI research and neuroimaging,
*  what you're looking for is to see
*  what happens in the brain when
*  I either have two groups of participants
*  like novices or experts, or I have
*  two different tasks, such as performing
*  a memorized melody or an improvised
*  melody. With the stimulation,
*  what we look for, we say, if we target
*  this brain area and try to modulate
*  the activity in an inhibitory
*  or disinhibitory
*  kind of way, do we see
*  a difference in the output of the behavior?
*  Yeah.
*  And so we were able to use
*  both of these methods
*  to look at these
*  this hypofrontality and movement
*  to posterior activity. I think it's
*  important to say the difference is really
*  between the experts
*  and novices, so to different
*  groups, our variables,
*  the number of gigs or how much experience
*  you'd had in jazz. But I wouldn't
*  just, I wouldn't be so quick to say
*  that, you know, we're
*  relying only on system one
*  when you're an expert in
*  system two when you're a novice, because
*  my theory is, I haven't
*  tested this yet, and I would love to do this
*  experiment, is if we
*  look at smaller time scales,
*  specifically when errors
*  happen, and errors and mistakes
*  in lots of the creativity
*  literature are associated with, you know,
*  breakthroughs of creative performance
*  where a misstep took you
*  on a new trajectory,
*  increased uncertainty,
*  and then you kind of, you went with it.
*  And then when you go with that, you're
*  resolving it, and that kind of brings it back ultimately
*  to this, the same kind of expectation
*  theory that we talk about on the perception
*  side of things. Sure.
*  It's like, I was talking to somebody today, I was saying that
*  I was
*  seeing one of your old talks, Dave,
*  and I was thinking like
*  a Formula One race car driver, right?
*  You're just cruising down the road, you're just in the zone,
*  and then all of a sudden somebody like checks you,
*  or something happens, you're like, oh my god, wait!
*  And then you get out of it, but you could get
*  the lead because of that, because you make that
*  explicit decision to do something
*  different.
*  But I think
*  one of the things that I was thinking
*  of when Dave brought
*  in the whole thing about changing behavior
*  and whether
*  it's this kind of distinction
*  between Dave and me
*  and in our academic career
*  of trying to use
*  these stimuli and use music
*  to try to figure out and discover things about the human brain.
*  And I think that's the
*  overarching dominant
*  paradigm in music cognition.
*  And I think what we're more
*  interested in now that
*  we're running a business, but also
*  as musicians, because we're curious
*  about the music, is to say, okay,
*  let's sit back now,
*  we have these wonderful tools that can show
*  these amazing things that are happening in the brain,
*  but we know what they are.
*  And now that we know what these signatures
*  and these markers are, we know there's
*  dopamine here, we know there's certain
*  neural signatures for
*  event-related potentials
*  when there's error, which is
*  detected, which is like surprise,
*  or this tension.
*  So what we're trying to do now in our next
*  research, and we're actually
*  working
*  with the National Science Foundation to try to get
*  this done in the near future,
*  is to say, okay,
*  and the things that we're looking at in secret
*  core laboratories and the business end of it,
*  to say, this is what we
*  think the surprise is in the music,
*  in this information theory, kind of caveman
*  kind of way, but you know what, that's not
*  accounting for everything, right?
*  And so why is it?
*  And maybe we can get some of that
*  gap closed through music theory, and then we
*  have more of a music theory.
*  But some of that is, we need to
*  actually bring the 13 to 19
*  year olds, or whoever it is,
*  who's consuming this music,
*  and we actually have to tailor
*  these controlled stimuli,
*  and what we're actually
*  measuring is in the music.
*  And the stimulus
*  that we're using, it sounds
*  kind of mad scientisty,
*  but the stimulus is these kids' brains.
*  We're looking at what
*  happens in the brains, and we're trying to say,
*  okay, what gets that reaction that we know is
*  there? Because all these, we're standing
*  on the shoulders of giants, and
*  you know, Robert Sartori,
*  and all these other, you know, Ani Patel, and
*  us, you know, and other people have made these
*  discoveries, we know what it looks like in the brain,
*  how can we get that reaction?
*  You see what I'm saying? So we're using the brain
*  to learn about music, and
*  it seems like that, you know,
*  that helps us, but it also seems like there's
*  not enough of that, in academia
*  even, and we're continuing to publish
*  these results. And so because everybody's
*  looking at, you know, using
*  this kind of stale, controlled music
*  to try to see what happens in the brain. I mean, it's not
*  necessarily stale, but you know, because
*  of how science works, you have to only
*  change one thing. Yeah, and it brings up
*  a related issue that I wanted to get into, because
*  we talked about improvisation, and
*  the test that you did, David, involved
*  individual guitarists listening
*  to a pre-recorded background track, but
*  another aspect of improvisation
*  is that you're in a group, right?
*  You can be on the stage with a bunch of people
*  improvising separately, and
*  I'll confess, as we're recording this, I'm just
*  a few days after doing a webcast
*  with Wynton Marsalis.
*  Wynton was one of my first guests
*  here on Mindscape, and so he
*  returned the favor, he had me on his webcast,
*  and he's just very interested
*  in, you know, the science, or
*  whatever we can learn about
*  how people are interacting
*  there on stage with their creativity.
*  And certainly making mistakes was a big
*  part of it, recovering, being
*  surprised, sometimes you're in sync,
*  sometimes you're exactly out of sync,
*  like people are doing opposite things, and sometimes
*  that's okay. How far have we gone
*  in studying how the different brains
*  of different musicians are interacting
*  with each other up there in real time?
*  Well, first,
*  feel free to give Wynton a call for me,
*  I'd love to have him in his group in a
*  neuroimaging study.
*  It's interesting that you say that,
*  so, coming from
*  growing up, I was a big fan of
*  the band FISH, rock
*  improvisation, the kind of that's
*  where, that was my access point
*  to improv before I got into fusion
*  and jazz and other styles
*  of improvisation,
*  and I think you really hit the nail
*  on the head, is that
*  what really drives
*  that live performance with a group
*  is when the synchrony happens,
*  you know, the whole
*  building feels it, when
*  the four or five members are
*  in sync together, and there's some preliminary
*  work,
*  that's really where I kind of found
*  that you could even record
*  guitarists with
*  EEG signals, and the signal wouldn't
*  be distorted enough, there's a group in
*  Germany
*  who looked at dual guitarists
*  and improvisation and having
*  them improvise together, now this is,
*  as you add more
*  musicians, four
*  or five, six, you add more complexity,
*  more things are changing, so they went from one
*  to two and looked at duets.
*  Not to mention looking at the
*  perceivers, right?
*  You would also want to see if
*  there's any synchrony there with the audience
*  and that would be really special.
*  Right, so as far as I know, there's two places in the world
*  that have the types of facilities
*  where they have an auditorium
*  with neurological and
*  physiological metrics for an audience
*  and musicians on stage,
*  McMaster University,
*  and Canada,
*  and the Max Planck
*  Institute in Germany,
*  which actually before
*  I joined Seeker Chord Laboratories,
*  I was going to head over to Germany
*  as a postdoc and then when we realized
*  that this kind of research, because we could kind of
*  lead the ship, steer the ship,
*  and what exactly, what kind of music
*  we choose and artists
*  and how we design our studies,
*  that's definitely on the forefront of
*  our research goals is further exploring
*  the interactions both between band members
*  and also the audience as well.
*  And what you said you've gotten so far
*  is to get to Fish's management for that?
*  Yes, yes, so
*  I bet, it's funny, Scott and I
*  were attending the Northeast Music Cognition Conference
*  I believe it was back in 2017.
*  I think it was the week between my wedding
*  and my honeymoon
*  and I gave a talk there and afterwards
*  a big Fish fan up in Massachusetts came up to me.
*  He's a medical doctor, he uses
*  Ronald Hirschberg who looks at
*  the clinical aspects of music
*  and how it can affect rehabilitation of
*  military vets.
*  And he had been, he was a huge
*  Fish fan, he had been like, he had
*  recorded with a group of a hundred people, some
*  background vocals and told me this whole story
*  from 1992 in like an old church
*  and he came up to me and he's like, all I could think
*  about, now I didn't mention Fish or anything
*  during my talk, it was focusing on jazz
*  as we've been talking about, but he said all I could think about
*  during your talk was doing a study with
*  the four guys in Fish. And I was like, oh my god,
*  and then we just started talking and going into it,
*  I know their management.
*  So we wrote a letter to their management
*  we included all of our CVs
*  and our credit and our post publications
*  and they were like, we'll forward it to the band
*  and then you fast forward a couple of months later
*  there was actually an academic
*  conference called the Fish Studies Conference
*  in Oregon and I got to go
*  out there and get coffee with Mike Gordon, right?
*  Oh, that's good.
*  And propose this study
*  of getting basically all four guys
*  hooked up to EEG devices
*  the drumming data probably wouldn't be so good
*  but actually looking for those
*  peak moments
*  which is really what the work
*  focuses on is those peak
*  creative moments. There's quite a bit of research
*  looking at improvisation
*  just generally as an activity
*  versus other forms of musical
*  performance like composition or playing a memorized
*  melody, but I think that's
*  kind of a consistent focus and that's where flow comes
*  into play is there's distinct
*  peak moments that
*  if you asked everyone involved
*  who was performing, you know, when were those
*  I believe there would be high agreement
*  and then to look at that underlying brain data
*  and musical data is definitely a goal
*  of mine. Another fascinating aspect
*  of the results from this study is
*  that we found critical hemispheric differences
*  between the left and right hemisphere.
*  In the mid 90s, Alcon and
*  Goldberg developed and tested
*  a neurocognitive theory which showed
*  evidence for the left hemisphere being more
*  engaged for routinized and habitual
*  tasks. The right hemisphere is
*  recruited in more novel and unfamiliar
*  situations.
*  So in our study, expertise
*  or jazz experience
*  was significantly
*  predictive of the quality of an improvisation.
*  Thus, when we first
*  analyzed the brain activity associated
*  with high and low quality improvisations
*  the high quality ones
*  showed us both posterior
*  shifts in brain activity and
*  left hemispheric activity.
*  So if we were to define creativity by this
*  product definition, which is what we were doing
*  when we're asking experts in a domain
*  to rate the improvisations
*  the left hemisphere
*  would be critical because
*  the experts are likely using
*  well-learned routines and a
*  jazz vocabulary and phrases they've learned
*  over many years to construct a
*  solo on the spot to new cord changes.
*  However, once we
*  were statistically controlled for expertise
*  then the brain activity
*  shifted from the left
*  to the right hemisphere
*  indicating that that neural activity in the right
*  hemisphere underlies the more
*  creative improvisations once
*  we remove the effects of jazz
*  experience.
*  So these results represent more of a
*  process definition of creativity
*  where novelty and flexibility
*  are central.
*  So generally, if creativity is defined
*  in terms of the quality of a product
*  like a song or an invention or a
*  poem or painting, then the left
*  hemisphere plays a key role.
*  But if creativity is understood as
*  a person's ability to deal with novel
*  and unfamiliar situations
*  as is the case for novice improvisers
*  then the right hemisphere plays
*  a key role.
*  The other thing, you know
*  on the flip side of this, you're both
*  musicians in some sense, right?
*  I'm not familiar with your
*  work per se, but I believe this is one of the things you do.
*  How much does
*  this academic
*  scientific study of what's going on
*  in the brain, etc.
*  change how you are as musicians?
*  Does it affect how you play, how you enjoy it,
*  how you think about your success?
*  It's interesting.
*  When I came up with this, I was kind of a
*  disgruntled, not disgruntled, but
*  I was
*  I wasn't
*  anyhow, I was having a great time
*  working for a Harvard neurologist
*  in Boston
*  and I was also, I was kind of
*  not focused, put it that way.
*  And I was working on this huge
*  album project and it was my first album
*  and I was trying to do everything
*  independently and perfectly
*  and professionally and I had
*  the Boston String Quartet and I was
*  rented out like WGBH for the
*  Frasier Studios for their big
*  Steinway Model D to make everything
*  was perfect and pure and that sort of thing.
*  And that's really when I came up with the idea
*  one of our co-founders
*  Brian Owens, who's back here in
*  Virginia, I kept sending him
*  what do you think of this bridge, what do you think of
*  this bridge, he's like I don't know, they all sound the same.
*  And so I was like, I was doing
*  fMRI and so I was looking fMRI
*  in language and auditory processing and I was like
*  I can put this all together and that's kind of
*  how I came up with it.
*  The short story for me
*  as a musician is really
*  like working on this
*  60, 80 hours a week for like the next
*  10 years after that, that was 2011, right?
*  Has not only occupied my time
*  but also discouraged me
*  from writing new music because I keep saying
*  I'm very close
*  to knowing everything there is to know
*  to writing the perfect song
*  so I'm just going to wait
*  and I'll put my ideas together
*  then. And it's kind
*  of given me excuse to kind of procrastinate
*  from the creative side of my
*  musicianship.
*  There is no such thing as the perfect song
*  sadly, it's the same thing with writing
*  or anything like that. Of course,
*  yeah, but it's just like the idea that
*  I'm going to have a lot
*  more data to base off
*  like why would I write something now
*  when I could write it with the
*  benefit of having all
*  these insights
*  from all the greatest songs
*  ever written. So that's
*  in my mind kind of
*  justifying my
*  procrastination.
*  But I'm still jammed
*  since then.
*  But finally,
*  you both mentioned
*  several times the concept of flow
*  being in the zone,
*  feeling it.
*  To what extent can we extend this beyond
*  not just music
*  but even art all the way into our lives,
*  right? Are we learning something here
*  about how to live
*  well, not just play
*  music well? Is there something to be said
*  for becoming such an expert at life
*  that it becomes second nature to
*  us and we're in flow and in the zone?
*  Sure. That's the
*  philosophy that I've taken.
*  I think flow is related
*  to positive
*  psychology. It's a theory that's really
*  where it comes from. As a mental state where
*  really individuals are immersed
*  in a task and there's this intrinsic
*  motivation that
*  really you choose
*  to do it because just the experience
*  and having that energized
*  focus, it's a
*  joyful process and you're totally
*  absorbed cognitively. I think
*  this definitely expands to
*  I talk to my friend who codes
*  video games to
*  people who enjoy hiking. Reading
*  is a task that's on high flow.
*  For me, I keep
*  my sanity
*  by when my
*  yoga routine
*  or music practicing
*  with my band falls out
*  or writing and I lose those pieces
*  because work comes into play too much
*  and I get too caught up in other things
*  I notice
*  the effects
*  I come higher in anxiety and maybe a little
*  more depressed and when those pieces fall
*  out of line and I try really
*  hard to
*  there's a discipline piece also
*  of saying
*  you don't always see
*  the output of writing your
*  song and then having it be commercially successful
*  with or without the
*  formula but there's another component
*  of just engaging
*  and developing
*  a craft regularly
*  which I think makes these flow experiences
*  more common and easier
*  to enter into.
*  Yeah, and
*  Dave brings up the
*  paradoxical with flow and routine
*  and so you think about people like
*  Steve Jobs or
*  Mark Zuckerberg
*  where you do things routine
*  a lot of things that we do in the company
*  that I'll do
*  that people say like why are you
*  so obsessive
*  compulsive about certain things
*  and to me it's like you know what
*  I don't want to have to worry about what I pick out
*  like Steve Jobs in the case of wearing
*  the turtleneck. I don't have to worry about
*  there's no right answer to me it's like
*  this type of thing that there's like nowhere to answer
*  so why occupy your mind if you're
*  like a big, you know, brilliant person
*  why, you know, and then that way
*  if you don't have to worry about certain
*  things if they're all routine if you
*  are sticking to a routine the things
*  that you are focused on
*  then you can riff on and like that's the kind of
*  thing that you know when we're talking obviously
*  it was a little bit tongue in cheek about like
*  waiting to have the pattern to write the song but like
*  you know it's like jazz right so when you
*  have a lead sheet in jazz you know that the
*  you know that the
*  the chord changes you know
*  for September Song or whatever
*  you know the chord changes are going to be fire
*  you know they're going to be great
*  you know if you do a or if you do
*  like a 2-5-1 or whatever it is
*  you know what the chord changes are and if you
*  have certain constraints
*  then you're able to have more of a
*  flow state in everything else you do
*  yeah
*  you know I got a but now I don't
*  anymore because I think that this is a
*  I mean that's it's you're
*  sacrificing something
*  for something else sure but
*  I don't want to be living in
*  a world where in order to be
*  the best software designer I wear the same
*  clothes every day I think that right but I mean you
*  have people who have secretaries who take care
*  of their laundry for or take care of their
*  phone call you know what I'm saying so they can just
*  like the Rolling Stones you know
*  I read this book one time it's like why are the Rolling Stones
*  so great because they just get
*  there they get out of the bus they
*  go on stage and they play they don't
*  tune the guitars they don't set
*  up the gig they don't do all these things
*  and that's another thing you know you get into the
*  whole tension about the you know
*  you know artists are having to do everything now
*  because you know you know there's
*  no artist development in the music
*  business anymore but you know there's a
*  certain thing to be said for only
*  doing what you're a peak performer at
*  you know you don't have to wear this
*  there is and I
*  very you know I'm being legitimately
*  I'm not playing the devil's advocate now I'm
*  I'm uncertain what to think about
*  this because this is a very provocative fact
*  because the flip side of
*  that is if you're the one who
*  tunes the guitars you know your guitar
*  a little bit better right you know
*  I people are always surprised
*  when I invite them on the podcast
*  and they're not familiar with it and they're like
*  you know they mention
*  my producer or my editor and I'm
*  like yeah that's all me there's no
*  person who is the audio engineer
*  here this is all me and
*  there's definitely pluses
*  and minuses to that right the audio quality
*  is not as good but at least I understand
*  what it's going on I certainly don't have any of those
*  people so yeah I don't have a secretary
*  yeah I get it yeah well
*  I think when we talk about
*  flow in this very general
*  sense we're not really
*  talking about how it's
*  operationalized in terms of the
*  the psychology literature
*  and the work on
*  flow is I mean
*  there's very little
*  neuroscientific work on it and
*  you know it's not well studied
*  and I think part of that is because of the complexity
*  there's nine
*  kind of different components
*  and so people look at they break those into
*  two subsets of components we can talk about
*  there's conditions that allow
*  flow to happen in the external so
*  there's two main features there are
*  is this Chick-Step Mihaly
*  this book flow
*  1990s kind of
*  seminal publication there but there's been a number
*  of papers since then
*  so there's this balance between challenge and
*  skill as one of the conditions
*  and then clear goals and
*  feedback
*  so those are the conditions that's how we set up
*  some research they choose kind of
*  one of these aspects such as the
*  balance between challenge and skill I know I've
*  seen some work where you know you set up
*  they've had people come in and do
*  math problems and depending on
*  your math ability they would create an algorithm
*  that would present math problems to you
*  and how you if you get problems wrong or correct
*  they would advance you or move you back on the level
*  and kind of have you hooked up to
*  some type of electroencephalography and look for
*  you know neural correlates of this
*  facet of flow
*  when we talk about this in terms of music
*  I think what we're miss if we're defining
*  flow only in terms of balance between
*  challenge and skill which is this condition of flow
*  we're missing out on
*  the key
*  phenomenological aspect of flow
*  the subjective state that people report
*  and experience and on that side
*  we talk about those dimensions include
*  intense concentration and
*  immersion the merging of
*  action and awareness
*  a sense of control
*  the distorted sense of time that Scott mentioned
*  earlier and that and critically
*  I think the experience of intrinsic
*  reward so for studies
*  for studies that only
*  encompass flow as only a balance
*  between challenge and skill such as
*  the math task I would ask you
*  how much do those people love math
*  right
*  I think a lot of this
*  comes down to who would come to
*  where you are in a given day and say
*  you're lucky to be doing
*  what you're doing for a living
*  or have that hobby
*  or whatever it is because I think that's what people
*  think of when they think of somebody
*  who's lucky to have a certain job
*  it's they're doing something that they're
*  good at but it's a little bit challenging
*  you know like
*  and not everybody
*  finds that and I think as
*  an educator which I know Dave has spent
*  in his other life he spent a lot of time
*  in esteem education and that sort of thing
*  I think we have a long way to go
*  in helping students
*  and children in helping them
*  find the place in the world where
*  they're going to be beneficial to society
*  be able to feed themselves and also
*  somehow reach this kind of zone
*  you know
*  so what I conclude from this
*  is that life and success and creativity
*  are complicated and difficult
*  but that it's possible to make progress
*  and learn about them and I love
*  the idea of using music as
*  sort of a paradigm for
*  studying all these things in the brain
*  so David Rosen and Scott Miles
*  thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast
*  thank you Sean
*  you
