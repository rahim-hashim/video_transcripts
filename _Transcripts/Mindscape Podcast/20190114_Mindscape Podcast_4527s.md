Sometimes science is asking esoteric questions about the fundamental nature of reality. Other times, it just wants to solve a murder. Today’s guest, Raychelle Burks, is an analytical chemist at St. Edward’s University in Texas. Before becoming a full-time academic, she worked in a crime lab using chemistry to help police track suspects, and now she does research on building new detectors for use in forensic analyses. We talk about how the real world of forensic investigation differs from the version you see portrayed on CSI, and how real chemists use their tools to help law enforcement agencies fight crime. We may even touch on how criminals could use chemical knowledge to get away with their dastardly deeds.


 Raychelle Burks received her Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Nebraska, and is now an Assistant Professor at St. Edward’s University. Her current research focuses on the development of portable colorimetry sensors that can be used in the field. She is active on Twitter as @DrRubidium, and often appears as an expert on podcasts and TV documentaries, as well as speaking at conventions and festivals. She is an active advocate for women and underrepresented minorities in science.

# Episode 29: Raychelle Burks on the Chemistry of Murder
**Mindscape Podcast:** [January 14, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkOucTc6NXM)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Now let's face it,
*  we've all contemplated how we would go about committing the perfect murder. Or if any of you
*  are truly innocents out there, perhaps you've contemplated what it would be like to be the
*  victim of a perfect murder. One way or the other, perfect murders are the kinds of things that dwell
*  in our minds. We want to know what it would be like. One of the things that we think is true,
*  anyone who has watched TV or movies knows, it is harder these days to commit the perfect murder
*  than it might have been in the past. The ability of the police and their friends to investigate
*  crimes is better than it ever has been before, in large part because of science. Because of our
*  ability to do chemistry and forensic science that teaches us something from the crime scene about
*  what actually went down. So that's what we're going to talk about today. Ray Burks is an
*  analytical chemist who moved from actually working in a crime lab to becoming a professor
*  at St. Edward's University in Texas, where she continues to work in forensics. Her lab
*  constructs detectors that look for explosives, drugs, and other substances of questionable
*  repute to help the cops catch the bad guys. We're going to talk about different types of poison,
*  if that's the way you want to roll. How to dispose of a body. This is a big problem for
*  would-be-murderers out there. And also the major differences between what you watch on CSI and the
*  real world of a forensic investigator. As far as I can tell, the major difference involves paperwork.
*  So hopefully this is going to be an amusing listen. Usually in podcasts, my goal is that
*  something educational happens, but I'm not quite sure I really want this one to be very educational.
*  Let's stick with amusing, shall we? Hopefully this will not turn out to be useful in your own
*  future planning. I really don't want Mindscape Podcast to be investigated by the FBI. Despite
*  our best efforts though, it's very possible you're going to learn something as well as have a few
*  thought-provoking ideas go into your mind. All right, let's go.
*  Ray Burks, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you. So I'm very excited. We're going to
*  talk about chemistry and murder. Murder. Which came first for you, the chemistry or the murder?
*  Murder. Murder came first? Murder. That got you into the chemistry? Murder got me into chemistry.
*  How did that happen? So I wanted to be a lawyer and I was a real dorky kid. I used to go to the
*  library on Saturday carrying a briefcase that my parents got me because they supported my dorkiness.
*  And I used to go and I used to read law books and learn about collateral estoppel. So again,
*  really fun. Sexy stuff. I know. Very fun kid. And then in junior high, I got an opportunity to go
*  to a junior high trip. And we went to Washington, DC, which of course, if you want to be a lawyer
*  and you're a kid, that's like, but then we had an opportunity to visit FBI field office. And at the
*  time they were kind of had to tour a little bit of forensic science, talking about crime and how
*  science could be used for that. And I had never ever before in my life thought science was remotely
*  interesting or useful. But this really did it for me because I was just like, what? You can
*  use science to do stuff? And I don't know why it never really hit me before. Some people,
*  of course, my age in the shuttle era would have been big into space or dinosaurs and that never
*  really got me. But the forensic science, that really resonated. And then from there, I just
*  went down the nerd rabbit hole. Because this was high school. Junior high. But then that's when
*  you actually actively be a minister in chemistry for its own sake. Yes. Because a lot of the tests,
*  the idea that you didn't know what something was and you could do some tests and figure out
*  what it was, that really got me. The solving mysteries. And I think that it's kind of what,
*  in a weird way, being a bit of a law nerd when I was little and watching Murder She Wrote with my
*  grandmother and Matlock and there was always some lawyer running around solving or some ex high
*  school teacher who wrote mystery novels just up to no good. So seeing that science could solve these
*  mysteries was really the hook that got me interested. And then that's when I realized,
*  I'm like, oh, so science is kind of a big deal. Yeah. And that's probably common, but you stuck
*  with the whole murder aspect. I mean, I don't know exactly your trajectory. I'll figure it out before
*  I post the episode. But you served, you worked in some kind of law enforcement capacity. Yeah,
*  I was in a crime lab. So I, you know, I, I chemistry and then I went to graduate school
*  and then left graduate school and, and worked in a crime lab for a while. And so, yeah, I mean,
*  that's what I thought I would do for the rest of my life was, you know, be in that line of work.
*  So this is literally the CSI stuff. You know, you're, you're doing the, I don't know what you
*  were doing. You're analyzing compounds, trying to figure out what it is. Well, that's, you know,
*  I worked at a small crime lab was just five people. And, you know, you're doing a lot of,
*  a little bit of everything. Sometimes you get called out to a crime scene. But a lot of times
*  you just, you know, you're pulling casework that you get assigned. You go down to evidence property,
*  you pick up the stuff and you bring it back and you, who know? I mean, you, you might be doing all
*  kinds of things. I actually did a lot of forensic video and image analysis. In addition to chemical
*  processing and physical processing of prints. Again, it was a very, you know, kind of small.
*  And so you kind of had to like cross train and do certain things. And then we also, you know,
*  when we were called out to do, you know, crime scene work, that was something that you, you know,
*  you had to be requested to go out. So that, and then it was usually some type of major incident.
*  Um, so it could have been a homicide. It could have been say a robbery, um, which, you know,
*  threat of violence or something of that nature, um, that you would get called out and have to do
*  kind of all this crime scene work. Any particularly memorable incidents from that
*  period of your life? Tons of memorable incidents. Very few I could talk about.
*  This is your law training. Yes. Yes. That's right. So I would say, you know, for CSI, I think,
*  you know, and I knew this just from, you know, really being involved in going through education
*  and everything is that, you know, first of all, in CSI, no, none of us are that good looking.
*  None of us have wardrobes that are that hip or cool. I never had sunglasses that neat. Um, and,
*  you know, I always used to watch those shows, you know, especially when I was
*  in that job and they never show them doing paperwork. And I know I spent at least half my
*  time documenting and writing reports. You think the show would be improved if there's more
*  paperwork? I think the show would be improved. Um, if it, yeah, CSI paperwork. Yeah. But I think
*  that was the fun part is, you know, it's, it's like, okay, so take all of that, cut the episode by 20
*  minutes and put in just writing reports. More paperwork. More paperwork. Yeah. I have no idea
*  why you're not a showrunner. I don't know either. Yes. So then what, uh, in the world gave you the
*  idea that what you really wanted to do was be a professor. That's so I think it's funny because
*  you know, you, I planned this whole thing where I was going to work in the crime lab for a long time.
*  And definitely when I was in graduate school, you know, you're kind of sometimes are surrounded by
*  folks that want to be in academic and a little bit different in chemistry because chemistry is
*  also very, uh, in industry. It's useful for things other than being a professor. Not like
*  theoretical physics. Well, I didn't, that was not me. Uh, but I think, you know, chemistry with its
*  history and applications, you know, there's the, the, the kind of common thing is that a third are
*  in academia, a third are kind of in government labs, a thirds in, in industry. Um, so, you know,
*  lots of applications in that way. And so actually most of the people that I went to graduate school
*  with were not going to be academics. So it's just chemistry. It's a little bit different for other
*  fields. So this was your PhD program. You had a PhD before the crime lab. Yeah. And so a lot of
*  people actually, no, I left, this is what not to do kids. Um, I left graduate school to take the
*  super awesome job, um, because there's not that many jobs. Uh, and I said, you know what? I will
*  totally write my dissertation while I'm working in a new full-time job. Famous last mistake.
*  So funny. Um, I mean, I did, but it just, let's just say it took a little bit longer, uh, than,
*  than I had deluded myself and my advisor. Yeah. Thinking. Um, but yeah, so I think with, you know,
*  I think most of the people in, in definitely in my PhD program, uh, in my, in the lab that I was in,
*  um, you know, a lot went into, you know, working at say, Glacko Smith Klein or Merck or, you know,
*  there's, there's a colleague that works at NIST. Um, so a big mix academia is, is not the, the,
*  the big deal. Um, and so that was not uncommon. And you planned for that, like in your programs,
*  you know, a lot of people are going into industry and chemistry and so, or they're, you know,
*  they're going to be full-time researchers, but not professors and nothing, you know, not academics.
*  And so that was really interesting to me because that certainly wasn't what I went to graduate
*  school for. Um, but I had, you know, I learned a lot and I definitely, when I, you know, you start
*  doing a job, then I realized, Hey, I kind of actually miss doing the research and development
*  because when you're active casework, you just have no time. Certainly not doing research. No,
*  no. I mean, and a lot of paperwork, a lot of paperwork to be getting done, but your case
*  backlog in some places can be, you know, several months, if not years. And, and so even though you
*  might be best positioned to develop some new method, you have no time or no resources in
*  order to do that. Um, so I missed that and, uh, and I did miss teaching, even though, you know,
*  when you go to graduate school, as you know, you don't really get a PhD in teaching or education.
*  No. And so the more successful you are, the less you teach. Right. So it was, uh, so it was kind
*  of funny to me. And then, you know, going back into academia, I realized that, wow, I did,
*  I did miss these things and it kind of in a way snuck up on me, uh, cause it's not quite what I
*  planned for, but I do like, I like the training aspect too of, of undergraduate research. Um,
*  cause I'm at a principally undergraduate institution. So, you know, the idea of, of,
*  of training folks to do field work or lab work and, you know, really giving them the opportunity
*  to develop new skills, um, is in an informative way is, is really fun. I find that it's very hard.
*  You know, some days you're like, I hope I am not messing this up. A lot of responsibility,
*  but it's also a lot of fun to see, you know, people really grow into their scholarship
*  and into their profession. So I do physics for a living. Some people have the misimpression that
*  they're, this is somehow close to chemistry. In fact, I know nothing about chemistry. I've never
*  even taken a chemistry class at the university level. I took high school chemistry. So if you,
*  if you had in mind that what you were interested in was sort of the forensic side of chemistry,
*  what kind of chemists would you become? I know there's physical and organic and organic and so
*  forth. I would say analytical. So what does that mean? So I like to call analytical chemists,
*  the detectives of chemistry. So we tend not to make chemicals. We find them. Okay. Um, and we
*  tend to find them in a sea of other ones. So, you know, I always joke when, when people say,
*  oh, it's really hard to find a needle in a haystack, that should actually be pretty easy
*  because a needle and a haystack are very different, very different. Um, but analytical chemists,
*  it's about finding a needle, particular needle in a stack of needles. Yep. Um, and so while we don't
*  often build, you know, or we don't do a lot of synthesis, we may build molecules or engineer
*  uh, instruments that will then be used as detective tools. Right. Um, and so I think
*  that analysis and then also being able to look at the data and, and treat it in a certain way,
*  whether it's statistically or modeling the data to then kind of stand back and look at it,
*  what the hell does it mean? Um, and, and, and really it is sometimes that way where you just like,
*  you project it and you have this thing and then you have to like step back and look at it. And it
*  might be one of those things where I know for sure this has happened to me where you're looking at
*  the data, you know, it means something and you bolt upright at 2am and it has come to you. What,
*  where you've seen this pattern before, what the pattern indicates. Um, and then you run to write
*  it down. Well, this is fascinating because I think that, you know, people who are not chemists or
*  scientists for a living might have a different idea of what it means to do chemistry. The,
*  the process you're describing, it sounds much more creative and artistic than a lot of people
*  might think. But so when you say the pattern, you recognize the pattern, a pattern in what,
*  what are you looking at? So, you know, there are sometimes, uh, so I build sensing devices
*  and sometimes they're chemical sensors. So one chemical will interact with another and give off
*  some signal. And a lot of times, um, it's a, it's a color, it changes color or it fluoresces. Um,
*  there might be like bioluminescence or chemo, some kind of, you know, luminescent event.
*  And so you might do something like trying to not only, you might have several of those sensors
*  and then not just do you look at how does it change. You're looking how, if one change is
*  in relationship to another, is there some type of pattern in how certain sensors behave?
*  And then what does that tell you about what they're interacting with? Cause oftentimes
*  you're trying to design something to find, at least for me being forensic, I'm, I'm trying to
*  find quote bad stuff, weapons, chemical, biological, explosives, um, scheduled stuff.
*  So how then does the sensor respond? Because it's not enough to build it and have it be reliable
*  and be like, yep, it always does. It always turns red when it's in, what you ask, why does it do
*  that? What is, what is the risk? Why does it turn red here, but green here? And so sometimes you look
*  at the data and you can use various tools and sometimes you use chemometrics, which is like
*  fancy chemistry statistics. I had, there's a way to, again, you're looking at changes of changes
*  sometimes and you, you map the data and, and sometimes you'll look at a plot and I think some,
*  you know, even economic data, there's lots of people that have all kinds of data and you might
*  plot it in a lot of different ways. Bar chart, pie chart, Venn diagram, like you're just plotting
*  a play and then you know that there's something there and you just, you know, sometimes you just
*  don't recognize the pattern or how one thing influences another. You just need to step back
*  from it for a moment. And literally, it could be literally, I have literally projected things
*  and literally just, and just gazed on it. And I do feel like maybe that is a bit of the creative
*  thing where sometimes I've gone to museums and pieces of art and you're not sure that you're
*  seeing what either quote you should or, or what maybe either the artist thought, or maybe you're
*  seeing something that, that is not intended, but you need to get a better look at it. And sometimes
*  you step forward, but sometimes like there's been a few pieces in the, I remember when I first
*  time I went to the Efeatsy gallery and saw say, say like the, the allegory of spring or the birth
*  of Venus, I had no idea they were that large. Cause you see photographs, you know, or, you know,
*  something or like the Mona Lisa is that small. And you just have to step sometimes with the
*  ones that you're like, that thing is the entire side of the room and you are almost out in the
*  hallway trying to really see the full picture of all the data and what it means in relationship to
*  other data. And that's what oftentimes we do in science is that, you know, because you might have
*  a very simple data set. Okay, this thing turns red, but then the more sensors you add, then you have
*  17 of those things. And then you're trying to detect a hundred different chemicals. So all of
*  a sudden you have a very complicated pattern and you need to kind of step back and say, well,
*  what does it all mean in relationship to each other? And so that part, there is a creative aspect in
*  how you visualize it, you know, and I think sometimes I look at why did that person paint that, that way
*  with that shadow or why is that so abstract or why did they sculpt it in that way in this?
*  And then maybe it's, you know, maybe we'll never know. I do think that sometimes artists take stuff
*  literally to their grave and they don't communicate the intention or anything. And sometimes,
*  you know, the point is you take from it what you find important. But you do sometimes from every
*  angle have to step kind of back and see, okay, can I interpret it in different ways? And I feel the
*  same thing with scientific data, different treatments, and it's not as if you're making it
*  up, but you are doing different, like, again, I'm going to make it a bar chart versus a line graph.
*  And then what does that visualization reveal about the underlying process?
*  And the thing about chemistry and crime fighting or whatever is that there's so many different ways
*  that the chemicals are involved in the investigation, right? So let's say you are called out,
*  like you still get called out, even know that you're a professor now, not a crime lab technician.
*  Do you visit crime scenes? No, because I'm, you know, in a way I'm not because it's a very stressful
*  job and academia is stressful in different ways. But also, you know, there's the cost benefit,
*  I get to do other things. Yeah, okay. All right, let's pretend that that's not true. Let's pretend
*  you get called out all the time. What is on your mind when you're called out to a crime scene? What
*  are you going to be looking for as a chemist? What good is the chemist out there at the murder
*  investigation scene? Well, I think it obviously depends on, you know, what kind of background.
*  So typically when you would get there, you would get briefed by whoever in charge of the scene,
*  which, you know, is not you. And so, no, but like when you watch on the TV, you're like,
*  what are the police for? You know, because the CSI people are always running around. But like,
*  you know, the background is important of, you know, what should we be looking for? What shouldn't we
*  be looking for? What's missing is just as important as what maybe should be there. And so, so what does
*  that mean? What's missing? Well, let's say that you had somebody that had a severe shellfish allergy
*  and they had, and you hear that from family, but yet you're not seeing anything. You don't see an
*  EpiPen. Right. You don't see, you know, you don't even see a medical alert bracelet, which is really
*  odd. The dog that didn't bark. You know, I mean, you just also what's not there. Or if the person
*  was, you know, you hear from the ME that there's someone was shot or somebody was stabbed or they're
*  strangled, but there's literally no weapon around. So what's not there can be just as important as
*  what is there. And so, you know, and the same thing goes with any kind of analytical data. And
*  I'm sure in physics and astronomy, at least from, you know, friends that I have in those fields,
*  it's not only looking for what's present, but what is not there can tell you a lot too.
*  So if someone is poisoned or something like that, I could absolutely understand the usefulness of a
*  chemist. If someone's shot or knife, does there's still things for the chemist to do with the crime
*  scene? There might be. And chemical tests though, in which whether it would be a chemist there or
*  not. But sometimes, you know, you might do like gunshot residue. And so presumptive tests for that,
*  or they would actually collect, you know, swab hands, very similar to what some, you know,
*  you get you get screened for testing at the airport, you know, and they might swab your hands,
*  and then they might actually take that swab and secure it and transport it. And then you maybe do
*  some some x-ray spectroscopy and some type of, you know, atomic emission or absorption spectroscopy
*  to see, okay, are the metal components that you would typically find in that in gunshot residue,
*  are they present and maybe at what amount? So that would be some level of analytical chemistry.
*  But also, let's say that there is, you know, you're trying to say, okay, is this red brown stain?
*  Is it blood or not? Okay, then you would do some type of chemical presumptive test,
*  or even okay, so it is blood, but is it human? Then you might do an immuno assay that would,
*  you know, illuminate that. So what does that mean exactly? How do you do and how do you figure out
*  whether blood is human or not? Certain antibodies for different types of animals would be present
*  or not present. And you can do kind of like the same type of technology as a pregnancy test.
*  Okay. To kind of do it's really a dipstick. It does look a lot, you know, reminds you a lot of
*  a pregnancy test. And you can kind of get an idea and say, oh, it's, you know, which doesn't,
*  you know, that might lead you to another thing of why is there dog blood here then? Like, you know,
*  yeah, there's no dog. What's that? So that I think that's another thing is that there are lots of
*  tests that folks do. And so, you know, a lot of the like, even the presumptive and by presumptive
*  test, I mean, that it's just a quick screening test, they usually they change color really visual,
*  really fast to do. And so sometimes there's real popular ones for for scheduled drugs that will,
*  you know, if you've roadside, they're very popular, like Highway Patrol, or if you're
*  screening something, and then you put a little sample in a little bag, you break a couple of
*  ampules and boom, purple, right? And then you don't even that's not even a professional chemist.
*  That's like the comp on the street can do a little sure. And a lot of those have been developed.
*  Yeah, right. And then there's a lot of development behind that,
*  to get it down to it being that quote, simple to do. Yeah. And so those types of tests are very
*  popular. And then can again, they're just they're just, you know, providing quick information to
*  maybe make some type of a command decision. And so that's chemistry, chemical development
*  of fingerprints. So say on paper, you can use an hydrant, which interacts with amino acids turns
*  purplish pink color, like a charm on materials. So you can get fingerprints off of paper that
*  Yeah, visualize. So it'll stay on the material. Yeah, but you can visualize, you know, the this
*  print matter and that that actually came about when you know, folks were trying to do staining
*  and chromatography of proteins and amino acids. And then they were like, Hey, this might be useful
*  for this. And there's many things like, you know, even see a Santa acrylate or super glue fuming
*  that you see a lot on TV. That was a total, you know, oops. I mean, you know, we say that,
*  but that's it's very useful kind of technique. And so that's a very, you know, interesting
*  chemical process that people are still talking about in literature about how exactly it works.
*  What's the mechanism? So we know it works, but the chemistry, the sort of individual chemistry
*  is not completely understood. We think we're pretty good. Pretty good. Okay, but I feel like
*  that's a lot of, you know, we have really good mechanisms worked out, or we think we've got,
*  you know, very strong evidence that this is, is this the action, right, until we don't. Yep.
*  And so, you know, there's lots of and the fun, you know, when I think about, say, slime, which
*  might seem unrelated, you know, the kids and adults, let's face it, love making with the glue and the
*  borax of making slime. And just this year in chemical and engineering news, you know, people,
*  it was, you know, still in literature, in real chemists are still debating about how that actually
*  works. And everyone thought that that was a Fischer lock. And you realize that no, it's not
*  actually that it's actually this instead. I think that you were familiar with this process of slime
*  making that I am. How do you make slime? Okay, so I don't make slime intentionally. Well, any of your
*  listeners that probably have have kids have made it or so that's the, you know, you just basically
*  like Elmer's glue and you add in a little borax, you know, like a soap, borax soap, the powdered
*  soap, old school, I don't know, maybe in college in the labs, they had the borax soap. And then
*  you basically mix it together and it becomes this non-Newtonian fluid. You would love this. I would.
*  I'm going to go home. Yes, it's super and, you know, it's super fun. And of course, you know,
*  you can make it with different types of polymers, clear glue, white glue, people put glitter in it,
*  food coloring and like bespoke slime. But part of it too is even though that process was like,
*  we know how it works. It's a polymer, it cross polymerizes, blah, blah, blah, we're out the door.
*  Then in the last couple years, people were like, actually, it's not this discrete repeating,
*  you know, cross polymerization we thought it was. And actually, and so I find that really fun because
*  even though the best evidence at the time, people were very confident, it's explained a lot,
*  but then you get better, you get better techniques too, right? And we've seen that
*  definitely in forensic science where the trajectory of the field has changed, the instruments get
*  better, you're able to see, you know, literally see either smaller amounts or levels of detail
*  that change, even small amounts can revolutionize an entire thought process.
*  Would you say that chemical forensics is becoming more important over time in crime investigation or
*  less? I definitely think more. I think that, you know, the use of science in both criminal and civil
*  matters has really dramatically increased in the last, I would definitely say in the last,
*  200 years, and definitely in the last 30. And I think it's kind of funny because one of my,
*  you know, show as I grew up with Murder, She Wrote, kind of demonstrates that over, you know,
*  that show was on, I think, for 12 years. But when it was on, you straddled the era of pre-DNA and
*  post. And you see that in the show, the things that they talk about in early episodes and, oh,
*  we can get fingerprints and like ABO typing and you're just like.
*  Why would anyone do that?
*  And then later, you know, it's a very big revolution. And then, you know, even watching shows,
*  you know, Colombo, where they, you know, they'll have a handgun, they'll take a handkerchief
*  from their pocket and think that they're, you know, somehow protecting the prince or they'll
*  take a pen and literally either the pen and stick it down the barrel of the gun to pick it up.
*  That's a bad idea. Right.
*  Destroying all the rifling.
*  But I think, you know, even that visualization, you can see how even the perception,
*  you know, and how shows are run now. And now it's not uncommon to see whole shows where they show
*  folks in Tyveks and they're changing out their booties and they've got gloves that they keep
*  changing every, you know, so you've seen the evolution of a field be mirrored in, you know,
*  television and movies and sometimes, right, and sometimes there's artistic license taken.
*  But definitely the field is that that reflects the big changes in the field, which continue.
*  I mean, they march with the with the technology.
*  And do the chemists get very involved with poisoning and things like that?
*  Or is that mostly medical people?
*  So yeah, medical examiner really depends on on the state. I mean, there's the difference
*  between if you're doing testing of, say, tissues and biological fluids, that's typically under the
*  control of the medical examiner. And then that that person would send tests out or request samples be
*  processed by toxicology folks and maybe histology and pathology, looking at different depending on
*  which like if is it tissue or is it, say, urine or is it that kind of thing. So different types
*  of materials and different types of tests. But if you say, you know, you found some mysterious
*  white powder that actually might go to trace.
*  I see. Right. So once it's in their body, then maybe it's the medical examiner.
*  Yeah, that's a that's a different deal.
*  But when you find all sorts of chemicals around, then the chemists get involved.
*  Yeah. And there was a big workplace poisoning case in Germany this year, where a worker,
*  I mean, allegedly, allegedly, is, you know, dozens of their co workers. And the last one that kind of
*  kicked off them finding that first of all, nobody had known this workplace poisoning was going on,
*  that spanned maybe, you know, he'd worked in that company for 40 years.
*  Just killing people, poisoning, potentially, because, you know, this one worker brought
*  their lunch, you know, in the break room, you're putting in the fridge, you know, your biggest
*  concern is you hope Susan doesn't eat your wontons. Right. Exactly.
*  And so they open up their thing and they see this white powder that they didn't.
*  And so, you know, they, you know, took their supervisor who, you know, at first was like,
*  oh, it's some kind of a prank or whatever. And of course, me being a chemist, I'm like,
*  that's not a prank. That's not a prank.
*  Mysterious white powder is, let's assume, the worst.
*  And so, you know, they do some testing. In the meantime, they also installed CCTV.
*  And it seems as if they did not maybe inform people that they installed cameras. And so it
*  turns out they were, they got this person on video opening lunches.
*  Just for kicks.
*  And that's, I think that's the thing that, you know, the investigation is going to look into
*  of what was going on there. And, you know, they do testing and they realized, you know,
*  it was lead acetate, which is very sweet tasting, but incredibly dangerous.
*  And then they go back and they realize, you know, he had so many different types of poisons,
*  poisons too, that could have potentially mimicked, you know, especially this, these would be like a
*  chronic poisoning, not an acute. So it might look like coworkers were ill.
*  And at the time the person was arrested, there was one coworker in a coma and one on dialysis.
*  So this, this poisoner was an aficionado. Like he wasn't just, he didn't have just a bucket of bad
*  stuff, but he had a retinue of different possible ways.
*  There's a lot there to unpack. Right. And then they start going back and looking at that,
*  how many coworkers of this person had died in the last 20 years. And there's a lot, I mean,
*  there's going to be a lot of work to do.
*  Wow. All right. So chemists are going to be fully employed by this job.
*  Yes, I think toxicology and then medical, you know, there's tons of stuff, but I also think,
*  you know, my chemistry background too, working in analytical, I, you know, did, you know, image
*  analysis and video, which seems a bit odd, but then, you know, how photography works, how digital
*  data works and how things are stored, you know, an image is in some ways an image is an image.
*  So if you have, you know, a camera that's hooked up to a microscope versus a security camera,
*  how do those work? What does the data mean? How do you retrieve the data? And so I think just like
*  in a lot of other fields where, you know, you can translate the skills you've learned to this maybe
*  new application or looked a bit tangent. Yeah. You can do the same thing. Definitely.
*  And it's not just, you know, figuring out how a murder was done or who did it. There's
*  presumably a lot of chemistry involved in things like finding the body or, you know, analyzing old
*  cases and old scenes. Oh yeah. I do want, one thing I do want to say is that I don't, you know,
*  it was never my job to solve anything. That's definitely a big thing. It's like, that's the
*  police's job, right? But we, you know, you might say, okay, is this possible? And the thing would
*  be like, yeah, you know, or provide some data. But I think with, yeah, I mean, I think some of the
*  most interesting stuff that comes out is trying to find like clandestine grapes and how do you
*  find when people have been moved or if people had been there. And so trying to develop, you know,
*  chemical tests and of course, geologists do this as far as, you know, types of imaging and trying
*  to look at, and even, you know, different life scientists of how different plant growths and
*  then entomologists, what kind of bugs are there. They're trying to locate those things and trying
*  to map those. You would think, I mean, even I sometimes am like, is that a big problem that
*  we have a lot of clandestine grapes? And it turns out, yes. Or trying to find them.
*  So a clandestine grape, this is not supposed to be a grape.
*  Not supposed to be a grape. But yeah.
*  So it's like a dead body in your yard and you didn't tell anyone about it.
*  Yeah. And actually in LA, so we're in LA now and there's just a case that happened where
*  someone discovered a decaying skull in their backyard and then packed it up and brought it
*  to a police station. And the police at first, you know, this was just reported by LA Times,
*  I think it was yesterday and the police were like, that we thought it was a prank at first?
*  Because, you know, my thing is like, so if you find that, don't move it.
*  Don't move it, right.
*  You know, the police will come to your house.
*  It's possible you don't want the police to come to your house.
*  Right, right. And so I think that's the thing is, you know, sometimes there's those types of
*  endeavors or when you have missing people or, you know, and it could be, it could be historical.
*  I think there's also, you know, kind of historical forensics where you might be trying to investigate
*  a certain event and trying to really get, so now that again, technology advances and maybe
*  we can start, you know, finding certain mass graves or when, you know, certain sites that,
*  things that people thought would occur or sometimes there was a case that I wrote about
*  for my column that was like Renaissance era poisoning. Potentially that was the rumor.
*  That's a long time ago.
*  Oh yeah. And the rumor was, you know, this was the Medici's court in Florence, which
*  was just a hotbed. Scandal and activity and art and intrigue and all this stuff. And there was
*  this rumor that this, you know, these folks, philosophers and poets had been poisoned. And
*  in an odd way or a good way, I feel weird saying that, but there are certain poisons that just,
*  they stay with you. They stay, they're literally in the bone.
*  Okay.
*  Or in, you know, certain amounts that get preserved. And so it was really interesting work
*  that they did because they had baseline, say, arsenic levels that just take, you know,
*  because it's everywhere. That's a naturally occurring element. And it can be in drinking
*  water. It can just be around. So there's that really small baseline quantity. And so they had
*  that kind of environmental background of what was kind of just present at the time.
*  Arsenic is not some complicated molecule. It's an element. One atom.
*  And so, you know, they have that baseline and you can get that in a lot of ways. You know,
*  we have a lot of artifacts in that period. I mean, the stuff is just literally everywhere.
*  But then, you know, they did some interesting work where they found that for definitely for
*  one of the two courtiers, the amounts that they then found were like, way beyond what they found
*  in kind of separate remains that would have just been more like, yeah, this is pretty standard.
*  And it's, you know, again, maybe then the leap of saying this was a malicious poisoning,
*  that's a legal law enforcement thing. But when you look at the levels and you go, wow.
*  And they were the Medici work.
*  You know, does that mean that it's a criminal? You know, I mean, again, we're also talking about
*  an era where you could, you know, and even much after that, you could go to a pharmacy slash
*  chemist and pick up stuff that nowadays you're like, I'm sorry, you could do what? You could
*  just go to the pharmacist and pick up.
*  The rules were looser back then.
*  Shrink 9 and cyanide and, you know, and so it's hard to say, but the levels are interesting to
*  be like, yeah, so that's someone needs to explain. I mean, it's more about, you know,
*  what's the reasonable explanation that that's not just casual.
*  Well, we tell stories about Medici's and, you know, it's kind of fun, palace intrigue stuff,
*  but are we exaggerating or was there really that much poisoning going on?
*  I feel, you know, it's when you look back on those things, you know, people always say now that,
*  you know, oh, this, you know, kids these days are nowadays. And I'm like,
*  there was some stuff going on, right between the Borja's and the Medici's and, you know,
*  this the stories that you hear. But then, I mean, that is that become almost integrated
*  into historical lore. And that's why, you know, sometimes these folks that go back and if you look
*  at like the Egyptian houses in the upper and lower Egypt, that, you know, what is that with great
*  power comes great responsibility. I think with great power also comes great shenanigans.
*  And there's just a lot of, you know, potentially things that have gone on.
*  And part of it is, you know, wow, really, you know, like, I remember the first time I heard
*  about the Borja's, I was like, oh, scandal. You know, and again, we think that that's very
*  modern. Right. Some of these things. No, it goes back. Oh, yeah. And I think, you know,
*  the kind of the nicknames that things get like arsenic, like inheritance powder.
*  That's how common it was. You know, when you think of your inheritance process,
*  when you think about those things, or, you know, hemlock and and Belladonna, and, you know,
*  strychnine and you think about all these things and how easy they were to get.
*  And how, you know, so and so's uncle or whatever had a, you know, gastro, you know, distress and
*  then, you know, took a long time. And, you know, this is also an Agatha Christie device of, you
*  know, sometimes it is artistic and sometimes art is just mirroring that, you know, yes, so and so,
*  aunt, whatever, did have an eight month long illness and then died and then so and so inherited
*  inherited the house or, you know, some small bequeath. But yeah, but then a lot of times you
*  look back at the old newspapers and you realize that that is like the whole, the law and order.
*  I always loved the tradition, you know, the old school law and order where it says, you know,
*  or even in SVU now, it says that little proviso of, you know, this is not, I mean, it may be
*  similar, but this is, you know, ripped from the headlines and actually, and you realize we've been
*  doing that for a long time, you know, and some of these cases, you're like, that hits a little too
*  close to home. Right? Well, this is good. Let's switch gears from being the investigators to being
*  the perpetrators. Let's put ourselves in the mindsets of the perpetrators so we can maybe
*  working our way historically works here. Like if so, if you were back in ancient times, what were
*  the good ways to off your nemeses? You know, besides just like bludgeoning. Yeah, let's say
*  we were a little more subtle. Maybe you didn't want to be caught. That's the great thing about
*  poison, right? Is it is at least presumably back in 2000 years ago, if you bludgeoned someone,
*  it's pretty noticeable, but maybe you could poison someone and no one would know. And I think that
*  that's the, you know, when you have some of the classic quote old school poisonings, they've been
*  around for a long time, your hemlock, your your belladonna. So what you want, I mean, that
*  presumably the trick is you want something that the person imbibing it wouldn't know about.
*  Wouldn't know about it. Not too strong a taste. Of course, how do you know it doesn't have too
*  strong a taste? You don't want to taste it. Well, I mean, that's where the, you know, the kind of
*  folklore and legend and people, I mean, that's the that's the other really interesting thing is
*  when it comes to poisons, the certain things, again, that people think are kind of quote,
*  modern inventions, poisons, abortifactids, birth control attempts. This has all been well documented
*  in in texts. I mean, as soon as people could be writing down things, they were either writing
*  down, you know, how to kill, how to not get pregnant, how to terminate a pregnancy, or,
*  you know, oh, wait, we need to write down some laws, you know, you know, these types of and
*  bills of sale, I think we're I think the the the historical folks would be like, no, no, no, bills
*  of sale scheme for, you know, like those kind of tracking things. But all of that, when you look
*  back at some of these, you know, some of our earliest greatest, you know, scientific texts, and
*  again, at the time, it was the best they could do because you read some of the things now and
*  you're like, that would never have worked. But, you know, there was a lot of information. And
*  sometimes again, it was observed that so and so ate this plant that was grown by the river and
*  Yeah.
*  And so unfortunately, and so that's why like that kind of information, but poisons, certain types
*  of poisons have been known for a very long time. And people have been killing each other with
*  poisons in one way or another, whether literally chemical or biological. Also, you know, and being
*  intentional and trying to infect people, you know, I mean, people were flinging rotting corpses over
*  wells and, you know, leaving dead rats and water wells and trying to do different things and also
*  just kind of both poisoning for a long, long time. And one of the Yeah, one of the things we hear
*  about is carrying poison, not just through ingestion, but you know, through a garment or
*  a weapon or something like that. How plausible are those? Pretty plausible. I mean, you know,
*  we've got I mean, most folks know about like Harari and darts and arrows and things like that.
*  And also, you know, lots of Greek mythology and ancient plays, you know, we'll talk about like a
*  poison dress, the poison dress trope is really popular of, you know, kind of saturating fabric
*  and having it somehow, you know, and also like a metaphor of having it be beautiful and then having
*  it kill you and that you covenant the person who wore the dress would be the victim of the
*  Yeah. And sometimes, you know, or any garment could be a dress could be, you know, France garment could
*  be kind of reminds me, you know, and even the crown. So even, you know, Game of Thrones a bit,
*  and it wasn't really a poison. It was hot molten gold. But like you lust for something, and you
*  covenant so much symbolic. There's a symbolic element aspect. Yeah. But you know, when you read
*  some of these plays like Medea, and you go, so that and that again, didn't come from nowhere.
*  And what happened in Medea? So again, the poison, the poison dress trope, where it kind of actually
*  reads a bit like, like a napalm. And then when you think about open flames, and how, you know,
*  and even flammable fabrics were have always historically been a problem for ladies, as far
*  as the types of materials dresses are made out of and the fact that there were so much fabric
*  for certain folks, and that, you know, lighting devices were literally open flames.
*  Yeah, everything. So, you know, this kind of danger of that, and the visualization of that whole
*  thing, you know, but even in a more artistic way to make a statement like hunger game, right,
*  that whole visualization. But when you think about there's lots of routes of exposure, you know,
*  there's there's ingestion, there's gas, there's like through the skin. And so there's a lot of
*  methods. And that also, you know, is interesting. And historically, it goes way back, could have
*  been something that you were touched, could have again, like clothes, you know, and you saw that
*  the danger to like World War One, which is called the chemist war, some of the
*  It's not really called that by anyone who's not a chemist.
*  Right. Unless you're a historian, maybe you call it the chemist war. But also some of the challenges
*  with some of the earliest nerve agents and and today is that they persist in the environment and
*  on your clothes. Well, you know, if you're in a theater of war, you can't really start running
*  around taking all your clothes off. I mean, even in a lab environment, like lab safe, anyone who's
*  been through lab training knows that, you know, if you spill something on yourself, you got to use,
*  you know, shower. But the first, you know, you're actually supposed to take off this garment,
*  because it's keeping it against yourself. And so that that's definitely based in history or fact
*  again, with some flair and you know, the ancient Greeks really did love their flair when it came
*  to their tragedies. So yeah, that's definitely rooted in.
*  Do you think that it was an impetus for early chemistry, the desire to kill people in more
*  creative, interesting ways? I think finding out, I think it's fun. It's funny because, you know,
*  when you think about maybe the history of chemistry, but in specific analytical chemistry
*  was to test currency. You know, you're talking about time where currency or things that you
*  could trade, you had to prove they were the chemical composition they were, is it gold?
*  Is it silver? And for a long time, salt was considered a currency and you could trade in
*  barter because it was so damn expensive. And we don't think of it nowadays because it's like
*  laughably cheap. You can buy like a bucket of it for like a dollar. But is it what it actually is,
*  this thing that you've attached huge value to. And that's one big thing. And then of course,
*  the other one is we got to find out why people keep dying. And so I've been important question.
*  I feel like, you know, in analytical, there's definitely this kind of you're trying to,
*  you know, again, solve mysteries of either is this thing what we say it is,
*  because either it's going to be the foundation of an entire economy, which can cause the entire
*  thing to collapse if the gold isn't gold. Or we have such a problem with proving goods are what
*  they are, which again, is a foundation of economy. Or again, like the poisoning thing, and Deborah
*  Bloom did a great job in her book Poisoners Handbook of tracking why that was such a thing,
*  because, again, in the foundation of society, I mean, the poisonings are, were not that common,
*  that it was literally every, but it's the confidence. And it's the security of society,
*  which is very tenuous, and doesn't take a lot of criminal behavior.
*  No, I had a great podcast with Neha Nerula talking about digital money. And you know,
*  first you have to agree that it's money, right? And digital currencies are struggling with that
*  right now. So the perception of safety and security, whether it's in the economy or your
*  person, that a lot of the earliest chemical tests were based solely on that, on a level of
*  protection and community and security of, you know, what does that mean? Because we've had to all
*  agree and trust. Right. And yet trust can be violated. Yeah. And so once we get to the
*  Renaissance, if you're Lucretia Borgia, you have an annoying cousin, what do you do? Like, how do
*  I go shopping for poison? Oh, yeah. Or do I need to make it myself? Well, or you'd have your right
*  hand person. But also, you know, your apothecaries and your thing, and I think there's always been,
*  right? There's always been a challenge of what is that old proverb, the only way to keep,
*  only way three people can keep a secret is if two of them are dead. You know, the more co-conspirators
*  that you have. And so sure, if you can do it yourself and keep your own counsel,
*  to also, but I think that's actually a biblical phrase, keep your own counsel,
*  then that would be, you know, better in that. And so, you know, some of these folks were actually
*  quite good. But also, you know, the important thing to remember is at the same time that these
*  things are lethal and poisonous, a lot of the same things were in cosmetics, in smaller quantities,
*  they were considered medicinal, it would not be uncommon, especially in an affluent household.
*  You know, when we think of like, I'm going to open my medicine cabinet, and I've got acetaminophen,
*  and aspirin, and antacids, and like nine types of band-aids of various sizes, and I've got ointments,
*  like, you have like this whole spread, especially in a big household. Well, that was, again,
*  the equivalent of that. Equivalent of that would have been, it would not have been uncommon to have
*  some of these things. And then also think about pest control, which was also, you know, kind of
*  a big deal. And also that, you know, the beginning of understanding the pest role and disease and
*  all of that. But it wasn't also uncommon to get rid of vermin just because they ate your food.
*  And even if the disease link came later, you knew they were eating your food, they were eating
*  through your clothes, they were, you know, they were just pests. And so how do you get rid of them?
*  Okay. So it was totally not uncommon for people to have buckets of the craziest stuff in their house,
*  or to also be using it in some much smaller quantity in a medicinal way, again, whether it
*  worked or not. This sounds like a very 1800s kind of thing to me. Like, was that the high point for
*  ingesting crazy substances as potential miracle cures? Oh, no, it can go much earlier. You know,
*  and it's kind of fun to go to museums, and you'll see these, you know, chests of things,
*  and you realize that especially again, the more affluent the house, or whatever the equivalent
*  would be of, you know, middle class, and up and even, even more precarious socio economic positions,
*  there were, you know, kind of the community medicinal chest, right, or things people had access to
*  what kinds of things. So, you know, you just had to say, so different herbs, and some of the things
*  that we would think now are like, oh, so basil, right, or your flavoring agents, or things like
*  that, or peppermint, different mints that were soothing on the stomach, or let me do a combination
*  of, you know, a little bit of mint with penny royal and add in, you know, these kind of concoctions
*  that you'd inherited from, you know, grandma, whoever, and it just seemed to work. And again,
*  the fun thing is from a natural products thing, there's a lot of things that you carried forward,
*  and you're like, that actually did work. And so we're gonna now make it and manufacture it. And
*  it's aspirin. So some of these things, and people go back to, there's a whole, you know, area of
*  scholarship where people go back into historical tests and try to figure out what was this thing,
*  and then test it, you know, against modern or historic diseases and see that, hey, it really did.
*  Like, you know, even on a weird way, honey and mummification, antibacterial properties in honey,
*  I mean, it wasn't just this, it wasn't a weird thing, or because it was sticky, like it actually,
*  it served. Sorry, I didn't know that honey played a huge role in mummification. Is that true?
*  Yeah, a little bit. There's lots of different types of mummification protocols. But some protocols,
*  actually, a thin layer of honey. And it did help keep down some of the little bacteria friends from
*  getting a bit out of control. That's crazy to me, because it seems like it's sweet and nutritious,
*  and it would attract all sorts of crazy things. But it's jam-packed, full. I mean, it's another
*  chemical. It's just, you know, the things like honey and coffee, we just don't think about
*  of what they contain. And it's a thousand chemicals. And, you know, it's got all kinds
*  of stuff in there. You know, it's an animal product, honey. You've got all kinds of cool
*  stuff in there that could be serving some really interesting purpose. Like, what are the animals
*  doing with it? I'm not sure that they're making it so that I can have it on my toast. Right? You know,
*  so there's some really interesting, and again, it's an active area of scholarship. You know,
*  in some of the plants that are, you know, that people grow, oh, it's ornamental, it might be
*  poisonous, or it's ornamental. And it seems like, you know, if I place it here, it keeps down these
*  types of pests and insects. Well, it's, you know, releasing this volatile organic chemical. And
*  there's really something in that that people have known about. And gardeners, you know,
*  it's not an accident that these very elaborate gardens that were planned out, plants were where
*  they were. And it wasn't just because they looked cool. You know, when you talk to, you know, or
*  you read these old historical documents, you realize, oh, that's why they're trying to keep
*  down pests or trying to attract certain things or, you know, certain gardens place certain things
*  there. Because if you weren't well, you would want your medicinal garden close to the house.
*  You weren't going to have to like, hike out. And so like, some of that knowledge, now we just,
*  again, we have better tools that we can kind of find or dismiss, you know, certain things.
*  And I think that's kind of the fun part is that you can look back and say, okay, well, that
*  explains it. Or you're like, I have no idea why everyone was sprinkling arsenic in there.
*  Yeah, why? Why were you people doing that? Well, nowadays, we presumably know a lot more.
*  Would we be able to commit the perfect crime with our chemistry knowledge now? Hypothetically,
*  of course, we're not advocating anything here. You know, whenever and I do, I've done some panels,
*  we've, you know, how to commit the perfect murder and things like that. And it's funny,
*  because I never think it comes with planning in that way, in the perfect murder weapon,
*  because sometimes even chemicals like succinylcholine, which is a really scary
*  agent, it's a medical purpose. If it's used, it's probably because you're going to be intubated.
*  Okay.
*  And it works on a certain type of muscle, where completely it's going to paralyze it. Unfortunately,
*  type of muscles are also the ones that help you breathe. However, if you need intubation,
*  they need to get that tube down your throat, like there's that and you're going to, it's all very
*  well coordinated. But if you use it for nefarious purposes, it goes very, very bad. And for a long
*  time, you know, it was such an odd poison to use as a poison. You know, again, we have the ones that
*  we've developed a lot of tests for, that we know what they look like. These are the symptoms.
*  Our tests, you know, we've got very simple tests. They're going to be the first run, like arsenic,
*  you know, say carbon monoxide, cherry, you know, your skin turns like a cherry red.
*  There's other types of drugs that would cause cyanosis, your skin would turn blue.
*  But something like succinylcholine is such a weird, I mean, it's a very specific application. It's not,
*  you know, one of the heavy hitter poisons, the historical poisons that it literally isn't found,
*  wasn't found. I mean, now it's been, you know, the jig is up. Because it just was
*  not commonly used. So I guess that you could at one time that was that really went under the
*  radar and you could get away with some stuff because nobody was looking for it.
*  I mean, so if you're poisoning somebody, you might want a chemical that disappears from the body.
*  Rapid metabolism, which, which succinylcholine, that can be an issue. Another one would be some
*  of your, say your drug facilitated crime molecules, like scopronamine, which I wrote about recently,
*  where, again, not only does it, is it an issue because the metabolism can be fast, but one of
*  its effects is memory loss. And it affects your ability. So by the time you might even realize,
*  or even if you do, that maybe I should seek medical attention three days later and, you know,
*  whether a metabolite could be found or which metabolites, I mean that, so the drug's action
*  itself limits its ability to be found. And that's a big, but that's, you know, there's a whole area
*  of scholarship, you know, going with that one and, you know, really seeking out. So every new
*  drug or new poison, you know, requires another set of people like myself who develop a method.
*  Like it's a race. It's a race against time. You know, somebody comes up with something and you've
*  got to find a test for it. So today's perfect murder is tomorrow's, you know, easily solved crime,
*  but you gotta keep ahead of the curve. Same thing with inheritance pattern. I mean, sure,
*  I got that nickname, but for a lot of times people were able to get away with some really,
*  you know, outrageous stuff and then you develop the test.
*  So a lot of these, even if they disappear from the body because they're metabolized,
*  they have some other effect on, you know, like you turn red, like you said.
*  There could be other effect, but even if they're metabolized, as long as we, you know,
*  the other important area of scholarship is really understanding that metabolism. Because even if you
*  can't find the parent compound anymore, you can find all of its little metabolites in certain
*  ratios. And then it's like, it's indirect, but it's very good evidence. And there's tons of those.
*  And so again, that's a good, it's the application of building a technique does depend on that good
*  old, not even old fashioned, that clinical metabolism really getting the mechanism and the
*  why so that you can build a better test. And it all, you know, to me, it all comes together
*  full circle of I'm an applied scientist, but the reason I can build better tests is I have to
*  understand the basic research in the clinical applications and the roots in order to get to
*  the point where the little test that everyone takes for granted that it's so simple.
*  It comes back to the science.
*  It always comes back to that.
*  You wrote this wonderful little snippet in one of your columns that is relevant here.
*  With its red color bubbles and sweetness, cherry lambrini is a popular tipple. It is also a good
*  disguise for the sweet killer ethylene glycol.
*  Oh, one of my favorites. Ethylene glycol was another one that for a long time went under the radar
*  and antifreeze.
*  Is it antifreeze or is it antifreeze?
*  It is antifreeze.
*  Oh, okay.
*  And so of course, you know, easily obtained.
*  I mean, you can buy literally gallons of it.
*  Now, you know, the reason why too, it's not actually that weird green color.
*  They color it because they're like, hey, don't drink this.
*  It's antifreeze, right? Because it's incredibly dangerous.
*  And of course, the danger like that is that it's very sweet, like lead acetate.
*  It's a very sweet thing.
*  And so how you disguise it if you're trying to poison someone, much like say one of the,
*  a lot of also plant based poisons are alkaloids and they can taste very bitter.
*  And so where do you hide it?
*  And so that's why, of course, even in cinema, you see a lot of these poisons in red wine.
*  Or elaborate cocktails.
*  Or elaborate, yeah.
*  Sweet and bitter.
*  Carpani or some kind of thing where it's like you're going to-
*  Antifreeze Negroni.
*  You know, you're going to, I mean, but antifreeze would be so sweet that that kind of cocktail.
*  There was a big case where it was hidden in like a propel or like a Gatorade.
*  Because Gatorade is also can be sweet.
*  Well, would you want to hide it in something else that was sweet?
*  Or do you want to balance it?
*  Maybe I'm thinking more of a mixologist rather than a killer.
*  Right.
*  And I think that that is your first mistake.
*  No. But you want like.
*  Be a terrible murderer.
*  You want like, right?
*  If you're expecting sweet.
*  Like this husband and wife.
*  You know, I mean, like my wedding toast.
*  This is a real case.
*  My go-to wedding toast is may your marriage never be described as perfect by dateline.
*  Because then you know.
*  Until.
*  But in this case, I mean, it's such a sweet beverage that adding, you know, a little bit.
*  Little bit of antifreeze.
*  Isn't, it's going to disguise it.
*  You wouldn't want to add something like strychnine.
*  Right.
*  It's too weird.
*  Somebody would drink it.
*  First of all, there's, you know, the white powder.
*  You'd really have to work to get it dissolved.
*  But also that bitterness would seem odd.
*  Right.
*  So if a friend was a Negroni drinker, I'm not going to put antifreeze in it.
*  Right.
*  Because the minute it hits the palate.
*  So sweet.
*  It's off.
*  They were like, well, who made this?
*  Yeah.
*  And they dump it.
*  And, you know, and so part of it is you want to do like dissolves like.
*  And of course you have the really dangerous ones that are colorless.
*  Odourless tasteless, which of course is dangerous for the person.
*  And maybe just what the doctor ordered for the villain.
*  So there's a known list of those things.
*  There's actually a nice little review article about, you know, the seven most about seven
*  common homicide poisonings.
*  Okay.
*  And, you know, it's weird or it's not weird, but just like everything else, things are in vogue.
*  Yeah.
*  Things are not in vogue.
*  Right.
*  You know, so, and again, it also becomes of how easy it is to get.
*  Sure.
*  Again.
*  Because you don't want to arouse suspicion.
*  You know, I mean, that's part of a good old fashioned gumshoe intelligence police work.
*  Right.
*  It just amassing information.
*  And there was a really old case that involves strychnine where a person went to, you know,
*  you could just go to a store and buy it.
*  Because again, for pests, if getting rid of rats and I mean, it's.
*  It's still utilized in these kind of poisoned wheat, sprinkle it around.
*  And so the shop owner was like, yeah, you did come in and you did buy that and you bought it.
*  One month, you know, and that, and that was, you know, that was almost 200 years ago.
*  So, I mean, and then of course there was 150 years.
*  Yeah, there was 150 years ago.
*  And then there was a test, you know, there was a beginning, these preliminary
*  tests of looking at these things.
*  Then there, there was that and they discovered that.
*  But again, of the tests were done later, right?
*  The tests are always, you know, later than you just went and you,
*  you went to every place that sold it.
*  You looked on the farm and yep, yep.
*  She was here last Wednesday.
*  You know, that's the, you know, the good old fashioned kind of gumshoe stuff.
*  And even, I think that's the thing is that even when you have the tests,
*  people are still going to want to, but where did they get it?
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of, we live in a world where there's a lot of records that are left.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like everything we do.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So it's becoming harder and harder to commit a good murder.
*  Yeah. And I think, you know, the records, so when people ask me about, you know,
*  committing a perfect crime and some really elaborate scheme,
*  I think the better thing to do is that when, when people have.
*  Keep it simple, stupid.
*  Yeah. We've gotten away with something, quote unquote.
*  It's really a kind of sometimes a perfect storm of incompetence.
*  Sometimes if I've just low response time, certain things weren't collected.
*  That should have been, you know, the, the, the, maybe the,
*  maybe the investigative officers made mistakes or there were accidents
*  or again, there could have been some level of professional incompetence.
*  The prosecuting attorney declines.
*  I mean, there's, there's almost like a perfect storm of things that can occur
*  where it's, you couldn't plan for that though, unless you literally did the investigation of
*  like, it needs to be on the corner of Sepulveda and like at this time of night,
*  between a shift change, like, and then you, that almost, how did you find out?
*  Do you know, the pulling your Google search records and that kind of stuff.
*  And so it can be the more you plan, the plan reveals your malfeasance.
*  That's true. That's a good point. Yeah.
*  But some other, I, sometimes I get mail from prisoners who want like me to give them a free
*  copy of my book or something like that because they can't get it in prison.
*  And part of me wants to help them out, of course, because they're in prison and they
*  want to improve themselves. But, but when you get mail from prisoners, it always includes their
*  prisoner number and you can go and look up what they did. And so far, the ones I've gotten,
*  it's not like, you know, mail fraud, like this really bad things that these people did.
*  This one guy, it pretty clear that he killed his grandmother and like they never found her body.
*  She disappeared and from staying with him and things like that. But you know, he got,
*  he got in prison for a related thing, but they never found her body. I mean, how do you get
*  rid of the body? That's the other thing. Like once I've committed the perfect crime.
*  You got a lot of options. But you know, there's also weaknesses. Body transport can be where you
*  get caught. You know, there's, there's the key, key cases where moving people and or bodies is when
*  you got pulled over for that broken taillight. And so there's, you know, those taillights get
*  broken anyway. Or speeding or a parking fine or, you know, something like that. And so, but then,
*  okay, you move it, then you've upped the number of people that see you. And especially now with
*  CCTV and parking garages and just the street and stoplights. And, and, you know, one of the first
*  things that folks will do is they'll pull cameras from as many locations as they can, and someone's
*  going to have to sit through it all. So all of the, literally just the transport can be hard.
*  And also I would advise, because this is actually a real case, don't Google best disposal spites.
*  In Los Angeles County. Can you go to the dark web and, you know, do this without leaving it?
*  Just saying maybe. But also, you know, again, it's are you going to bury it in your house? Are
*  you going to transport? And that's it. You know, that time leaves you open and vulnerable. There
*  was a different case where someone bought, like disposal type things, and they paid cash, but they
*  went to a store with cameras. And then for some reason, they wanted to use their club card so
*  they could get a discount. Again, you cannot make these things up. Human behavior.
*  There's a selection of fact that these are the ones we've caught.
*  Right. But you know, on the other hand, but I think, you know, there's, there's chemical
*  disposal methods, right? Acid or base, there's fire, you know, trying to obliterate it that way.
*  There is, you know, I'm going to- It would seem very difficult to
*  incinerate a body if you didn't have the right equipment.
*  Oh, no, you can do it. I think that-
*  Dry it out first.
*  I think time and, and, you know, where you're at and how hot you can get things. It might shorten
*  the time. So if you're out, if you're in a cabin in the woods, this might be a way to go.
*  Maybe, but then, you know, why is there a huge smoke thing coming from that person's? I mean,
*  I think there's always, you know, that you can't, what you can't plan for is someone that decided to
*  do them and their friend hike past your remote cabin and see you carrying that thing rolled up
*  in a carpet out to the bonfire. Right. You know, and even, even the cases where, and in, in recent
*  years you've had, you know, it used to be the, the, the cliche was no body, no crime. You know,
*  it was at one time harder to prosecute those things, but almost with the advent of as much data
*  and how everything, you know, is, is kind of logged and you have to kind of access certain records,
*  you know, unless this person is totally ghosted, everyone, and then gone completely off the grid,
*  which is really, really hard to do. They're dead. Right. And that's not a, and then you look at the
*  person's behavior and how they would, you know, kind of carry on their life. And if there's,
*  they're not accessing their bank card. They didn't do a major withdrawal. They're not,
*  their credit cards aren't being used. Their car is still there. I mean, all of these things,
*  then it's reasonable to conclude something has occurred. And so with it again, like again,
*  with the, the ramp up of technology and sometimes, you know, the, there are concerns about privacy
*  and things like that are legitimate, but at the same time, it's like, you know, maybe a couple,
*  100 years ago, maybe even 50 or 60 years ago, people would have been like, nobody, no crimes.
*  But now it's like no digital signature means that Aunt Glenda, you know, that's not, is that,
*  you know, it's just so hard to do that.
*  But the saving grace is that the crime labs are backed up by months or years, right? Does that
*  make it easier?
*  I mean, I think that, I think that that's the other challenge, right? So, you know, the, again,
*  that's a practical administration problem. And, and we've seen, unfortunately, we've seen that
*  manifest itself, especially with sexual assault test kits and with sexual limitations where you're
*  talking warehouses full of kits. And there was a great bunch of work where they-
*  With kits that have just not been analyzed.
*  Analyzed, because again, the backlog, the cost, combination of those factors. But when they've
*  gotten the funds and actually gone through and there was, I believe it was in Michigan,
*  they did all of this work analysis because they got this funding and they were able to process
*  all these, you know, backlog kits. And they found a number of serial predators.
*  And, you know, when you, you look at the data, again, you come back to the data and you look at
*  these numbers and you look at the, I mean, again, I'm not, I'm not over saying it when I'm saying
*  warehouses full of stuff, that it's just, again, they, you get away with it, not because you
*  didn't leave evidence behind, but because of, you know, limitations in staff, instruments,
*  budgets. And it's, it's shocking and somehow so ordinary to say that, but that absolutely influences
*  like every other type of analysis. It absolutely influences what you can do.
*  Sure. You know, I always like to end on a more or less optimistic note, and that was not it.
*  Whereas we, as we wrap things up, you know, I did want to say, like, I hope that most of your
*  students go into lives of fighting crime rather than committing. They seem prepared for either
*  one, but, you know, presumably the ones who are best prepared would be good at either one.
*  But are we, is it, is it an exciting frontier for chemistry now in catching bad guys in better and
*  better ways? I think I like to think of it maybe as, as keeping us safe. And there's, again,
*  not just catching bad guys, but I think also the things that we think about are just, you know,
*  kind of workplace contaminants or environmental accidents or, you know, as, you know, let someone
*  who lives in Austin, Texas, we just had this boil water notice. What was that?
*  Boil water notice. There was a- Boil the water?
*  You had to boil all the water because the processing plants weren't able to function
*  at the way they could. And when again, like a storm or, you know, again, a hurricane, you know,
*  it doesn't have to be malfeasant. And so when I think about my students and even the work I do,
*  which would still be forensic, even if it's not, you know, duplicitous, is that it's in the business
*  of keeping us safe and being able to have confidence in the things that we take for granted,
*  our food and our drink and our air. And I think that being able to have the skill set to keep,
*  you know, yourself safe or at least be able to look at the data and make good choices,
*  I feel like you're giving, you're empowering folks. And so that's kind of how I look at what I do
*  rather than the opposite of catching bad guys. Most people don't want to kill people or even
*  catch bad people that just want to live their lives. They just want to-
*  They just want to- Yeah.
*  And this is helping them. They want to drink their water and eat their kale smoothies and no,
*  and their bacon. They want to feel, you know, and so that's how I look at it is, is, you know,
*  even though the CSI and the forensic stuff is, you know, sexy and people find it interesting,
*  for the most part, what we do is, is this mundane stuff that you just want to be able to,
*  you know, your milk is going to be good, your water is safe to drink, and, you know, you've got a safe
*  train station to walk through with no contaminants. I mean, that's really- So in some small way,
*  I think a lot of scientists, you know, in general, I think a lot of scientists are,
*  I just want to help people, whatever small way that is.
*  Yeah. And we're thankful for it. Ray Burks, thanks so much for being on the podcast.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
