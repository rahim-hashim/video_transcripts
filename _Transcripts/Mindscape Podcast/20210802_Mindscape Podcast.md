The arrow of time — all the ways in which the past differs from the future — is a fascinating subject because it connects everyday phenomena (memory, aging, cause and effect) to deep questions in physics and philosophy. At its heart is the fact that entropy increases over time, which in turn can be traced to special conditions in the early universe. David Wallace is one of the world’s leading philosophers working on the foundations of physics, including space and time as well as quantum mechanics. We talk about how increasing entropy gives rise to the arrow of time, and what it is about the early universe that makes this happen. Then we cannot help but connecting this story to features of the Many-Worlds (Everett) interpretation of quantum mechanics.

David Wallace received a D.Phil. in Physics and a D.Phil. in Philosophy from Oxford University. He is currently W.A. Mellon Professor of Philosophy of Science, with joint appointments in the Philosophy Department and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, at the University of Pittsburgh. He is the author of The Emergent Multiverse: Quantum Theory According to the Everett Interpretation. Among his honors are the Lakatos Award for outstanding contribution to the philosophy of science. His most recent book is Philosophy of Physics: A Very Short Introduction.

# Mindscape 158 | David Wallace on The Arrow of Time
**Mindscape Podcast:** [August 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZusCQdM6ovw)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. The passage of time, it gets to us all, doesn't it?
*  I've been doing this podcast for over three years now. I remember almost everyone that I've done. Actually, I remember everyone.
*  But I don't remember any of the ones that I haven't yet done.
*  There's an asymmetry, right, in my memory between the podcasts that I've already done in the past and the podcasts yet to come in the
*  future, not because there aren't any in the future, but because of some feature of the way that time works in our universe, the arrow of time, pointing from the past to the future that gives it that imbalance.
*  And this is one of my favorite topics to think about in physics and philosophy. And the amazing thing is, we haven't really talked about it here on the podcast yet. We did talk about time, the psychology and neuroscience of time with Dean Bonamano, but the physics and philosophy of the arrow of time, which was the subject of my
*  first trade book from eternity to here, we haven't talked about yet. Also surprising is that we have not yet had David Wallace on the podcast. David is one of the leading philosophers of physics in the world today.
*  The third surprising thing is that we're having David on and we're not talking that much about the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. David is most famous for being probably the person who has thought most carefully about how many worlds should work in the real world.
*  I encourage you to check out his book, The Emergent Multiverse, if you really want to dig into the details. But David is broad in his interests in physics and philosophy. And he's certainly thought a lot about entropy and the arrow of time and the initial conditions of the universe and so forth.
*  That's what we're going to be mostly talking about today. How are all these different things related in, you know, the typical good philosopher, very, very careful way of teasing out what all the assumptions are, how they go into things.
*  I know that I found by talking to people that the arrow of time is one of the hardest things to think about in a reasonable way, just because this idea that the past flows into the future is so deeply embedded in how we think about the world.
*  That the idea that it's something that has to be explained and that you're not allowed to cheat when you explain it is a hard one to wrap your mind around. But David is very, very good at it. And guess what?
*  By the end of the podcast, we are in fact talking about the Everett Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics because it has a relationship to the arrow of time. The universe branches into multiple copies of itself going forward in time, not going backward.
*  So I think this is a classic upcoming episode here of the Mindscape Podcast, and you're all going to enjoy it. So let's go.
*  David Wallace, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Great to be here. You know, we're we've had some philosophers on the podcast before. In fact, philosophers of science, in fact, philosophers who started out as physicists and then turned into science, like our friend David Albert, for example.
*  But but nevertheless, I thought it would be fun to start by just asking you about that transition, you know, very quickly before we get into the mean potatoes of the thing. What is it that causes a person to sort of at one time in their lives think I want to be a physicist and at some other time think, you know, I'd really be happier doing philosophy.
*  Well, I think there's a bunch of people who get into physics and then gradually start thinking that a more philosophical way of exploring things is more interesting and they want to move in that direction. I'm not that kind of person at all. I still want to do physics.
*  Largely, I still think I do do physics. The kind of work I do is interdisciplinary. And I think relatively mundane facts about the way Britain and America organize their universities mean that for the kind of physics, or interdisciplinary stuff I was interested in, staying in a physics department and trying to do that work wouldn't have been the smartest career move.
*  Right. Yeah, so I kind of finished my PhD in physics with a bunch of research interests that were kind of in various foundational things quantum field theory, the Everest interpretation, and it looked pretty clear that I'd probably be able to get postdocs that way relatively easily because everyone says they love it.
*  And when I started looking for tenure trap positions, I'd be sure to luck. Right. So it was it was a fairly practical career move. I don't understate how, how cool academic philosophy is or say that I haven't developed lots of interests beyond that through exposure to it because I really have but it really did come down to that kind of I want to do I want to do this kind of physics, where can I do it? How can I do it?
*  I mean, it is a indictment, I think of the academic system, at least in the UK and the USA, which is the ones we're familiar with that the siloing is strong enough that there's there isn't a spectrum in between these right? I mean, you are either a philosopher or a physicist because you need to get paid, you need to get a job and that affects how people choose their research topics and things like that.
*  Yeah, yeah. And people like it is for new work in principle. But when it starts to be you want a permanent position, you have a teaching component, it gets hard. And I do think it's a genuinely hard problem to solve. I mean, one of the reasons foundational philosophical works tricky to do in a physics department is the criteria to measure it a hard.
*  So you've done an experiment, the experiment does what you said it did. You've done a calculation, the calculation can be checked, all that's fine. And harder to do that with foundational stuff. I mean, yes, we may know some genuinely bad stuff gets done in foundational spaces, which doesn't get caught by those kind of filters.
*  So I think it is an indictment, but I also do think it's a tricky problem to solve. And maybe one reason philosophy of physics works quite well as a space is philosophy is a bit better and knowing how to assess the quality, that kind of more conceptual oriented work.
*  That makes perfect sense. And actually, it leads very well into the meat and potatoes here because my own, I think I've said this before, but maybe not to you. You know, I was always interested in philosophy ever since I was an undergraduate, but the kinds of philosophy that I liked were actually moral and political philosophy, because the philosophy of science that I learned was all about theory choice and sociology of science and stuff like that, which is important and interesting, but it's not my bag. It wasn't until I was a grown cosmologist and thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early
*  university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, I was thinking about the early university, Kon gur CNIL, and basically, slowly.
*  through the arrow of time that I actually got interested in philosophical foundational
*  questions.
*  And so I thought it'd be fun to start talking about that before we get into the Everett
*  interpretation.
*  Sounds great.
*  The phrase the arrow of time, something people have heard, but then there's this feeling
*  that there are many arrows of time.
*  What is your take on is there an arrow of time?
*  Are there many?
*  What are they?
*  How do you define them?
*  The basic way I'd started getting at it is something about which processes in the world
*  run forwards and backwards just as happily and which processes don't.
*  So if you look at small systems, or not really even just at small systems, but if you look
*  at systems with not many moving parts, in physics they don't seem to care whether you
*  run them forward or backwards.
*  So if I showed you a video of the solar system and I speeded it up a bit and I asked you
*  whether I was running it forward or backward, I mean if you paid attention to whether the
*  sun rose in the east or the west or something, you could probably figure it out.
*  But it wouldn't be obvious.
*  The solar system's physics doesn't really mind if you run it forward or backward.
*  And that's just the same reason why the way we work out when the next eclipse is going
*  to be is just the same way we work out when the eclipses were in the classical era so
*  we can cross-reference it to Thucydides or something.
*  Most processes aren't like that.
*  Processes with lots of moving parts aren't like that.
*  If I show you a speeded up video of ice cube in water or the way I've got older over the
*  last 10 years or building collapsing or something, it's completely obvious whether I'm running
*  that video forward or backward.
*  So most processes in the world really distinguish between forward and backward dynamics and
*  yet big things are made out of small things.
*  So there's something extremely puzzling, kind of in the vicinity of a contradiction if you're
*  not careful, with the idea that big processes clearly distinguish forward and backward in
*  the dynamics, but they're made out of processes that themselves don't distinguish it.
*  Do you yourself like to rigorously categorize different arrows of time or do you just lump
*  it together as an arrow of time and different aspects of it?
*  Yeah, I'm kind of skeptical about a lot of that categorizing of different arrows.
*  I think people do talk about a statistical thermodynamic arrow and a cosmological arrow
*  and a memory arrow.
*  And I think the way you break those things up kind of presupposes structure that's not
*  necessarily there.
*  I don't think we should necessarily take it as read, the direction of time implied by
*  the fact that we remember the past, not the future, has the same origin as would be assumed
*  as the direction we get from the fact that ice melts and doesn't refreeze.
*  But if we just kind of silo them off, then we can kind of assume that we know how those
*  things break up in a way that isn't completely reliable.
*  And I think one way of seeing that actually is you start, if you want to check if two
*  things are logically independent, you want to try switching one of them off and leaving
*  the other one on and seeing if it makes sense.
*  If you try to imagine universes where you turn around, let's say, the direction in which
*  you remember things or the direction in which radiation decays, but you don't turn around
*  the direction in which ice melts, you very quickly have something you can't really imagine
*  when you start trying to think through the details in any length.
*  So in other words, just to sort of leap ahead to a big claim that we'll interrogate later,
*  you seem to be saying that in your view, there is one underlying thing that ultimately is
*  going to account for both why ice melts but doesn't unmelt and also for why we remember
*  the past but not the future.
*  Well, look, I reckon that's true.
*  But I'll do a slightly more sort of drawn back version for that.
*  I'm pretty sure that the reason that if there's a relation between those two, then the
*  direction of time in human cognition and action is what it is because of the direction of
*  time in physics and not vice versa.
*  So we ought to be able to figure out what's going on in the direction in the direction of
*  time in physics without having to presuppose a bunch of stuff from human cognition and
*  action.
*  If once we've done that, then I kind of strongly suspect that because humans are physical
*  systems, it's going to turn out that asymmetries in humans are a special case of these other
*  asymmetries.
*  But at the very least, we can figure out those asymmetries in physics without having to get
*  tangled up in these issues about asymmetries in us.
*  But this so this does presuppose and you're in a friendly crowd here, so it's OK, a kind of
*  physicalism, right?
*  I mean, we're not attributing human agency to something over and above the fact that we're
*  made of stuff.
*  So if we understand the asymmetries of the behavior of the stuff, the asymmetries of human
*  thought and cognition should follow along.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  There's a substantial assumption going on here.
*  And there's a sense in which I'm not even seriously defending it.
*  It's a bit too foundational to start defending.
*  And you might kind of draw it up like this.
*  There's this kind of approach I think you're calling physicalism.
*  Some places I just call it like dynamics first that says something like, OK, the the way we
*  manage our science is it's a dynamical description of what's going on independent of us.
*  It's as far as we interact with it that matters because it's how we test stuff and because we
*  want to understand us, too.
*  But the physics itself can be understood without and without consideration of the agent's
*  role. And there's a completely different tradition that says, well, the theories can't be
*  understood, except insofar as they are things to be used by theorizers and the role of the
*  theorizer can never be taken out completely.
*  So you'll never you'll never really understand the asymmetry of time in physics without
*  understanding there's an asymmetry in how we as agents get our systems.
*  Look, some some smart, reasonable people take that approach and it's and sometimes it bears
*  fruit. And there comes a time where I think it's less useful to just go around and round
*  every decreasing circles, try to persuade somebody who has that starting point that they're
*  wrong. And it makes more sense to pursue your own project and have it judged by its fruits.
*  That's right. If you succeed, then the good things will flow in your direction.
*  Right. OK, so I mean, you mentioned, I think very correctly that naively this asymmetry
*  of time evolution of big complicated things might be thought of as intention or even
*  contradictory to the symmetry of time evolution in things with small number of moving pieces.
*  Before we explain why, do you know much about the history?
*  Like, who's the first person who pointed out this was a puzzle?
*  So I should say lots of philosophers of physics are really good at the history of physics.
*  I'm not one of those philosophers, but I hang out with them a lot so I can do my attempted
*  secondhand version. I mean, back in the late 19th century, when Boltzmann was first trying to
*  write down mechanical theories of gases, these ideas were in the air and developing and there
*  was clearly a lot of confusion. And it's one of these quite delicate things to tease out exactly
*  who knew what, what, when. But roughly speaking, Boltzmann had a stab at doing an entirely
*  mechanical explanation of why gases expand and expand to fill the space they're in and why they
*  approach an equilibrium, a kind of stable, well behaved distribution of a certain kind.
*  And he kind of, at least on the natural reading of it, he wrote a paper that kind of tried to
*  just prove this mechanically. And then a bunch of people's, a mailer, Losschmidt pointed out like,
*  this is logically impossible. You started with some time reversible equations. You made some time
*  reversible assumptions about those equations and you got out something which distinguishes the past
*  and the future. This can't be done. And also you started with, this is a slightly subtle point,
*  but you started with some equations which reliably say that wherever system starts off,
*  it will eventually get back there. And you've derived the fact that the system will start
*  somewhere, go somewhere else and stay there forever. This cannot happen. So I think really
*  very early on, you know, before statistical mechanics was a properly developed discipline,
*  right? Right at the very first attempts to do this stuff, then people were very quickly seeing
*  that there was an issue there. I didn't think it was much before Boltzmann because you had to have
*  a realistic and detailed understanding of how the large came out to the small to get the worry off
*  the ground. I mean, I think Newton kind of liked the idea that there might be like an atomistic
*  basis for everything, but it was so embryonic at that point that I don't think anyone's serious,
*  that I'm aware of, seriously tried to think through what the possible issues were there.
*  Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm asking is just because I don't know the answer and I've kind
*  of wondered about this. I mean, I don't want to, you know, say too many things rather than asking
*  you to say them, but there is the second law of thermodynamics, which roughly says that entropy
*  increases and we can get into that, but it predates Boltzmann. Like Boltzmann gave an
*  explanation for it in terms of atoms and molecules bumping into each other. So I've always wondered,
*  you know, once they did come up, you know, Carnot and Clausius and people like that, they invented
*  the second law, manifestly not time reversible, right? I mean, it increases with time, it doesn't
*  decrease. And they also knew that there were Newton's laws of motion, like that was well known.
*  And so did anyone, was the idea that things like the second law were over and above
*  Newton's laws of motion? Or was there even a hope of deriving them from the start? And maybe the
*  answer is you don't know, because I certainly don't know. And I've definitely tried to find out.
*  I mean, the sense I have is that the apparent problem there just doesn't bite, unless you've
*  got a kind of broadly in the good sense reductionist picture of what's going on in the world. I mean,
*  if you think that Newton's laws are supposed to be laws for everything, then you can see the
*  contradictions going to turn out pretty fast. If you think Newton's laws is a great for planets and
*  cannonballs, and they're not great for living things, or for clouds, then you're not going to
*  be so bothered. There'll be bits, you'll have a fundamentally pluralist world you're only beginning
*  to understand, and you don't know how all the bits connect together. And the fact that the bit
*  that describes small mechanical stuff has a symmetry in time, and the bit that describes
*  steam engines doesn't have a symmetry time isn't going to bother you. And we can look back now and
*  think how inevitable it ought to be that these things get put together. But you've got to remember
*  even in the early 20th century, people were still taking extremely seriously the idea
*  that living tissue was not described by the same laws of physics that describe nonliving matter,
*  that there were ground level laws of nature that applied to living tissue that didn't apply to
*  nonliving tissue. And it wasn't even a stupid thing to think. I mean, it was always a little
*  unimaginative, but they didn't know about quantum mechanics. So I think the discovery that the world
*  actually is really pretty unified, and that in the good sense, it's pretty reductionist is a
*  really substantive, important discovery of 20th century science. We don't want to just read it
*  back as some automatic a priori fact about science that they could have known just by cognition in
*  the 19th century. So that's my sense of it. It's only when Boltzmann actually writes down something
*  that starts looking like a proper mechanical description of steam or gases or a bit more
*  earlier than that, when Maxwell started to do similar things, it's only once people are
*  starting to actually put in the connective tissue between mechanics and thermodynamics and starting
*  to get results that make it plausible that they're connected in this way, that you start seeing the
*  bite of the tension between that. That's my sense of it. But again, it's historically not superinformed.
*  No, but actually, it makes a lot of sense in it. I like it because, if anything, it elevates the
*  accomplishment of Maxwell and Boltzmann and their friends. I mean, it's not just that they
*  helped establish statistical mechanics, but reductionism, or even the unity of science in
*  some sense, right? The idea that human beings are made of the same stuff and obey the same laws that
*  atoms do is exactly as you say, whoever came up with it, it's a non-trivial step.
*  All of us are trying to get in shape and eat right. Freshly is here to help. Freshly's delicious meals

*  And so then this leads us into what Boltzmann did. So what was the insight into entropy and
*  disorderliness and time that Boltzmann and his friends came up with?
*  Well, again, abstracting a little bit from how that kind of very messy history turned out.
*  The history is not our primary goal here.
*  What they've kind of started to realize was something like, okay, it's not...
*  It can't be that you could just logically derive the asymmetries, the expansion of gases, the second
*  law in your example from these mechanics. You have to put some additional assumption in.
*  And the additional assumptions I put in, or at least one of them, one of the ones that gets a lot
*  of attraction, was some notion of probability. It was some idea that, okay, the gas can't...
*  You can't be sure that the gas will expand to fill the box, but it's extremely likely it's going to.
*  And to some extent, that notion of extremely likely gets cashed out combinatorically. How many ways
*  could the gas be? And almost all the ways the gas could be in this cashing out are ways which
*  is going to expand. That's kind of a bit dodgy because there's infinitely many ways the gas
*  could be, and so comparing the numbers is questionable. But that kind of basic idea
*  was there, that what was going to solve the problem was going to be probability.
*  And the funny thing is that that lesson, actually, I think that idea that you get
*  around this paradox by introducing probability is still, I think, quite often what you run into
*  in the second year undergraduate statistical mechanics course that wants to spend the first
*  lecture doing the history of the subject, so it can spend lectures two through 16 teaching you how
*  to calculate partition functions. But you step back for just a moment, and of course,
*  it can't be true by itself because leaving aside entirely some really deep questions about how we
*  understand probability in this context, the mere introduction of probability doesn't break the
*  time reversibility. If you want to say it's overwhelmingly probable that the gas is going
*  to evolve to fill the box in the future, but you don't want to say it's overwhelmingly probable
*  that the gas is going to have been such that in the past it filled the box, then somewhere you
*  must have broken the time asymmetry. And so the time symmetry and appealing to probability by itself
*  doesn't change that paradox at all. And I think actually I just want to dwell on that statement
*  because it was beautifully put and it's at the heart of a lot of difficulty I think that people
*  have with the arrow of time and with related notions because they come up with some statements,
*  some purported explanations that all sound good, but even though what they're trying to explain
*  is the asymmetry of time, they don't go through the exercise of running that thing backward in
*  time and seeing if it sounds just as good. Absolutely. Now I have an article I did on this
*  a while ago said computer scientists say garbage in, garbage out. If your input is a mess, you're
*  going to get out your output to mess with however clever your program is. So the slogan in statistical
*  mechanics or philosophy of statistical mechanics ought to be reversibility in, reversibility out.
*  If the assumptions you make don't break the symmetry of the problem, they don't distinguish
*  past the future in some sense, it doesn't matter how clever your argument is. If you get out,
*  you will either fail to get out an asymmetry at the end of the argument or you will have cheated
*  somewhere and smuggled in the asymmetry, possibly without even noticing it yourself, but you'll have
*  smuggled it in. Just as a matter of logic, you can't have an input that doesn't distinguish a
*  direction of time and have an output that does distinguish it. So what do we do? What is the
*  right answer? Where does the asymmetry of time come from then? Okay. So well, I think you can
*  think of three strategies and one of them we could probably put aside, which is this idea that it
*  comes from something non-physical, it comes from human intervention or something. So I think for
*  our purposes, we can put that aside and continue with us in our physicalist dogma.
*  Within physics, if you're going to break that symmetry, I think you can only really logically
*  again, you can only do it in two ways. Your dynamics needs to violate the direction of time,
*  these two distinguish past and future, or your boundary conditions need to distinguish past
*  from future. So the former approach needs to change deep physics. Put that aside for the
*  moment. That's another conversation we have and it gets on to something I think we'll talk about
*  later, which is how quantum mechanics plugs into these questions. Assuming you don't want to change
*  the microscopic physics, you've got to say something about an appropriate initial condition.
*  And what often happens is what you end up having to do is say something that gets pushed early and
*  early in time. So let's suppose I do one of these really innocuous sounding statements about it's
*  really probable that the system will approach the gas or spread out later. It was really probable
*  that entropy will increase, et cetera. If I place that condition now, if I say it's a condition on
*  the world now, that we've really high probability entropy is going to happen to the future,
*  or more plausibly, if I have some condition that looks really innocuous and has that consequence.
*  Well, again, it's a matter of time symmetry, it's going to have the same consequence backwards.
*  And the forward result is what we want and the backward result is what we don't want.
*  So you could try to get early, you could say maybe I'll impose a boundary condition 100 years ago
*  that has the consequence that we would expect gases to expand and entropy to go up and so on.
*  Now the last 100 years is fine. And now everything we think is we thought we remembered about
*  everything prior to 1921 is completely wrong. So we could put it back a million years ago,
*  and that saves human history, but it's too bad about the dinosaurs. We can put it back
*  a billion years ago, which is the dinosaurs are fine, but it's too bad about the formation of the
*  solar system. Eventually, you end up saying, again, if we're sticking with this sort of broad picture,
*  we want to be reductionists, we don't want to rely on external intervention. The only real option
*  you've got left is to put some kind of relevant boundary condition at the beginning of time.
*  So then you say, well, the universe or at least the bit of the universe we were aware of the kind
*  of observed cosmos came into being or very early on was such that it has these features, whatever
*  they are, that's another conversation, which established that entropy goes up into the future.
*  And then you've kind of just crossed out the earlier bit. So the paradox doesn't occur.
*  There's a kind of sense to which you haven't exactly broken the time reversal symmetry in
*  physics jargon, the distinction between past and future. You've broken the time translation
*  signature symmetry, the idea that there's no preferred moment in a sense you're using
*  the first moment as your preferred moment. I always get going. Sorry. I've always wondered,
*  again, an unfair historical question. Why didn't Boltzmann or someone in his vicinity
*  propose the Big Bang? Why didn't they take seriously? I mean, he did in a paper,
*  suggests that one way out of these reversibility problems was to have a special initial condition.
*  But it was really like a sentence in a paragraph. And then he moved on with his life, right? And
*  no one quite chased that down and said, Look, you know, stars are burning some kind of fuel,
*  we don't know what it is, but presumably, you can't go on forever. There must have been a moment in
*  the past when things were set up in a special condition. Yeah. So historically, I have no idea.
*  I mean, trying to do a rational reconstruction. I think part of it is until you've got the general
*  theory of relativity, any decision that a particular moment is the first moment is just a labeling
*  choice. If you you could imagine saying, well, this is time equals zero, this is the first moment,
*  it is forbidden to run the dynamics backwards from the first moment. But then your graduate student
*  says, Well, look, it's free country, I'm going to run the dynamics back anyway. And then you've got
*  a perfectly reasonable description backwards. And you've got you've got effectively a symmetric
*  cosmos that has a big bang in both directions, which is an offensive, you know, I gather some
*  quite smart people have played with that idea. But it's not it's not the big bang idea exactly.
*  I think it's when you've got some when you've got some idea of relativity on the table, you've got
*  the idea that the theory might enforce the fact that a moment is first, or as you know, not
*  literally that a moment is first, but that there's a point beyond which you can't find the equations.
*  There was some special moment in the history of the universe.
*  I think that's part of it. But I think also in a way, I don't entirely understand.
*  There was clearly a really strong philosophical prejudice against the big bang. I mean, the
*  advocates of steady state cosmologies did so quite a long time after the empirical case for
*  it was looking shaky. They were clearly very philosophically motivated for it. Beyond the
*  data. As everyone who knows the history of this, they don't know that Einstein could have predicted
*  the big bang and he instead cooked up his equations to stop it happening. So there was clearly some
*  something in the air I don't understand that made people really skeptical about that kind of
*  beginning of time concept. And this is this idea that we need to set up the initial conditions in
*  a certain special way. I mean, number one, it truly blows my mind even to this day that the reason why
*  ice cubes melt and don't unmelt has something to do with what was going on 14 billion years ago at
*  the big bang. So like, I get a lot of mileage out of that. And I'm still impressed with myself.
*  And number two, there's this label for this idea, which is the past hypothesis. And then we
*  argue about what the past hypothesis really means. So what is in your mind is, why do we call it the
*  past hypothesis? And what is it? Okay. So the easy answer to why we call it is because David Albert
*  is good with terminology and came up with this name, I think, or popularized, I'm not sure.
*  It's mostly his language, I think. So that's the shallow. It's some, well, in the middle version,
*  we're just saying something about the initial universe. Some of the reason it gets talked
*  about as a hypothesis is there's a kind of tradition of thinking that somehow,
*  the this assumption about the past is not supposed to be the kind of thing we might make in the same
*  way we know other things about the past. I mean, somehow, it's not just that we like we put up a
*  satellite and the satellite told us something about the early universe. And so we're using that as our
*  boundary condition, it's supposed to be something more that it's a pre, it's a presupposition for
*  the applicability of the physics we've been using, including the physics, the satellite assumes
*  that the very unit of the universe has has this feature. And in terms of what that feature is,
*  I mean, that's contentious. I mean, you and I have been on different sides of some academic
*  conversations about this. I mean, a very popular idea is the condition is something like the very
*  early universe has a very low entropy is in a very special state in the in the probability
*  senses I was using earlier. There's another sense of which I prefer, which is all which is actually
*  something like the it's more that the very early universe is in an appropriate sense, not in a
*  special state. It's in a it's in a state that doesn't have the sort of very delicate, precise
*  correlations between where all the particles are. That would be that you weren't in one of these
*  probable conditions whereby entropy increases. So just how to cash out this condition is pretty
*  subtle matter. I mean, you can you can kind of work out just by logic that there has to be some
*  condition of that kind. If you're not if you're not breaking the symmetry in the dynamics, you've
*  got to break it in the in the boundary conditions. Right. But quite what the right way to break it is.
*  Yeah, it the devil's going to be a little bit of details. Yeah. And I mean, maybe this is actually
*  it's always fun, but also dangerous to get too much into the weeds. But maybe the maybe there's
*  a weeder to that we can get into here because it's worth driving home because even professional
*  physicists struggle with this idea. One way of stating the issue is that, look, we have satellites
*  up there. They've taken pictures of the early universe, right? The cosmic microwave background,
*  it's very smooth, almost homogeneous, but with tiny little ripples in it. And we explain that
*  in terms of the smooth Big Bang 14 billion years ago. And let's take for granted right now the idea
*  that that condition of a hot, dense, smooth early universe is low entropy. We can talk about that,
*  too. Let's say that is low entropy. So there's an attitude that would say, look, we've taken a
*  picture of it. It's not a hypothesis. We have data that says it was low entropy. But then the
*  much more subtle counter argument is, in the space of all possible ways that microwave photons could
*  have come to our telescope and looked smooth, it turns out that most of them do not correspond
*  to an early universe that actually is smooth, right? There are many, many more ways the early
*  universe could have been wildly fluctuating, but with very, very subtle coincidences and conspiracies
*  that made the radiation get to us and look smooth. And it's that kind of perverse behavior that you
*  in the past hypothesis are trying to rule out. Is that fair? Right. I think that's fair. Although
*  let me give a caveat because you were helping yourself a moment ago to this kind of, well,
*  there's vastly more ways it could be this than it could be that. And I was using that kind of way
*  talking earlier. But actually, I think if you push on this, it starts getting into trouble.
*  I mean, I said sort of flippantly, well, there are infinitely many ways the system could be,
*  so there's no sense in which could be more one way than another. But that is kind of true in a way.
*  And even if there were like a million, billion, gazillion, gazillion ways the system could be
*  with its finite, it doesn't follow from the fact that there are millions, zillion, billion,
*  gazillion, gazillion ways the system could be that it is equally likely to be each of those ways.
*  I mean, I think we've got a ton of evidence from the actual application of physics,
*  that there's some robust notion of probability in statistical mechanics.
*  But I also think we've got quite a lot of reason to think that that notion of probability is not
*  something we can get at a priori from just counting possibilities. There's something
*  substantive additional going on. The assumption is roughly something like,
*  for a given macroscopic way the world could be, then it's again, leaving aside my caveat about
*  infinity, each of the microscopic ways it could be conditional with that macroscopic way it could be
*  is equally likely. That's something like the way of stating it. But it's quite a big step.
*  That's something I think there's empirical evidence for, at least with some qualifiers and caveats
*  and worries about the direction of time. But at some level, there's empirical evidence for it.
*  When we make that assumption, and we derive equations as a result of that assumption,
*  and we check the experiments in the lab or in the sky, the equations get the answer right.
*  That probability assumption is evidenced. We don't need to think that it is our priority.
*  The view that somehow if there's lots of different macroscopic ways the system could be,
*  then it's more likely to be in the macroscopic state that has more microscopic states
*  corresponding to it. Well, there are special circumstances in which that's evidenced as well.
*  When systems have reached equilibrium, when they've had lots of time to interact and move
*  around the space, then there's evidence that's true. But as a kind of a priori statement about
*  the world, I don't think it's something we've got evidence for or a good logical reason that
*  it has to be true. So while in a certain sense, you're clearly right that there are many more
*  ways it's much more probable that the universe fluctuated into the way it is now rather than
*  the satellites gave us the right answer. There's another sense in which that's non-innocent,
*  that there are some assumptions about how to think about probability that are doing some work in that
*  argument. Longtime Mindscape listeners know that our two cats, Ariel and Caliban, are the real
*  bosses here at Mindscape International Headquarters. So we need to keep them happy, and Sweet Scoop is
*  the kitty litter that makes that possible. The thing about Sweet Scoop is not only that it works
*  as a kitty litter, the cats love it, the odor is good, the absorption is good, but it's also
*  environmentally friendly because Sweet Scoop comes from wheat rather than from clay. Wheat, it turns
*  out, has naturally occurring starches and enzymes that actively break things down. It's low dust,
*  low tracking, and easy to dispose of. And unlike clay-based litter, Sweet Scoop is 100% biodegradable.
*  For over 25 years, Sweet Scoop has provided a litter that works great without compromising
*  on what matters. 100% natural ingredients and 99.5% dust-free. So if you're stuck between litter that

*  bit persnickety, but that is your professional job, right? I mean, you're a philosopher, so that's
*  okay. Pretty much a job description. Yeah, exactly. We're not going to hold that against you. But so,
*  let me just rephrase it very quickly just so we keep separate what the contentious parts are and
*  what the parts everyone agrees with are. I mean, you're probably right that since my job description
*  is physicist and not philosopher, I speak sloppily. That's my job description, right? So I use the
*  word probability where I really meant number of different states or something like that.
*  I do think that philosophers can sometimes be too persnickety about counting the number of different
*  states. I think there's a perfectly obvious way to count the number of different states.
*  And that doesn't mean that it's a probability distribution. That doesn't mean that in Penrose's
*  famous formulation that God threw a dartboard randomly at that space of states. But there remains
*  the fact that the past hypothesis needs to have some way of saying that in the space of all the
*  different ways the universe could have been, there's a measure, there's a way of counting,
*  and our real universe was in a very, very tiny region in that space. And that's the past hypothesis
*  broadly construed. Yeah. Okay. So I don't think this is just pen and paper. I think we actually
*  disagree on something substantive here. I mean, so there's a well-known way of stating the past
*  hypothesis that says something like you said there, that the hypothesis is that the early
*  universe was in a very low entropy state or a certain particular state that is in fact very
*  low entropy. And that if one assumes that, then one gets the direction of time right. I actually
*  think that's the wrong way to state the hypothesis. And one way of getting at that is I think this is
*  like a minor bit of it. I mean, however low entropy the initial universe was in, it could have ended
*  up in an even lower entropy state later. The issues about time reversibility are still there.
*  I mean, let's suppose that the early, well, okay. So firstly, actually, let's say the early
*  universe was very hot and very dense. And we've established that we think that's a low entropy
*  state. It's still a sense in which it could have been hotter and denser and it would have been
*  lower. It could have been hotter and it would be lower entropy. So there's a certain worry there.
*  But more seriously, suppose that was a very low entropy state. There's still a way in which it
*  could have fluctuated to an even lower entropy state. So we don't rule out that possibility
*  just by specifying this very low entropy initial state. We have to say something else.
*  And the something else I think takes the form, actually helped myself to the physicist sloppiness,
*  that given that initial state, it was equally likely to be in any of the microscopic states
*  corresponding to it. And so it was super unlikely to be in one of the fluctuating to an even lower
*  entropy state. But my feeling is once you said that, once you said, okay, given the macro state
*  of the early universe, it was equally likely to be in any of the micro states combattant with it.
*  I don't think anything more is gained, at least for the purpose of explaining the hour of time
*  in the here and now by saying, and what's more, that state was a really low entropy state.
*  I mean, if it was a really high entropy state, the world would not look like this.
*  The world would probably not look like that.
*  But it's also true that if it was in a state with a different kind of
*  matter-antimatter ratio, it also not look like this. The smoothness of the early universe explains
*  lots of things about the here and now. But I'm not compelled by the argument that it explains the
*  time directedness of our macroscopic physics. So let me see. So in other words, you're saying,
*  so actually, let's back up a little bit. There's the idea of a macro state, which we sort of
*  glossed over and people want to make a big deal about this. And I think it's proper to make a
*  big deal about this. So one of Boltzmann's genius moves was to say, look, you know, there's atoms,
*  molecules, they're moving around, but I can't see what the atoms molecules are. So I'm going to
*  group them, all the atoms, molecules that look similar into a single group that I'll call a
*  macro state. I don't know if he used those words, but that's what we do. And so people have been
*  asking, so I will ask you, like, what's the license to do that? Is that okay? Is that objective? Or
*  is your human agency sneaking its way in here? Something subjective? Good. Yeah, I mean, the
*  words get used in two kind of different ways. And I think one of them should worry reductionist,
*  naturalist, so one of them basically shouldn't. And the one that should worry people is the one
*  that defines macroscopic in terms of our own abilities to distinguish them. So you want to
*  say, well, the reason why why we treat two different configurations of gas in the room
*  as being the same macro state is something like, we can't distinguish between them with our eyes,
*  or sometimes even like, we're only interested in the gas at the level of a coarse graining,
*  as you like, like a macroscopic description. But you know, I mean, hashtag embarrassing confessions,
*  I don't actually care about the gas at all. With the odd the minimal requirements to be able to
*  breathe, I don't really mind where the air in my room is, it's still true that the term thermodynamics
*  describes it fairly well, even though I'm not curious about it. And similarly, we use statistical
*  mechanics to describe even things like the way galaxies and stars in the galaxy develop. And
*  we can obviously just, you know, our telescopes can tell us where the damn stars are. And yet we
*  still want to dump various clearly visibly distinct ranges of stars into the same
*  macro state and say what we care about is the average distribution of the stars or something.
*  So I think the good notion of macro state, the one that the naturalist can be relaxed about is
*  something like, this is a level of description, at which you can get some kind of robust,
*  autonomous in the philosophers jargon sense self contained, dynamical story. So it's a,
*  if I, if I want to know how the air in the room is going to evolve over the next five minutes,
*  at a certain coarse grain description, it turns out that all I need to know about the air now
*  is again, at a certain core, well, bodge low these worries about thermodynamics,
*  so it just empirically, it's true that I can make reliable predictions about what the air will do
*  at a certain course level, provided I know what the air is doing now at a certain course level.
*  And then we, we have equations that say what water does that don't require us to say where
*  all the individual molecules are, we can we can do, we can do high level science, and the macro
*  states are the way of breaking up the lower level stuff into high level stuff such that you can do
*  high level science. But that's the robust version, I think that we, we shouldn't be suspicious about.
*  Yeah, and I think, go ahead, sorry. I was just gonna say, I mean, that feeds into not just
*  statistical mechanics, but bigger issues of emergence. And Dan Dennett, former mindscape
*  guest has this wonderful phrase, real patterns that you also that you make use of in the in the
*  case of the Everett interpretation. I mean, the fact that you don't need to know absolutely
*  everything about the universe, but you can have incomplete information and still in the right
*  circumstances make predictions about it is an objective fact about the universe. And that's
*  what we appeal to in this sort of Boltzmannian core screening. Yeah, absolutely. And it's a
*  solid effect of reductionism itself. I mean, it's just empirically true that we can write down
*  reliable equations for what gases do. Didn't have to be that way. Now, if you can, often we found
*  those equations, because we did microphysics and worked it up, but not always. And even if we've
*  done the microphysics work it out, we could have thrown it away, and still check the equations,
*  they were still right. Right. So it's so far as your best theory of microphysics
*  says it's not possible to have equations of that form so much the worst for your best theory of
*  microphysics. We are actual evidence for our microscopic physics mostly doesn't come from
*  microscopic measurements. Mostly it comes from these millions of intermediate calculations.
*  We talked about the standard model explaining everything or underpinning everything. There's
*  almost no experiment that counts as a systematic test of the standard model as a whole. As you
*  well know, there are approximations and chains of approximations that ground all the various ways
*  these theories work. And the first order evidence is the evidence that these various approximations
*  are right. And because they're right, then that gives some support for the theory for which we
*  derive them. But really the world we find empirically in the first order is a world just
*  full of all of these different processes, different levels that we think are connected.
*  And we've got I think we've got good reason to think connected, but which we have evidence for
*  even if they're not connected. Good. And specifically, so there is some sort of objectiveness
*  to the coarse graining that we choose in practice. And specifically, because some of my favorite
*  super smart cosmologists don't understand this, the early universe has a low entropy in those
*  in that coarse graining. There's this feeling that you say something like, look, it's just a black
*  body radiation. That's high entropy. You know, how could it it it had the highest entropy it
*  could have had given that it was tiny. But when you turn on gravity, that's not true. So am I right
*  to say that the it's fair to say the early universe had low entropy compared to what it could have had
*  and gravity has something to do with it. Yeah, but really, here's something I don't understand
*  about this. Yeah. In these conversations, cosmologists, I mean, absolutely, the early
*  universe had low entropy compared to what it could have. But one really quick way to tell that is,
*  I mean, the early universe had low entropy compared to the current universe. I mean, if it
*  if it didn't, the second law of thermodynamics is empirically wrong. And no one thinks that. Well,
*  yes, it really better be the case that the early universe was was lower entry in the present
*  universe. We shouldn't need to give some subtle transcendental argument as to why it must have
*  must be lower. It had better be lower in order not to blow our entire thermodynamic theory out
*  of the water. But to be fair, the argument which is completely wrong, but still the it's not it's
*  not completely nonsensical is that there's sort of an envelope of maximum possible entropy. Yeah,
*  just because the universe was smaller and sort of it was the argument is that it was as high entropy
*  as it could have been, even though slower entropy than now. But even that argument is totally wrong
*  because it ignores gravity and black holes and things like that. Yeah, although I mean, it does,
*  but I'd also say that it actually ignores the fact the universe is expanding. And I think even
*  that homogeneous piece of it in some ways, like smooth is enough to do the work we need of it
*  here. I mean, the the very early universe was in this equilibrium thermal state, then it expanded.
*  And then that was the was the hot that was the highest entropy it could be given the other
*  constraints on it. And given that it was uniform, given as uniform is a huge constraint.
*  Absolutely. But look, go forward a little while, and it's still uniform, but it's no longer the
*  highest entropy it could be. And there comes a point where all the quiet glue on slush has turned
*  into neutrons and protons. And there comes a further point when some of the neutrons and protons
*  are fused into helium. So there comes a point when it's about three quarters hydrogen and one
*  quarter helium. And then it stops there. And it carries on being three quarters hydrogen and one
*  quarter helium. If it had if it had wanted to stay at equilibrium, it wouldn't have done that.
*  Right. The the equilibrium condition for the universe. This is more your territory than mine,
*  but like, well, well before it gets gets non homogenous on large scales, it was it was the
*  the equilibrium configuration would have been all helium. That's right. And it wasn't all helium.
*  And why? Well, it was expanding so fast that the particles got too far apart before they finished
*  crashing into each other enough to make helium. So I just use that as a illustration. The
*  you're absolutely right, of course, about the fact that gravity and things not being uniform mean
*  that the real story about entropy in in gravitating systems is just radically different from non
*  gravitating systems. But even at a more basic level than that, trying to apply kind of equilibrium
*  arguments to a system that is very rapidly expanding is itself really dubious, really
*  rapidly expanding systems are not at equilibrium. And the universe's macro conditions are changing
*  very fast. So it was only ever reasonable to suppose it was some kind of local equilibrium.
*  There's there's a you can think about the universe while it's still uniform as being sort of like a
*  piston. If I put some very hot gas in a piston, and I expanded it very gently, then the gas would
*  always stay instantaneous equilibrium. And if your piston was like ridiculously strong,
*  you could compress it, you could expand it from being a quark glue on plasma all the way to being
*  cold iron. And it would all be equilibrium. If you pull the piston apart a bit faster than that,
*  then it'll freeze out at some mixture of stuff that hasn't finished going to equilibrium. And
*  it did that because it was expanding and it was expanding too quickly. And so I think those things
*  are going on in the only universe. Even before you start considering gravity and effects of
*  gravity and non uniform distributions. And when you think that the the earth is powered by fusion
*  from the sun and the fusion for the sun is possible because there was lots of hydrogen left over from
*  the Big Bang, which wouldn't have been left over if the universe had stayed at equilibrium,
*  as long as it was uniform, then you realize that the thermodynamics of the present day
*  actually rests on some of these factors as much as it rests on
*  issues that non uniform systems are higher entry. So I, I, I'm tempted to go back into the weeds on
*  the past hypothesis definition, but I said I worry that we're getting too much into the weeds on that
*  there's a lot of non weeds things that I want to get to. I think there's another unfair thing I'm
*  doing here, which is this is actually a place where we have a some minor but quite interesting
*  intellectual differences. I'm pushing my side against your position as a podcast host who
*  can't kind of fire back with the full force. You totally are. And I might, I'm not even sure whether
*  I disagree with you or not. So we should have an offline discussion and then we'll, we'll put it
*  somewhere on the internet to reward. We'll make it as a reward for the Patreon subscribers or
*  something like that. But, but okay, but you said something that I think is very important to this
*  bigger picture discussion. As the universe expands, there's this competition between
*  things trying to equilibrate photons and electrons and protons and neutrons and helium
*  versus the fact the universe is expanding. And so it doesn't stay in equilibrium because otherwise,
*  like you said, the hydrogen would just keep fusing the helium would keep fusing, you would
*  all create all the, the elements up to iron and then you would stop there. So the, the sort of
*  hidden fact that is relevant there is that even though the second law says entropy increases,
*  there's no law that says entropy increases as fast as possible. Right? I mean, sometimes people
*  try to invoke laws like that in living systems or dissipative systems or something like that. I mean,
*  how just very, very big picture. How far do you think we can go beyond the second law to be
*  quantitative about the ways in which entropy increases? Yeah. So I'm not sure I'm not even
*  sure entropy is always the reliable language to use here. I mean, we have so one of the things I
*  tend to do as a, as a philosopher of physics is try sometimes to step down a little bit from the
*  big picture of how this could possibly work and say, well, what are the ways in which it's actually
*  been work being done? And what are the assumptions that are going into them? So we've got a very
*  developed theory of, of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in the jargon of the, of the physics of
*  systems that aren't equilibrium and are genuinely changing at time, but are big enough that you need
*  to use these kinds of averaging methods of statistical mechanics of thermodynamics to study them.
*  And what you find in those stories is that entropy mostly seems to be a bookkeeping device. You can
*  tell reliable stories about irreversibility. And normally those are processes in which the
*  entropy of the system is going up. And when they're not, it's only because there's some environment
*  that's absorbing the entropy cost, but the actual, the dynamic, it's not like, well, in the language
*  I was using earlier about robust autonomous structures, we don't there seem to have a robust
*  autonomous dynamics of entropy. Right. And you need to know more about the system than just its
*  entropy to know what it's going to do. And different systems do radically different things. And
*  there doesn't seem to be any general law that systems want to really get directly into the tool.
*  I mean, here's a sort of an example that is at an abstract level has just the same structure as the
*  hydrogen helium example, but it's perhaps easier for people to grasp. If I take a box and I fill it
*  with a mixture of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas, I got a glass jargon, and I leave that on my shelf,
*  it can sit there for years and be perfectly happy sitting there. And if you think equilibrium is the
*  state that things make their way to fairly quickly and then stay there, you might be forgiven for
*  thinking that that box of a mixture of hydrogen oxygen is at equilibrium. But if you strike a match,
*  you'll find out really quickly realize it was not at equilibrium. And that it's much more
*  entropically favorable, much more thermodynamically favorable for the hydrogen oxygen to react and
*  form water and blow your lab up. But there just happens to be a dynamical bar to us getting and
*  it's not. It's not a mysterious bar. It's about the fact that the tip the typical energies of
*  there's a certain amount of energy of which hydrogen oxygen need to crash together in order
*  to turn to water. And that typical energy is much higher than the typical energy of actual
*  hydrogen oxygen in the gas. And so typically, they just bounce off each other and keep going
*  if you waited really, really long times, it would happen. But it's just not going to happen
*  spontaneously in the time scale when you're sitting in the room. And so we understand at some level,
*  we understand the physics of that fine. But the point is, it's that specifics of the physics that
*  tells us that this system does not have increasing entry. So they can't I take from examples of that
*  kind that there can't be there can't be uniform or universal principles about how quickly entropy
*  increases or something. That doesn't that's not to say that there might not be powerful
*  generalizations that are not universal, but nonetheless, have a universality in physics
*  jargon apply to a very large class of systems. As far as I can see, we don't very systematically
*  have things of that kind so far. But that doesn't tell us anything about whether we could have
*  things of that kind. So I don't know. I mean, this is more that that kind of what what are the most
*  promising routes to develop an exciting new piece of physics is a place where I have to submit a
*  subject center now outside my comfort zone. So I'm not sure. There are some things you just can't
*  do from the comfort of home, you can't go on a hike, you can't go see a concert. But what you
*  can do is exercise and with Peloton, you'll have a workout experience like no other without
*  ever leaving home. One of the great things about Peloton is the feeling that you're in a community
*  that there are other people participating struggling and sweating along with you.
*  So even though you have the convenience of being at your own home, you get the common feeling that
*  everyone is in this together. From keeping up with close friends to enjoying world class workouts

*  goes up. But that doesn't mean that entropy is necessarily the best thing to be keeping track of
*  when you're trying to formulate these rules. And in fact, I would spin it in a positive way is saying,
*  as a researcher, like, there's a lot of landscape out there for potential discoveries of better ways
*  to state these universal rules that we don't have non equilibrium changes and statistical mechanics
*  is a rapidly growing field right now and sort of has been sadly neglected in the previous century.
*  So I'm optimistic about that. Well, good. So this is a good sort of segue then into these remaking
*  the connections we started with to other arrows of time. So we have a complicated universe full
*  of all sorts of different things with manifest manifestations, I should say, of time asymmetry,
*  which we're going to say are ultimately due to the let's say, let's call the thermodynamic
*  arrow of time, you know, the fact that entropy is increasing, however you want to characterize
*  that arrow of time. So why does the fact that ice cubes melt and don't unmelt help me understand why
*  I remember the past but not the future or why I get older as time goes on? Yeah.
*  I'm not sure I know the right general thing to say here. And I think a lot of the attempts to say it
*  have never been, I never found completely compelling. I mean, look, here's a starting
*  point that I think matters. When we talk about the way in which the physics distinguishes the
*  past from the future, sometimes we characterize that as just there isn't a symmetry that reflects
*  past and future but that I think doesn't fully get at it. I mean, there are, as you know, there
*  are there are microscopic bits of physics that in a certain sense, genuinely break the symmetry of
*  past and future the decay of neutrons in a certain way. Or that's a certain, rather more
*  esoteric than that, I guess, actually for that symmetry. Esoteric bits of particle physics
*  actually seem to break the past future symmetry, but not in a way that matters from this point of
*  view, not in my, if you ran the video backwards, would it be manifestly obvious that you were doing
*  it? What I think matters in the way these dynamics run differently forward and backwards is that
*  they have irreversibility and they have noise. Irreversibility meaning
*  you lose information, lots of different initial states come together and end up in the same final
*  state. Noise in the sense that it becomes at least de facto impossible to predict which of many
*  future states the system is going to make its way into. And those features of irreversibility and
*  noise wash out information in the evolution process. So you sort of see this if you look
*  at predicting forward and backwards. If I've got something like the solar system physics,
*  like I was saying for eclipses, the way I go about predicting what the solar system will be like in
*  a thousand years time is exactly the same as the way in which we predict the world, retro-dict,
*  to use the jargon, the way the world will be was a thousand years ago. And we say this funny
*  neologism retro-dict in this situation because we really are just doing a prediction just with
*  time set as negative. Mostly you can't retro-dict macroscopic laws. If I've got the ice cubes in
*  isolation, or I've got my cup with a little bit of ice and there's cold water around it,
*  I can predict pretty reliably the rate at which that ice cube will melt and the length of time
*  at which the ice cube has gone entirely. I can't retro-dict that way. I can't work out
*  which ice cubes were there before, how they were put in. That information is just lost.
*  Maybe the micro-physics still knows it, but at the level of description we're talking about,
*  it's just gone. So I think at some level, these kind of ways in which our dynamics are irreversible,
*  information losing, are also in the business of distributing stuff across space in a way and not
*  bringing them back in. These are the kind of features of dynamics that then suggest that if
*  you try to build things in that dynamics, if you try to do information processing in that dynamics,
*  that information processing is also going to have to have a clear distinction in the way it treats
*  the past and treats the future. So that's the proof of concept. I don't think I've ever worked
*  out fully to my satisfaction how the details of that are going to go. Why does that general
*  asymmetry of information processing specifically lead to the fact that we're putting down records
*  about the past and making partially reliable predictions about the future and not vice versa?
*  I think the quick attempts to do it are not convincing. The convincing attempts aren't
*  fully there. There seems to be at least a naive tension between what you said,
*  which is certainly true, about the fact that there's dissipation and we lose information
*  in some real sense with the fact that as a real person, I think that I'm learning things as time
*  goes on and I am writing books and there's information in the books. So there's some
*  local increase in the amount that I know about the past and that's clearly going to be a little bit
*  tricky to reconcile. Yeah. And look, I guess you know, of course, by the same token, there's an
*  apparent tension, it's long been recognized. Some people who shouldn't know better have used it to
*  argue against science or for all sorts of excuses. It's long been the case that there's an apparent
*  tension between the fact that entropy always seems to go up and the fact that we get towards
*  equilibrium and the fact that I personally am not at equilibrium and don't expect to be at equilibrium
*  for some decades. And of course, the answer to that is, I'm mysterious. I'm not a closed system.
*  I can maintain my own low entropy by dumping entropy into the world around me, just like my
*  fridge can stay cold by warming up the room. And at some level, these kind of information processing
*  things have the same answer, I think you can, even if the physical processes that are going on are
*  systematically, in some sense, losing information, then I could provide it, provided I don't mind
*  dumping the world into randomized states, I can still maintain an increase in information about
*  the things that interest me. Which brings up a related worry that people often try to pinpoint
*  me with, you know, if you think that all of the differences between past and future ultimately
*  come from this thermodynamic gradient, if someone puts you in a refrigerator and your entropy starts
*  going down, do you suddenly remember the future but not the past? I mean, is it possible to sort
*  of completely reverse the arrow of time locally in a way that would make physics seem very weird?
*  Yeah, well, not by putting you in the refrigerator. I mean, well, it kind of goes a bit to what we
*  were saying earlier about entropy not necessarily being the sole measure of irreversibility. I mean,
*  there are a ton of irreversible processes in your body. And even if you're cooling down,
*  so that your overall entropy is decreasing, those processes are still happening irreversibly.
*  The dynamics that's governing all of the kind of biology in your cells is still happening
*  in a way that draws a clear past future distinction. Now, if you did something to
*  you that systematically reversed those directions, that's another matter. But now you won't do that
*  by the fridge. Now we need kind of space aliens and godlike science to do it. And we kind of know
*  what would happen if you were run backwards, you'd, and if your environment was preserved. So if you're
*  if I was preserved to be compatible with it, then obviously it would just be like, you know, what,
*  leaving aside I think a slightly badly phrased quest about what that would be like subjectively,
*  then from the point of view of the of the person watching, you would just do everything backwards.
*  Right. But that's that, I mean, obviously, we set the problem up that way. That's trivial.
*  If your environment was not also running backwards, I think you probably think extremely
*  quickly the environment would mess up would mess with the way you were trying to run backwards and
*  start you running forwards again. Yeah. So this crude kind of thing, like just lowering your
*  entropy overall is not nearly enough to truly reverse your personal arrow time. Exactly all the
*  very if what we're really after here is dynamically reversibility, then the dynamically reversible
*  processes are not are not changed by is a very, what's going on in entropy terms, all of those
*  processes are still generating their entropy. And we're also swacking a big chunk of entropy
*  out of your system just by just by moving bits of your body that are locally at equilibrium
*  to bits of your body that are local equilibrium at a lower temperature. And that overall entry
*  budget, which is a sum of the various non equilibrium bits of your body doing non equilibrium
*  stuff and increases entropy, plus the the non the the the the orderly cooling down bits of you,
*  all of that's going to be positive going to be negative so the entropy drops, but
*  it's still the case that dynamics in your body is cleanly distinguished between past and future.
*  It's just that that crude indicator of which way is the entropy gradient going isn't doing it for
*  you. There's more to thermodynamic irreversibility than just the entropy gradient. Well, you know, I
*  believe everything you just said, but I think you're missing a big opportunity for a startup that
*  would not only preserve you in time, but actually make you younger just by putting you in a
*  refrigerator. Like if you could develop some theory of that, you could be making beaucoup
*  bucks. I'm just saying. If it worked, I think I can make a lot of money. If I could convince
*  people it would work, I could be making almost as much money. A little bit too honest.
*  Yeah, the convincing people works is an easier task than making it work. So I think that's the
*  whole secret to being in this in this business. But okay, all right, with good with all that
*  wonderful stuff on the table. There is a looming specter over this whole discussion, which is that
*  we've been speaking pretty classically, right? Good old we even mentioned Isaac Newton and Maxwell
*  and people like that. And there's a famous part of physics where it does not seem manifestly
*  time symmetric, which is the act of observation and the collapse of the wave function in quantum
*  mechanics. So you know something about quantum mechanics. How do you think about I mean, either
*  generally or you're very happy to dive right into Everett and many worlds if you want. But
*  how do you think about the time asymmetry of measurement in quantum theory? Good. Okay, so
*  my starting point is going to be that same kind of dynamics first, broadly reductionist starting
*  point that I think we just sort of took as a common starting point an hour ago. And that's
*  going to be so measurement here is just a special case of large scale interaction measurements happen
*  when some relatively small scale thing gets magnified up in a highly redundant way.
*  So the processes of measurement from that point of view are going to have to be special cases of
*  this process of being magnified to the to the macroscopic. But of course, famously in quantum
*  mechanics, that process is problematic. The the process of measurement of max copy amplification
*  de facto looks something like the randomized collapse of the wave function.
*  As a practical matter, it looks as if what was originally a superposition of lots of possible
*  goings on snaps into being one of them. And what what's really going on to justify that is another
*  matter. But that's kind of how it how it just looks from the point of view of doing the practical
*  physics. The emergent level description is a description where I move from a superposition
*  to a randomly selected element of the superposition. But that process is blatantly
*  manifestly time irreversible. And it's always amazed me, it's less true than it used to be,
*  but for long terms always amazed me that that kind of quantum mechanical hour of time was the sort of
*  I know the forgotten stepchild of the arrows of time in physics, it got very little air time
*  compared to the other the sexier hours of time, as you like that. But really, it's because we say
*  quantum mechanics is kind of fundamental, it really ought to kind of matter here that it's turning up.
*  And I think the reason why it doesn't well, there's a there's a state there's a claimed reason why
*  people don't worry about these quantum effects. And there's a real reason I think that the the
*  claimed reason is something like there'll be a standard line you'll get at the beginning of
*  almost any sort of textbook of philosophy of statistical mechanics, it'll say something like,
*  yes, I'm using classical mechanics. Yes, the world's really quantum. Yes, we better allow
*  for the quantum effects. But quantum mechanics is technically the quantum statistical mechanics is
*  technically more complicated than classical statistical mechanics. And the same foundation
*  essentially the same foundational issues arise. I've said those words. That is, I think, just
*  almost exactly wrong as a statement of what's going on. I think, I think actually, for foundational
*  purposes, I mean, I won't get to the details because it's written to the weeds for foundational
*  processes, quantum mechanics is easier. There's a bunch of there's a bunch of pathological features
*  of classical mechanics that are not present in quantum mechanics that I mean, if you want to
*  calculate that you're having to help you, but if you want to just work out the abstract structure
*  of the problem, it is easier to be quantum. And the and the and the issues change profoundly.
*  For a bunch of reasons, and I'm sure we'll come on to more of them. But but
*  in the first instance, just precisely because of this clear asymmetry of the of measurement of
*  macroscopic amplification, I think the real reason people who write textbooks on this stuff or
*  monographs on this stuff do classical statistical mechanics is they're scared of the quantum
*  measurement problem. And they don't want their beautiful thesis about statistical mechanics to
*  be adulterated by all of this quantum mechanical stuff. I mean, I would agree with that if we
*  interpreted the word scared as having a concern that it would derail the entire discussion.
*  That's fair. Yeah. And I think the problem is it does derail the entire discussion. But that's
*  another way of saying that quantum mechanics is really important to understand the statistical
*  mechanical hour of time. But I suppose put it this way, look at that, that asymmetry we're talking
*  about. And that asymmetry cannot cleanly distinguish from the statistical mechanical asymmetry.
*  It's not exactly the same as it, but it's intimately related to it. And if you I mean,
*  there's a bunch of different ways of seeing it. But if you think that, for instance, almost every
*  if you think the clap the the collapse of the wave function is a genuinely random process
*  at a really deep level, for instance, it more or less, it always destroys any concerns that
*  I can run my probability argument just as well forward and backwards. If it's extremely probable
*  that the current state will evolve into a higher entropy state, but there are certain super special
*  ways that the current state could be that could have evolved into a low entropy state. Well,
*  even if even if you put the system on these super special states, it's not going to stay there for
*  long because quantum randomness will just kick it around a bit. So if you had fundamental collapse
*  of the wave function, you would break the asymmetry in time of the dynamics in a way that it's
*  puristically really plausible, would sort out statistical mechanics. If I thought collapse of
*  the wave function was a good idea, then I could go on a sub leg for how we can reform statistics.
*  I think for reasons that I think you share, but this is a terrible idea. It's a good idea. It's
*  a fundamentally wrong thing. It doesn't work. It's not the right way to go. The right way to go,
*  I think, is something like the many worlds interpretation. We want to say that quantum
*  mechanics really maintains all those super positions. And the fact that it looks as if we've got
*  one of the possible outcomes at all at once rather than all of them at the same time
*  is perfect. We just happen to be the kind of physical system that's sitting in one of those
*  terms. There's a David in one of the other branches after a quantum measurement who's just
*  as committed to being David as I'm committed. And of course, there's a whole panoply of issues
*  associated to many worlds quantum mechanics anyway, but to stick with the statistical
*  mechanical issues, many worlds quantum mechanics is time-inverse and variant because it's just
*  unitary training equation quantum mechanics. It's reversible in the previous senses.
*  And so there isn't any prospect in many worlds quantum mechanics of having some prior quantum
*  error of time that underpins the statistical mechanical error of time. In a sense, it's
*  almost the other way around. If you look at the kind of mathematics that's used to describe
*  the measurement and the amplification of superposition to the macroscopic, and the
*  thing that quantum physicists call decoherence where it becomes impossible in practice to detect
*  the many worlds nature of systems because they get so tangled up with their environment.
*  If you look at the actual mathematics of all of that, it's all statistical mechanical. The
*  kind of assumptions made to derive those equations are just the same assumptions as we use to derive
*  the equations in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. In fact, sometimes they're literally
*  the same equations. There is a thing that people in decoherence theory, in fact,
*  they use the quantum mechanics use the decoherence master equation, standard models of how
*  the environment affects the model system. This is literally the same as a standard equation that's
*  used in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and has been used from the 60s and 70s. There's
*  nothing unto all that. No one's denying that, but it's surprisingly often not recognized because
*  the people working on one side of that divide aren't super familiar with the other side.
*  I met that equation as a grad student interested in quantum mechanics in the 90s in the Decahiers
*  literature. It was 20 years before I rediscovered this in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
*  I'm a philosopher and I get to do all the stuff.
*  I think we can take on board the idea that our listeners
*  know that there's something called quantum mechanics and there's a wave function as a super
*  position of different things. Even that they know that you and I are both fans of the many
*  worlds interpretation, which says that like you say, collapses aren't real. There's just this
*  smooth reversible evolution of the wave function. Okay, but then there's branching. I think that's
*  exactly where the time asymmetry comes in. Maybe before the time asymmetry, we should ask,
*  because this is a crucial question and I try my best to give good answers to it, but it doesn't
*  always satisfy people. What do you mean by branching? When does that happen? How often does it happen?
*  How should I think about that? Good. Okay, so to back up a little bit, here's what I think about.
*  If people listen carefully, I'm going to smuggle in a whole bunch of assumptions about the direction
*  of time that we'll need to come back to, but ignoring that for the moment.
*  What's going on when we measure a system or we allow a microscopic system to magnify up to the
*  macroscopic is effectively that lots and lots and lots of other bits of the world get tangled up,
*  get quantum entangled with the system question. So the full experiment I always start with,
*  I've got something like Schrodinger's cat and Schrodinger's cat is alive and dead at the same
*  time. The normal form of the quantum measurement problem says that can't be the way things are,
*  because when I look at cats, I never see them alive and dead at the same time.
*  And somewhere in the background there is the idea that what it would be like to see a cat alive and
*  dead at the same time is kind of like what it was like in the before days before the pandemic,
*  where you just got really drunk with friends and you're so drunk you saw double. So seeing a cat
*  alive and dead at the same time would be like having an experience of seeing a really weird,
*  indefinite cat. That's intuitively what it would be like to see a cat that's alive and dead at the
*  same time. Intuition is a really bad way to work out how things look in the physical theory.
*  If you ask the physics what it would look like, well, if I look at a cat that's alive,
*  that's just a physical process. So my brain goes into some state, or my body goes to some state
*  you might describe as a seeing a live cat state. And if I see a dead cat, then I go into a state
*  that you might describe as a seeing a dead cat state. So the Schoening equation is linear. So
*  what that means is if I, never mind the details of that, it means if I look at a cat that's alive
*  and dead at the same time, then my state after that is seeing a live cat and seeing a dead cat
*  at the same time. I'm not myself in some definite state of seeing a weird, indefinite cat. I'm myself
*  in an indefinite state between two rather mundane cat-seeing experiences. And the cat's connected
*  up. So the me and the cat together are jointly in a state of cat alive, I see live cat, plus cat dead,
*  I see dead cat. And if I then tell you on the podcast whether the cat's alive or not, then you
*  end up in a being told it's alive and being told it's dead state at the same time. And your listeners
*  when it's played, I mean, much sooner than this really, but in fantasy for the moment, your
*  listeners when it's played are in a being told by Sean the cat's alive plus being told by Sean
*  the cat's dead state at the same time. And again, it's all correlated to the whole quantum state of
*  me and you and the cat and your listeners is a sum of two things, both of which are ordinary. One of
*  them is the cat's alive, I told you the cat's alive and you broadcast on the internet. And the other
*  one is the cat's dead, I told you the cat's dead and you broadcast that on the internet. And the
*  rest of the world, as they hear about and find out we get entangled, the reality actually is
*  it's faster and less picturesque than that. The ordinary kind of electromagnetic disruptions
*  and things for me doing this will spread out at the speed of light and put you in a state
*  of at the same time, being correlated with David seeing a live cat and being correlated with David
*  seeing dead cat, even before you're consciously aware of the answer to that. So the earth as a
*  whole, the solar system as a whole pretty soon, is at the same time cat alive and cat alive going
*  on and cat dead cat dead going on. And each of those terms separately is not interacting with
*  the other one in any meaningful sense. They're not the way in which quantum superposition quantum
*  two things at once show up as two things at once is through interference effects that we can do
*  between the two, which whereby somehow things can reinforce or cancel out. So somehow,
*  the live cat bits could cancel out from the dead cat bits could reinforce that can't happen here.
*  The one systems get big enough, this is more thermodynamic irreversibility, actually,
*  but once things systems get big enough, you just can't do those kinds of interference,
*  there were too many moving parts to, to, to, to mesh up like that. So, so what you've really got
*  is two, two chunks of physical reality. Each, each one is not interacting with the other one.
*  And each one looks like structurally is isomorphic to has the same shape as
*  what things would be like if an ordinary definite classical thing was going on.
*  So the world is two ordinary classical definite things going on at the same time.
*  And we need to know the universe is we need a term for some big chunk of reality
*  that's doing its own thing and not really interacting with other big chunks of reality.
*  World and branch are quite good terms for that. Yeah, but they're emergent. I mean,
*  my book on this is the emergent multiverse. It's not the sort of fundamental of the other
*  deepest level of reality multiverse, the all of this kind of multiple things happening at the same
*  time is just more of that higher level autonomous goings on that we were talking about earlier in
*  the podcast. It's just there's more than one bit of it at a time. Right. And actually, it's worth
*  saying for potential skeptics in the audience, if you signed on to the previous discussion about
*  these emergent structures and how they could have autonomous laws, then you're most of the way to
*  signing on to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It's a very similar thing.
*  Yeah, I mean, this was one of my original arguments for many worlds in philosophy, like
*  way back when I was kind of making that jump from being a physics graduate student that
*  once you accepted the freight, the basic rules of how emergence worked in physics,
*  and you apply them to unitary, unmodified quantum mechanics, the many worlds just more or less
*  happened. They weren't something you put into the theory, they were just given to you structurally,
*  by the way it was set up. And so conversely, if you will come to positive view, if you want to
*  reject the ever interpretation, you're in some danger of rejecting rather general rules about how
*  theories at different levels are related and rules that we use pretty much all over science,
*  if we rules such that if we didn't use them, a lot of science would just stop working.
*  But now I get to ask you like all these tricky annoying questions because you
*  helped yourself to a very simple example of Ferdinger's cat, which by the way,
*  fans of the Mindscape podcast can buy a t-shirt with Ferdinger's cat on it at the
*  Mindscape merch store. Although my cat is alive, is awake and asleep versus alive and
*  a dead because I don't like to kill the cat. Well, you have cats, don't you?
*  Exactly. Yes. There's room for cat people. But when the observational outcome is not
*  something that only has two possible outcomes, but is continuous, like the position of a particle,
*  is branching happening all the time? And can we even count the number of branches?
*  Yeah. And I don't think we can count them, or at least we can't count them non-arbitrarily. I mean,
*  look, the cat is an example of this really. I'm going to stick with the brutal version of the
*  original Schrodinger's cat. Apologies to cat lovers. I mean, there are many ways in which that
*  cyanide capture can break. And come to that, there are many times at which the event can happen.
*  But the way people tend to tell Schrodinger's cat in physics classes these days is you make
*  a measurement of some particle and according to the outcome, the cat lives or dies. It's very
*  clean. It's very discrete. But Schrodinger's original one had a radioisotope. So we didn't
*  actually get a discrete breaking into live cat and dead cat. We got a live cat plus a kind of
*  continuum worth of dying cats who die at different times. So how do you analyze that in the kind of
*  emergent story I was telling? Well, you can't literally treat it as a continuum. If you want
*  to say that, take two, I want to separate the various dead cat states into states that differ
*  by 10 to the minus 25 seconds. So that would work. On those timescales, the kind of quantum
*  coherence of the radioactive decay matters. The degree to which the wavelength of the decayed
*  particles requires constructive interference to make sense of it. It means if you try to break
*  the world up onto worlds that are that finely grained, then my claim earlier on that there's
*  no interaction between these worlds, no interference effects between them stops being true. At that
*  grain of analysis, there's interference. So I can't think of the cat state as being decomposed into
*  branches that differ by 10 to the minus 25 seconds. I slightly pulled that number out of the air.
*  I wouldn't swear to the physics. There's a timescale such that that's true. Let's call it 10 to the
*  minus 25 seconds. If I decide to do it on 10 to the minus six seconds, it's fine. The relevant
*  coherence times for radioactive decay are much shorter than that. So I can definitely regard
*  the cat state as a superposition of hundreds of millions of dead cat branches
*  differing by 10 to the minus six seconds. Can I get it down to 10 to the minus 12 seconds? Yeah,
*  probably. Can I get 10 to the minus 18 seconds? I'm not sure. There's no exactly sharp line where
*  that stops working. There'll come a point when interference becomes such that the description
*  in terms of branches becomes unuseful. That's the point to which there won't be an autonomous
*  high level dynamics description. That's the point to which the kind of real pattern stuff that
*  Dad Eddard talks about that you were talking about earlier that's sort of my general license to say
*  I've got higher level goings on. That license is revoked at the point at which you get to that
*  finer grain. But on a coarser grain than that, everything's fine. And there'll be intermediate
*  points where you can kind of get away with it, but it's a bit fuzzier than you might like.
*  And so depending on your tolerance for error and the degree of precision in which you care,
*  you're going to reach different conclusions as to exactly how finely you want to break things up.
*  But the basic claim that there's a vast number of different cats
*  is robust against those various ways of precisifying it.
*  And there's a lesson or a philosophy implicit here. Maybe you made it explicit. But look,
*  these branches are just kind of approximations. They're useful ways of talking about things,
*  and you can't demand too much precision of them, just like you can't demand too much precision of
*  treating the gas in a box as a fluid rather than a bunch of atoms.
*  That's exactly right. I mean, this is the this is them again, this general lesson about emergence
*  being brought into quantum mechanics. It's just systematically true that emergent accounts have
*  fuzz and slightly blurry boundaries, and no really sharp exact rules as to where you divide them out.
*  That's nothing to do with quantum mechanics. That's just generally how the world is structured.
*  I mean, there's a kind of there's a kind of temptation in talking about quantum mechanics
*  and talking about many worlds in particular is less now perhaps there was but it's still around
*  to say that there's two options either something needs to be exactly and precisely defined in my
*  microscopic physics, or it needs to be an illusion. But hardly anything in the world fits those
*  categories. You know, you and I are not exactly in precise to find there is no Sean David interaction
*  term in the Lagrangian standard model. And yet we're not illusory, or at least if we are,
*  then the word illusion becomes a loses its value. And everything higher level has this fuzziness to
*  it. And again, the many worlds branches just have that fuzziness in the same kind of way.
*  But the thing the things that are that are still true, no matter how much you, how much you sort
*  of tweak the setup, those are the best things. So it's robustly true that Schrodinger's cat splits
*  into a vast number of branches. It is not the vastly true that the exact number of those branches
*  is 10 to the power of 25 or 10 to the power of 18 is it's robustly true that there are at least
*  hundreds of millions of them. It's robustly true that there aren't 10 to the power of 100 of them.
*  But there's no there's no robustness in the middle. Now, I should confess, I mean, various of my more
*  of my sort of more purest metaphysically inclined colleagues are tearing their hair at this point,
*  because the metaphysics here is chaos. But I think I think our metaphysics has to be responsive to
*  our science. So to some extent, insofar as we need to change the way our metaphysics work to make sense
*  of that kind of way of talking, that that has to be changed in that way to do justice to science.
*  And you you seemed to have an implicit answer to this question and something you said earlier,
*  but there's the question of when the branching happens, how quickly does it spread? Should we
*  think of the branching as being simultaneous in some arbitrarily chosen reference frame throughout
*  the universe? Like when Alice and Bob are far apart with their entangled spins, and they're
*  going to measure them when Alice measures hers, does Bob split instantly? Or is there some speed
*  of light delay there? Or is that a human construction and we can choose it either way?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of somewhere in between. And it's it's sort of trades on an ambiguity about
*  what we mean by branches here that doesn't matter in small systems, but matters when you've got the
*  Alice Bob situation. So here's something that doesn't depend on how you set it up. The quantum
*  state of the region of space time containing Alice will not change until until light has had a chance
*  to cross the gap from the region of space time describing Bob. And that's the that's the
*  fundamental lower or more fundamental lower level description before we start talking about branches.
*  There's a bit of branching, you talk about a classical space timer, Alice and Bob, but
*  at the level we're thinking about, we're not we're not thinking branching here. And if you describe
*  in branching terms, the way I prefer to talk would be to say that I want to think my branch,
*  my piece of emergent structure is something that's expanding on the forward light cone.
*  So Alice branches her future there. The branching spreads out from Alice at the speed of the
*  fastest interaction that's doing the branching in practice, that's going to always going to be
*  like for big systems. And Bob also has branching happening. And eventually those light cones
*  crossover and the Alice light cone, so I'm using my hands here as podcast. The Alice light cone
*  crosses Bob, the Bob light cone crosses Alice. And then Alice and Bob split again. So Alice and Bob
*  experienced two sequential splitting events, one when they do their own measurement and one where
*  they come into the causal feature of the other measurement. But sometimes it's convenient to
*  talk more globally, if you want to write down a quantum state and say, we'll do we'll break this
*  state into Alice Bob, both gets been up plus Alice Bob, both gets been down plus Alice gets been up,
*  Bob gets been down plus Bob gets spin up, Alice gets been down. Then we'll want to use a global
*  notion of branching. But at that point, we're no longer picking out a sort of robust high level
*  feature anymore. We've added a piece of pure convention. And the piece of convention is
*  picked up exactly what you were saying earlier, that we've chosen an arbitrary efforts frame.
*  So, so we could we could talk that way now if you want to, but nothing, nothing physical is happening
*  instantaneously, even at the emergent higher level sense. There is something happening at
*  the emergent high level sense, but only on the forward light cones of the measurement.
*  Okay, at least this is the way I think about it. Yeah, no, I think it's a perfectly I think,
*  it is interesting, because it is a kind of a pressure point of emergence and subjectivity
*  and objectivity and all these things. So it you know, again, for the youngsters in the audience,
*  there's work to be done in thinking about these things. It's not all figured out yet. And we
*  haven't, you know, to bring it all back and close the circle. We started this by saying that the
*  quantum measurement process is a manifestly time irreversible process. So how do you explain that,
*  Mr. Everett? Right? Well, it's, I don't necessarily know the answer. I mean,
*  I'll give you a classic philosophy. To a bigger unsolved problem. Okay. So claim this branching
*  is a special case of thermodynamic irreversibility. That goes back partly to what I was saying earlier
*  about the self same equations happening in different contexts, but we, we can break it
*  down more physically. The here's the kind of argument you might give as to as to why
*  Schrodinger's cat causes everything to branch out from it. I mean, you know,
*  a random photon is coming in towards Schrodinger's cat if the it's coming in from outer space,
*  let's say that if the cat is alive, the photo then the cat standing up the photon bounces off the cat.
*  If the cat's dead, the photon passed harmlessly past the cat and bounces off something different.
*  And so now the quantum state before the photon arrived was this is the very first photon is
*  cat alive plus cat dead photon coming in the quantum state afterwards is cat alive photon bounced
*  off cat plus cat dead photon missed cat and this is an entangled state. It's a joint state of both
*  of them. The photon is now recording the quantum state of the cat. And then the idea is millions
*  more photons come in and to a higher and higher degree, the cat is just thoroughly entangled all
*  these photos. Okay, but suppose we run that process backwards. The backwards description of what's
*  going on would be something like initially, the photon is entangled quantum mechanically tangled
*  up with the cat. And so the total quantum state is something like a photon coming in a one trajectory
*  dead cat plus photon coming in on a different trajectory live cat. And if you evolve that
*  through the photon coming in on the live cat trajectory bounces off the live cat, the photo
*  coming on the dead cat trajectory keeps going. And now I've got a single photon coming out no
*  longer entangled with cat. And if every single photon was coming in in quantum states like that,
*  then at the end of all that process, the cat would have started in this ridiculously entangled
*  state. At the end of the process, the cat would have been completely pure. So why do we think one
*  of those happens rather than the other happens? Well, in some sense, we think that that incredibly
*  delicately entangled state of cat and all the million photons is just a ridiculously implausible,
*  ridiculously unlikely way for the system to have started off. Whereas the state with just all the
*  photons coming in any which way, that was a perfectly natural reasonable state for the system
*  to have started in. But as I've kind of shown, that's an explicitly time directed assumption.
*  The state that I said is completely outrageous is just the reverse of the state the system will
*  in fact get into in the future. The state I said was perfectly normal was one that I would have
*  got into if I ran the ridiculously outrageous state backwards. And all of this is exactly
*  analogous to the likelihood of the atoms in a glass of water being ready to make an ice cube
*  form spontaneously. Absolutely. I'd say it's not even analogous. It's the same thing. It's just
*  being applied to a different problem. There are some slight quantum subtleties, but basically it's
*  the same thing. So the very same things that drive irreversibility in the ice cube drive the fact the
*  system's branch rather than re-emerging. I mean, again, back to the thing you said right at the
*  beginning is do I distinguish different hours of time? This is one of the reasons I don't really.
*  If you start talking about the quantum hour of time and the statistical mechanical hour of time,
*  you kid yourself into thinking these are different things.
*  Well, to non-Everettians, they might be different things, right?
*  That's fair. That's fair. Although it also shows why Everett is-
*  Better.
*  Better, yeah. It shows why there are awkwardnesses in not being Everettian. Let me put it that way.
*  Because these things about the way systems naturally evolve in Dikehir are happening anyway,
*  it's kind of weird if separately from that you've got an entirely different mechanism
*  that really imposes the direction. I mean, if you have some different explanation of the
*  arrow here, you have to ask how does that mesh with the Dikehir story?
*  Because it's going to happen anyway.
*  It's empirically tested. I mean, not for cats, but for mesoscopic systems.
*  So just to restate that, the thing about Everett, whether it's the fact that there is branching or
*  it fits into this bigger statistical mechanical picture, is that all of the processes you need
*  to make Everett work will also happen in everyone else's version of quantum mechanics
*  or statistical mechanics or whatever. But then they're saying, and I have extra processes also
*  because it makes me feel better somehow about the explanation.
*  Yeah. I mean, I could make the case for defense against that, but yeah, that's the basic thing.
*  We're among friends here. But okay, so I'll get back to a difficult question then.
*  How do you think about the past hypothesis in these quantum mechanical
*  terms? Is it just one past hypothesis for the early universe and its wave function?
*  Or do we have to be more subtle about different senses in which the early universe had low entropy?
*  Well, this goes back to why I would rather not place the past hypothesis as a statement
*  about low entropy. I would rather put the statement about not having lots of delicate
*  correlations. I think the past hypothesis is a kind of cosmic version of the hypothesis that
*  all the incoming photons were not complicatedly entangled. If our past hypothesis that the initial
*  quantum state was a relatively simple state without a bunch of complicated entanglements,
*  that's probably mostly what we need. Good. So actually, in fact, that's perfect because
*  we can wrap up the conversation by going back to the weeds that we were in a little bit ago that
*  I said, let's defer that. I think we could do it now because let me try to say, if I understand
*  what you're saying in slightly different words, then you can tell me whether I've gotten it
*  completely wrong or not. There's a version of the past hypothesis that just says the early universe
*  had low entropy. Oh, and by the way, it was in a low entropy state that within its macro state
*  was pretty generic. It wasn't just low entropy. It was low entropy without any secret conspiracies
*  that was going to make it even lower entropy. That's one version of the past hypothesis.
*  And there's another version that says, look, we look and we see the cosmic microwave background
*  in our telescopes. It's true that if the question you asked was, of all the ways you could have seen
*  that, what do most of them look like? And of all the ways the early universe could have been to
*  give us this image in our telescopes, what do most of them look like? And most of them look
*  wildly inhomogeneous with crazy fluctuations and gravitational differences from here to there,
*  but there were structure in the specific microstate that cancelled all that out so that we see smooth
*  radiation in our telescopes. And your point, if I understand it, is sure, if the question you're
*  asking is just what do most such early universe states look like conditioned on what we see,
*  that's the answer you get. But if you add to that a requirement that what do most early universe
*  states that didn't have crazy correlations in them and conspiracies look like that would give
*  us our state today, then you automatically can derive the fact that, oh, it had to be pretty
*  low entropy in our coarse-grained sense. Was I close there? Yeah, that sounds right. Put it this
*  way, if the early universe was in a non-crazy microscopic state, then something like the
*  second law holds and the macroscopic dynamics for that universe have edge be going up.
*  And once you've got the macroscopic dynamics have edge be going up, then obviously the entropy of
*  the early universe has to be learned in the entropy of the present universe.
*  Good. Yeah. So I think that I have not really sat and chewed on that different formulation
*  much myself, but I'm not objecting to it. I'm not philosophically opposed to it. I think it makes
*  perfect sense. And in fact, it leads to, I already said this is the final thing, but we have another
*  final thing now. It leads into this, the questions that arise in the other direction of time. We've
*  been talking about the past, but we also have the future. There are some of my best friends who
*  worry about the fact that in the future we have a positive cosmological constant that is making the
*  universe accelerate. Everything will eventually empty out and we're in what looks like equilibrium
*  in some sense, just empty space. Dissider space is the technical term. But dissider space has a
*  non-zero temperature according to Stephen Hawking and Gary Gibbons in the 1970s. So there could be
*  random fluctuations. And if you wait a very, very long time, you will get fluctuations into
*  Boltzmann brains or even entire Boltzmann galaxies or universes and so forth. So are we
*  worried about getting back to the recurrence objection that Zermelo gave to Boltzmann years
*  ago where if you say the universe started 14 billion years ago, but lasts infinity years to
*  the future, who cares about the first 14 billion years? Most of the occurrences of people like us
*  will be random fluctuations in the future. Is that something that you personally lose sleep over?
*  I lose sleep over states it, but I think it's a serious concern. I think it's a little subtle
*  whether it's true partly for reasons about what fluctuation really means in an ever-changing
*  universe that you've talked about, partly because ultimately this is probably a physics that
*  is tentative enough that we should be cautious about it. But yeah, notwithstanding all of that,
*  there is something concerning about it, I think. If the universe is such that it predicts that
*  it's full of beings who have, not only fake histories, but entirely true histories that
*  come from fluctuations of their own galaxy into existence or something. I think there's some
*  reason to be worried that the theory is self-underminding. I mean, look, in a certain
*  sense, there's a bunch of problems I think that come up in physics where we use infinity pretty
*  casually in physics. Mostly we use infinity as a convenient approximation for large finite things.
*  I mean, particle physicists talk about collisions between particles and then we see what happens at
*  infinity. Some philosophers, if you know better, worry about exactly how you formulate those
*  infinities. But as my colleague Porter Williams says, the main tube of the LHC is about three
*  meters wide. Whatever at infinity is, it's much less than three meters. So in case like that,
*  all we really mean is something like much bigger than the scales we're interested in.
*  It's easier to approximate things by infinity than by some large finite number. Every now and
*  then a real infinity turns up. When our theory has real infinity, in this case, the literally
*  infinite future of the De Sitte universe, then I think at some level, I'm not certain we know how
*  to theorize about things of that kind. That's not to say therefore we should be relaxed about
*  the Boltzmann brains that you talk about. It's more the opposite. So this is a reminder to us
*  that in positing something that's really infinite, whether it's infinite into the time like future or
*  infinite into space, it's not that posits illegitimate, but that posits is a very substantial
*  deep thing that goes beyond our mathematical use of infinities in other places. And we're right to
*  kind of pause and worry about it. Yeah, I think that's actually very much in line with my own
*  view on these things. It's not a showstopper for anything. It's a reminder. There are things we
*  don't understand and we shouldn't be too glib about them. Some of my colleagues in cosmology
*  think that it's a reminder that you've lost your mind that you worry about these things. So for
*  the truly very final answer, are you mostly encouraged or mostly discouraged by the relationship
*  between philosophy and physics these days? Do you think that there's been more overlap that's been
*  constructive or are you spend more of your mental energy sort of frustrated that it's not even better?
*  I'm mostly positive about it. I mean, I said testing that question reflects more people's
*  natural disposition than their objective judgment of the field. My feeling is the philosophy of
*  physics has upped its game and has, or bits of it at least have increasingly engaged with questions
*  in physics that genuinely bother physicists. And I think conversely, physicists, it's not true that
*  physicists are not bothered about conceptual problems. They're not bothered about conceptual
*  problems that have seen a sterile. And I think the quantum measurement problem has traditionally
*  often seen sterile to physicists. It doesn't seem to lead to something. But without having time to
*  talk about what this is, imagine your listeners come across it. I mean, the black hole information
*  loss paradox has had the finest minds in theoretical physics tearing their hair out over it for the
*  better part of 50 years. And it's a conceptual problem. It's not a calculation issue. So it's
*  not these things that matter. And I think if you can come to the table in that conversation
*  with something to contribute, then I think you can relatively easily get across the prejudice
*  that can occur. I mean, I think you do run into genuine prejudices. I think it helps to say the
*  word conceptual rather than philosophical. I think it helps to have a physics PhD,
*  more because you could say I have a physics PhD because of any concrete knowledge you got from it.
*  But I think it could be done. I think they're a good conversation to have and a lot of people
*  are willing to talk. And I think, because I've mostly put that in terms of what are the issues
*  of engaging physicists, I think it is true that philosophy of physics has some bad habits of its
*  own here that it can help get over. I think philosophy of physics has this slightly awkward
*  situation where mainstream physicists are not naturally inclined to talk to them. But people in
*  in much more niche areas of physics who are struggling themselves to get physicists to talk
*  to them are much more willing to talk to philosophers. And so philosophy of physics to a
*  degree that concerns me sometimes can often be a philosophy of dissident physics, or minority
*  physics, which isn't to diss any of that. I mean, we don't do science by majority vote. But it does
*  often mean that the centre of gravity and energy in philosophy of physics often struggles to be on
*  the conceptual questions that physicists really care about. So yeah, I mean, that's a kind of
*  cautious optimism about it. I think there's still problems. I think there are institutional
*  structural problems. And I also think bluntly many people doing philosophy of physics, or who
*  want to do philosophy of physics, aren't necessarily always doing the homework to actually get on top of
*  things to the degree that they don't make relatively elementary technical errors that
*  will be seen correctly as invalidating what they're doing by physicists they're engaging with. So
*  ultimately doing interdisciplinary work is hard. You have to collaborate, you have to talk to other
*  people, you have to put the time in. And there's always a prejudice on both sides against it that
*  you have to deal with. But yeah, I'm kind of optimistic. I think the best days are ahead of
*  it for that point of view. You did a good job of being optimistic for them being very cautiously
*  optimistic. But we will take that for what we're looking for here. So David Wallace,
*  thanks very much for being on the Winescape Podcast. Thanks for having me.
