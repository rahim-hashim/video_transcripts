Humans build machines, in part, to relieve themselves from the burden of work on difficult, repetitive tasks. And yet, despite the fact that machines are everywhere, most of us are still working pretty hard. But maybe that’s about to change. Futurists like John Danaher believe that society is finally on the brink of making a transition to a world in which work would be optional, rather than mandatory — and he thinks that’s a very good thing. It will take some adjusting, personally as well as economically, but he envisions a future in which human creativity and artistic impulse can flourish in a world free of the demands of working for a living. We talk about what that would entail, whether it’s realistic, and what comes next.

John Danaher received an LLM degree from Trinity College Dublin and a Ph.D. from University College, Cork. He is currently Senior Lecturer in the School of Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway. His research is situated at the overlap of legal studies and philosophy, and frequently involves questions of technology, automation, and the future. He is the coeditor of Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications, and author of the recent book Automation and Utopia: Human Flourishing in a World Without Work. He writes frequently for publications such as The Atlantic, The Guardian, and The Irish Times, and is the host of his own podcast, Philosophical Disquisitions.

# Mindscape 97 | John Danaher on Our Coming Automated Utopia
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsZhESz0GEM)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean
*  Carroll. If you were following the presidential primary campaign here in
*  the United States here in 2020, one of the most unusual candidates was Andrew
*  Yang who had a set of very specific interesting messages that we don't
*  usually hear in presidential campaigns. He was very concerned in particular about
*  the oncoming wave of automation that is going to change the nature of the
*  So his idea was that robots or automated technologies more generally would
*  gradually replace people's jobs and therefore we had to provide a universal
*  basic income to let people live and flourish in a world that had much less
*  work in it. So aside from what economic policy you think is the best idea, this
*  question of whether or not automation really will replace people's jobs is a
*  very important one. So that's what we're going to discuss today. Our guest is
*  John Danaher who's a senior lecturer in the law school at the National
*  University of Ireland and his interests are in the intersection of law,
*  neuroscience, technology, especially artificial intelligence and so forth.
*  John has his own podcast called Philosophical Disquisitions that you can
*  find a link to in the blog post and he's written a book called Automation and
*  Utopia, Human Flourishing in a World Without Work. So to put it very
*  simplistically, we'll get into more details in the podcast of course, but
*  basically John says yes automation is coming, yes it's going to put us all out
*  of work and yes that is awesome because once we don't need to work we can do all
*  these other wonderful things and so the question is well what are these
*  wonderful things, will we really do them, will we feel fulfilled without a job to
*  go to nine to five, is there some moral hazard associated with not being a
*  working person, with having all the leisure time you want? So John tries to
*  make the argument that it's actually kind of the good thing that you might
*  expect naively, you're still allowed to work, you could do things, but we'll have
*  a much better society and much better individual lives when we can choose what
*  work to do, what work not to do. It's extremely thought-provoking and very
*  futuristic in a down-to-earth way, this is something that might actually be
*  approaching us. So it's important I think to think these issues through to be
*  prepared for what might be a very very dramatic change in how we organize human
*  society. I should note that we had an audio issue for the first 20 minutes of
*  this podcast, it's not really bad it's just that the wrong microphone was
*  getting used so and then we switch after 20 minutes is over so if you persevere
*  through the first 20 minutes the audio quality will get a lot better just
*  because despite both being podcasters the technology sometimes baffles us and
*  with that let's go.
*  John Danaher, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Thank you, Sean, it's a pleasure
*  to be here. I'm actually a big fan of this podcast so it's a bit of a thrill
*  Well before I forget we should advocate your podcast, right? Do you have one?
*  I do, yes. So I run a blog called Philosophical Disquisitions. It's a
*  cumbersome title but I picked it years ago and I'm sticking with it and I have
*  a podcast of the same name associated with that. It's mainly about philosophy of
*  technology and the ethics of technology but I do some occasional audio essays
*  about other topics. Cool, we will definitely link to it in the blog post
*  I put up for this episode but speaking of technology and philosophy and so
*  forth but you're not a professional philosopher or is that your training?
*  You're in a law school, right? Yeah, so I'm not a philosopher by training, I'm
*  more by application I suppose. My typical joke is that to lawyers I'm a
*  philosopher and to philosophers I'm a lawyer. Oh I know that one well, yes. Okay
*  so we're gonna get into this story that you advocate about giving
*  ourselves over to the robots taking over and why that might be a good thing but I
*  wanted to start as you start in the book because you have some great numbers, some
*  great stories to really drive home how fast things are changing. Just to
*  quote one you say that a hundred thousand, sorry ten thousand years ago
*  the percentage of the vertebrate biomass on earth that was either human beings or
*  our controlled animals, right, our livestock and our pets was 0.1% of the vertebrate
*  biomass on earth and by now it's closer to 98%. So we have won, the human
*  beings have taken over, is that safe to say? Yeah so that's a statistic that I
*  recount it's actually something that Daniel Dennett uses a lot in talks of
*  his so that's where I got it from and since I published the book people have
*  pointed out to me that it I don't know if that's a fully reliable statistic
*  whether it really is 98% it's an estimate based on a number of assumptions that
*  could be questionable but I think the general gist of it which is that humans
*  and human livestock and animals and human agriculture now really dominate
*  the planet in an unprecedented way in comparison to what was the case before
*  the agricultural revolution. Yeah I'm willing to believe that it's not 98% but
*  we're arguing about whether it's 96% not whether it's 40% like it is most of
*  what's going on here on earth right now I would think and then you go through the
*  various revolutions we've had with agriculture and technology and so forth
*  and it really drives home not just human dominance of the planet but how rapidly
*  it is all happening right? Right and people have are probably familiar with
*  some of these graphs that you show of you know the number of calories consumed
*  or burned per person per country since the Industrial Revolution and you see
*  this hockey stick like graph where if you zoom out it looks like nothing happened
*  until 1750 and suddenly everything is happening. And even 10,000 years is an
*  incredibly short time historically speaking I mean the lesson I take from
*  this that is relevant to where we're gonna go in the conversation is we are
*  nowhere near equilibrium right like our situation is incredibly rapidly changing
*  and therefore we have every justification for imagining that a
*  thousand years from now things are gonna be dramatically dramatically
*  different in some way whether or not we can predict what that way is gonna be.
*  Right yeah so the the assumption that the future is gonna look much like the
*  past at least at a certain time horizon looks like a a dubious assumption you
*  know I don't know if this is a good idea to bring it up but I was just listening
*  to your interview with Martin Reiss which was released this week which just
*  probably means nothing by the time this comes out I don't know when this will
*  actually come out but he made the similar point about you know people building
*  cathedrals in the Middle Ages why did they do that when they wouldn't live to
*  see them because they presumed that their children would live in a very
*  similar world and appreciate the same things and how nowadays that assumption
*  looks a lot of us are questioning that more because it feels like the future
*  might be radically different from the past. Yeah absolutely and you know by
*  the way it is always appropriate to mention previous podcast episodes that
*  we've done and and you can do the same thing for your own podcast episodes
*  that's that's perfectly fine. So the part of this rapid change that you care about
*  is broadly construed automation or I guess more specifically the effect it's
*  having on jobs and work you know we used to be hunter-gatherers and basically
*  everyone had a job either hunting or gathering or doing the support work for
*  hunters and gatherers and things have changed a lot I mean why don't you just
*  give us your potted quick explanation of how work has changed over the years.
*  Yeah the basic story is that the tasks that humans used to perform are
*  increasingly being performed by machines or through kind of a lot of technological
*  assistance so even if you don't have tasks that are fully automated you have
*  tasks that are automated to such a percentage that the human performed
*  element of the task it is quite limited and you can see this in many different
*  sectors of society so that's one of the things I tried to do in the opening
*  chapter of this book so I'm going to sketch different domains of society and how we're
*  seeing this trend towards what I call human obsolescence it's probably you know
*  a dramatic way of putting it or a strong way of putting it but I think the trend
*  is very clear again agriculture if you want to start with that example you have
*  fairly precipitous declines in the number of human beings employed in
*  agriculture since the 1800s or 1900s you know most European economies in the US
*  majority of workers worked in agriculture in the 1800s up until the
*  early 1900s and now we're talking about less than 5% of humans employed in
*  agriculture yeah that's a these are statistics actually that I based from
*  they're called Max Rauser our world and data he has a lot of nice charts and
*  information about this similar story to in mountain manufacturing although I
*  think there it's much more apparent to people because manufacturing is one of
*  the industries that has most clearly automated because the signs of
*  automation are so so visible there so the stereotypical image of the
*  production line like a motor car factory or something is a clear illustration of
*  this trend towards automation we also see it in other areas so I look at the
*  the rise of kind of automated assistance in medicine in law law as well and also
*  in science I talk about some examples and you're more familiar with this than
*  I would be but there are clearly increasingly science is a big data
*  enterprise of lots of computerized systems with performing statistical
*  analysis and calculations but there's also some initial evidence that we're
*  creating robots that can perform their own experiments as a team and university
*  and a lab or West with in Wales that have created these robots Adam and Eve
*  that run their own experiments they come up with their own hypotheses and test
*  their own sorry experimentally test these hypotheses reach conclusion so
*  it's a time when we're seeing this kind of rapid trend towards automation in
*  many different sectors and oftentimes when people discuss this topic they
*  focus on just one sector of society rather than all of them and one of the
*  things I wanted to do is try and give a wide sketch of all these different
*  domains of activity yeah actually I really liked an example that you had
*  which is completely obvious and I feel bad for sort of not just figuring it out
*  myself but the financial trading literally on the floor of the New York
*  Stock Exchange the idea that that is more or less gone away and now we just
*  use the stock exchange as a backdrop for video cameras you know TV shows and
*  things like that but all of it has become automated in the real world I
*  mean I knew that intellectually but the vivid picture of the trading floor more
*  or less disappearing really hit home yeah so this notion that the trading
*  floor is a place where you got lots of people crowded together barking buy and
*  sell orders at each other kind of the image you see in movie from the 1980s
*  trading places with Eddie Murphy and oh yeah classic Dan Aykroyd you know there's
*  that's the stereotypical view of the market nowadays yes most trading activity
*  takes place digitally and in fact most trading activity is performed by by
*  algorithms the estimates are a little bit tricky here but most people assume
*  on pretty good grounds it's more than 50% of all trades are executed by
*  algorithms yeah yeah I mean like I said I sort of knew this intellectually but
*  after reading your book I was moved to go look at the data here now it was I
*  think it's true that this literal size of the New York Stock Exchange floor
*  peaked in the 1990s it expanded but then it's been shrinking ever since they've
*  literally been you know cutting off the floor space because they need it less
*  and less so that says something about how our society is changing yeah I mean
*  there's also there's a regulatory reason for that as well which is just to do with
*  the nationalization of markets in the US so that the the physical location of New
*  York is less important than it ever was partly due to technology but also
*  partly due to changes in regulation well it's always these details that make the
*  story a little bit less romantic but okay but okay so that I mean that gives
*  us a bit of a background and I think that probably most listeners get it that
*  there's a lot of more automation but let's be let's dig into what it does
*  mean across the different sectors I mean I have this feeling that throughout the
*  last several hundred years this and that particular industry has become automated
*  but it's always been the case that jobs for human beings have popped up
*  somewhere else right like we've lost a lot of farming jobs and a lot of
*  industrial jobs but there's jobs than doing other things that have popped up
*  and you're trying to make the much stronger case that we're entering a zone
*  where some jobs will be automated and there won't be replacements for them and
*  the total number of jobs to be done by humans is going to precipitously decline
*  yeah I mean I think you have to be a little bit careful when we talk about
*  this topic so I'm gonna do maybe something boring and philosophical which
*  is to define some of the terms that get bandied abound in please no we appreciate
*  that you've come to the right podcast right so I mean I frame my discussion in
*  the book about the automation of work and I do that partly because that's the
*  way in which a lot of people talk about it and but it is a little bit misleading
*  in the sense that work is a very vague term and people mean different things by
*  it so what I mean by it is the performance of skills in return for some
*  kind of economic reward so at least for me work isn't any particular activity or
*  task it is rather a condition under which humans perform tasks so it's a
*  little bit of an abstract notion and a job then is effectively a socially or
*  economically defined role that is made up of a bunch of tasks things that you
*  do and which you then receive some kind of economic reward in return for doing
*  those tasks so you know if you're a taxi driver you drive people around from here
*  to there according to their wishes you might small talk with them or something
*  so these are all tasks that make up that that job and when we talk about the
*  automation of work and the automation of jobs it's the it's misleading to assume
*  this technology necessarily displaces work and necessarily to place
*  displaces jobs because what technology really does is it tends to change the
*  tasks that make up jobs and make up work and so right so this kind of links into
*  your point which is that because jobs are really defined as collections of
*  tasks we might automate 40% of those tasks but there's oftentimes other tasks
*  that humans can move into and that are often humans have a comparative
*  advantage in performing relative to machines so automation doesn't
*  necessarily lead to the displacement of jobs we can sometimes redefine our roles
*  so that we can focus on different tasks and so this is what we see historically
*  is that technology has very clearly had a disruptive impact on lots of jobs but
*  it hasn't necessarily led to wide-scale unemployment because people have moved
*  into other kinds of jobs that are defined by different sets of tasks and
*  some economists refer to this as the the complementarity effect of technology so
*  a lot of times we focus on the substitution effect of technology that technology substitutes for human labor
*  but oftentimes it there's a there are complementary tasks human can perform
*  alongside machines that can opens up a whole vista or new space of work for the
*  future and this is why we haven't seen this trend towards structural unemployment
*  over the long term as a result of technology
*  yeah I mean I think the point that jobs as a category are socially constructed
*  it's a very good one right it's not literally something that needs to be done
*  it's a way we're choosing to organize our society to give people reward monetary
*  rewards for doing these tasks like you say so if that's true how can we ever say
*  that we're confident that jobs are going to go away or that you know the the
*  need for human beings to do jobs will become less and less can we always invent
*  new constructions of what we mean by a job yeah I mean so it's possible that
*  you read my book is starting for the extreme thesis that all work is going
*  away but what I would say is that I don't think that's something that
*  necessarily happens I think something that depends to a large extent on how
*  society responds to automation so I'm not a technological determinist or
*  fatalist about these things I think there are choices that we make
*  individually societally and institutionally that will make a
*  difference to this as to whether we always find new jobs but I am skeptical
*  about the potential for us to always find new complementary tasks that humans
*  can perform alongside robots or AI which will be solutions for kind of mass
*  employment and I mean there are a few different reasons for my skepticism and
*  I discussed four of them in the book one is just that there is some preliminary
*  data suggesting that when employers turn to robots or automation it doesn't tend
*  to increase the overall level of work or doesn't have a neutral effect on work it
*  tends to actually reduce the number of workers demanded so there's some
*  interesting empirical work done by Darren Acemoglu and Pascal Rastrepo I
*  think they're both in MIT and they did work on the US labor markets where they
*  suggested that for every robot a company uses in the US it tends to
*  displace either between three and six workers so there's a kind of net loss of
*  employment that was data based on from 1990 to 2007 and then more more recently
*  they did a study of French companies who automated and they saw a similar effect
*  number one that these these companies tended to increase their productivity
*  pretty dramatically and they had a larger share of the overall productivity
*  in the French market and also they tended to reduce the number of workers
*  that they employed so there is that initial empirical data it's just two
*  studies I mentioned in here which suggests that the use of robots in
*  particular doesn't lead to gains or neutral level of employment it seems to
*  lead to net losses overall. But isn't that I mean I think I'm sort of just
*  pushing a little bit because I'm probably gonna agree with your thesis
*  overall but that data seems to indicate that within those particular industries
*  robots came in and human beings went out but then other industries come up right
*  I mean we have kinds of jobs we didn't have before so but you want to argue
*  that we're at a point now where I think you want to argue tell me that it's good
*  that jobs are going away that we should imagine moving toward a future where we
*  don't even we're not sad that there are fewer jobs for human beings. Right I mean
*  just to say one thing on the empirical evidence so A. Smoglo and Ristrepo do
*  look at the scenarios to whether there are jobs being created in other sectors
*  of the economy at least when they did the study in the US and they didn't find
*  net gain so when they looked within particular industries they saw a higher
*  level of net loss but even when they looked across industries they saw a
*  still a net loss overall for every robot employed today. And one of their points
*  which I think is good is that this is at a point in time when there's actually
*  been relatively little use of robots so from 1990 to 2007 there was relatively
*  little uptake of robotization in the US industries and since then it's actually
*  increasing and we probably expect it to increase in the future so that's just
*  Yeah maybe we should also talk about just to make things a little bit more
*  concrete what are the kinds of jobs where it's easy to imagine robots
*  taking over or automation taking over and the ones where it's hard. You
*  mentioned fruit picking as one where it's hard but it's never less becoming
*  true perhaps and then there's also you know more intrinsically human jobs like
*  government or being a scientist or being an artist and you're trying to make the
*  case that even in those we can imagine robots doing what human beings currently
*  do. Yeah so I mean there's a roboticist called Hans Moravec who formulated this
*  thing called Moravec's paradox back in the 1980s where he talked about how
*  actually you know high-level cognitive jobs are oftentimes the easiest things
*  to automate because they tend to be very easy to formulate an algorithm to
*  perform those tasks whereas physical manual labor is often the most difficult
*  thing to automate because it relies on kind of unpredictable or less easily
*  controlled stochastic variables and I don't know if his framing of it is
*  correct I think what most people would say nowadays is that their routine work
*  is easily automatable and anything that's non routine is a little bit more
*  difficult to automate although the new kinds of AI that we are developing seem
*  to be getting better at performing even these non routine tasks the things that
*  we thought traditionally were were hard to automate so yeah that's just one
*  point on like what kinds of jobs we can expect to see to see automated it seems
*  to be that probably more and more jobs we can expect to see automated based on
*  current technological trends and that's true even if there are limits to the
*  current systems of AI that we currently deploy because I think there's a lot of
*  room for different uses of the technology that we currently have that
*  haven't been tried out yet I think I've kind of I do lost the
*  throne of your original question though so well you know I think I'm just trying
*  to you know raise this idea that I'm sure is in many people's minds that sure
*  I can imagine you know financial trading or building cars being replaced by
*  robots but I can't imagine being a pop star or being a law professor being
*  replaced by robots right right so it's certainly intuitively plausible to me
*  that our artistic jobs or entertainment industry jobs are probably not going to
*  be subject to kind of wide-scale automation and there are people who are
*  building you know holographic pop stars in Asian countries that I think I've
*  seen several examples of this and there are people who are building or creating
*  algorithms that can make the next Beatles album a famous example from a
*  few years ago but I doubt that I hadn't skeptical as to whether people will be
*  that interested in robot or computer-created art I think it's
*  interesting as a novelty initially but I think there is something in art that we
*  like the human origin and the human story behind it and that that was often
*  cancer more than just the end product and we see this anyway in you know
*  debates about art and forgery you know a perfect forgery is never as good as
*  the original artwork why is that I think and part of the reason is that we we
*  care about the origin of artworks more than we care about let's say the origin
*  of furnitures or laptops and you know broadly speaking some people do care
*  about the origin of those things but that tends to be a luxury good but the
*  idea of you know automating pop stars that shouldn't find provide much
*  reassurance for people the notion that that is a type of work that's going to
*  be relatively resilient to automation should be that reassuring because that's
*  never been a job for the masses of people these are always jobs reserved
*  for the elite few these are so-called superstar markets where a handful of
*  individuals tend to extract most of the value from those markets so yeah I don't
*  think we should be reassured by that notion there are other kinds of jobs
*  that we might expect to hold up or be more resilient to automation like care
*  work or any form of work where the human touch is deemed to be important but I'm
*  not entirely convinced that they will be that resilient to automation either
*  because oftentimes these are jobs that few humans really want to perform I mean
*  one of the debates that where this comes up most is in care of the elderly for
*  example a lot of people argue that we shouldn't use robots to automate the care
*  of the elderly and I think they have good ethical reasons for thinking that
*  we might want to do that but I think there is a significant pressure to do it
*  because a lot of people don't like performing that kind of dirty care work
*  so to speak and also and there's a demographic challenge here as well which
*  is we've got increasingly aging populations and we need to do something
*  and to to care for them so I mean one of the countries where you see the most
*  automation of care workers in in Japan and which is one of the oldest
*  populations in the world that's partly due to reasons of restricting immigration
*  into Japan but it's also I think partly because of that demographic challenge
*  that younger generations in Japan don't really want to perform this kind of work
*  or aren't able to perform this kind of work. Right yeah I remember Kate Darling
*  for example who I did have on a previous podcast developing robots to help
*  care for elderly people so that that does sound like the kind of thing where
*  you when you first say the words people are like oh no that could never be done
*  in automation but maybe it could once you just think about it a little bit
*  more there's probably a lot of examples of that. Yeah and I mean just to be clear
*  I'm not necessarily saying that robots are going to do a better job in those
*  industries there are some industries where robots clearly would do a better
*  job than humans because these are industries that pride themselves on you
*  know speed and precision so I think financial trading is another good
*  example of that but it's just that there's even if the robots are less good
*  than humans at performing them there mightn't be a huge supply of human
*  labor into those industries for other demographic or social reasons. Okay but
*  we're mostly here not to say that automation is taking over but you want
*  to argue I think the more novel part of your argument is and that's good right
*  your book is called automation and utopia and I think that you're you're
*  doing a good thing by sort of at least the labeling is a little bit extremist
*  you're much more measured in the actual text but you're saying like let's just
*  imagine a world where work becomes completely optional so so what do you
*  have against work what is your arguments that it would be better if we didn't
*  have to have jobs to earn a living? Yeah so I think this is oftentimes the key
*  question that what I call in the book the desirability question which is like
*  do we want to for humans to keep working and remain competitive with
*  machines or to find other jobs for them that complement machines and one of my
*  this is more radical view in the book is that we probably shouldn't want that and
*  there are several reasons for it and I explore them in a chapter I think I have
*  five different arguments for thinking that work is a bad thing and in fact
*  that it's something that's being made worse by technology in a lot of
*  instances so the argument is probably complex and so far as it breaks down into
*  five parts but you know very briefly the reasons why I think work is a bad thing
*  and we should encourage its automation is that work tends to undermine freedom
*  of choice it tends to exert this kind of dominating influence over our lives I
*  think technology is making work worse for a lot of people it's leading to the
*  the fissuring of the workplace a lot of more outsourcing a lot more short-term
*  contract work precarious work gig work seems to be an increasing phenomenon of
*  technologically brokered marketplaces like Uber and deliver or other companies
*  like this and also there's a significant amount of inequality in work nowadays
*  both in terms of income disparity which appears to have been growing since the
*  1980s and there's an interesting story you can tell there that that increase in
*  income disparity seems to have been correlated with a period of time where
*  you see increased automation in middle-income middle-scale jobs in
*  particularly in the US and so there's there's inequality in terms of income
*  but there's also I think another interesting form of inequality in work
*  which is inequality in terms of the quality or meaningfulness of the work
*  which is a phenomenon that is discussed by a guy called David Otter MIT based
*  economist does a lot of work on manufacturing and outsourcing but he
*  talks about this polarization effect on the the labor market as a result of
*  technology that people are pushed into either low-skill low-income work or high
*  skill high-income work and just for people listening to this economists
*  define low skill in a maybe a counterintuitive way in that it's just the
*  amount of years of education you need to enter a job it defines whether it's
*  higher low skill so there's lots of low skill work that is highly skilled right
*  it's not really measure of skill but the the sort of background prerequisites you
*  need to take up the job yeah exactly so people are pushed into these lower scale
*  forms of works which are often more arduous and more difficult tends to be
*  kind of complex physical manual work which is not always pleasant and has
*  lots of maybe health and long-term health repercussions for people involved
*  in it but most people go into that low skill bracket because there are
*  relatively fewer high skill high-income jobs and there's also higher barriers to
*  entry into those jobs so you see this this polarization effect in terms of the
*  quality of work the meaningfulness of the work that people perform another
*  reason for not favoring employment is that I think work is increasingly
*  colonizing our lives to use a strong term in that yeah because the labor
*  market is increasingly competitive and work is more precarious as a result of
*  technology so people spend a lot more time and attention on upskilling
*  themselves trying to make themselves employable worrying about employment so
*  even if we're not spending more time at work and there's some evidence to
*  suggest that the amount of hours that people spend per year working has gone
*  down we're spending a lot more time thinking about work and caring about
*  work I mean I have one anecdote in the book which I think is illustrative of
*  this actually comes from another author David Frayne who wrote an interesting
*  ethnography of workers in the UK a few years back and he describes a story
*  where he was interviewing a 12 year old boy in a local school because he was
*  doing some classes with the local school some extracurricular classes and he asked
*  this boy why he did the class and did he enjoy it and the boy said yeah it was
*  enjoyable but the main reason why he did it is that it would ultimately look good
*  on his CV which is like a very odd thing for I think a 12 year old to be caring
*  about which is like building up their CV and their employability now that's
*  that's anic data but that's I think for illustrative of a general trend and the
*  other final reason I have like for thinking that the automation of work is a
*  good thing is that when you look at some of the evidence on whether people enjoy
*  work that there's some evidence suggests that they tend to be quite
*  dissatisfied with work so the gallop they do these large surveys of the
*  global workforce every few years and one of the consistent findings from their
*  surveys over the past 15 years or so is that most people express dissatisfaction
*  with the work that they're doing they don't feel fully engaged by it and I
*  think partly that's driven by the highly competitive and precarious nature of the
*  workplace that people think they could be doing better or they're worried about
*  the security of their jobs so well maybe yeah I mean maybe it's worth
*  expanding a little bit on the point that you raised but I think it is worth
*  diving into about the gig economy and about the structure of work these days
*  where jobs seem to be a bit more ephemeral I'm not sure how much data
*  there is saying that's true but it's certainly the feeling we get and it I
*  could imagine that there is something structural about the modern age which
*  makes employment less secure and less long-term is that an accurate
*  assessment yeah like there's a there's an interesting book about this actually
*  by a guy called Andrew Vile called the fishered workplace where he explores why
*  this happened historically so really in the middle part of the 20th century
*  there was a trend towards very large corporate organizations which you know
*  the you had a company like let's say Ford Motorcars who employed lots of
*  people and lots of very diverse workers under the same corporate umbrella so you
*  know they would hire catering staff they'd hire accountant workers they'd
*  hire IT they'd hire security guards and groundskeepers so on all employed within
*  the same organization and since the 1970s there's been a shift away from
*  that notion of the big corporation that hires everybody to do all the tasks that
*  are relevant to the whatever products they're producing or whatever service
*  they're providing and instead what you find is that companies are focusing on
*  what they view as their core competency and then they're outsourcing a lot of
*  the other forms of work and to part-time contractors or other companies that
*  specialize in say the provision of accounting services or security staff and
*  so on and why has that happened well there are a couple reasons why that's
*  happened one is that it's actually tends to be a more attractive way of arranging
*  a corporation from the perspective of shareholders and consumers because it
*  tends to increase the returns to shareholders because you reduce the cost
*  that you pay oftentimes when you do this kind of fissuring and outsourcing and it
*  tends to also reduce costs to consumers it tends to be more productivity but
*  workers tend to get the worst deal in this this arrangement and also
*  technology has facilitated this in so far as one reason traditionally why you
*  wouldn't outsource workers is that you wouldn't be able to easily monitor them
*  and ensure that they were complying with corporate standards but the advances in
*  surveillance technology have enabled kind of greater consistency and
*  enforcement of corporate standards and one area where this is like really
*  transparent is in truck drivers and the amount of ongoing surveillance of truck
*  drivers which has been true for quite some time now and but this trend
*  towards increased surveillance is creeping in in other industries as well
*  and it certainly sounds reminiscent to in the academic context of a shift
*  towards adjunct professors right short-term contracts rather than tenured
*  professors who are going to be there for many decades yeah so that's another
*  illustration of this phenomenon of this drive towards precarious forms of
*  labor I mean I haven't really investigated in detail the reasons for
*  that in the in academia I think part of it probably has to do something like the
*  the research funding culture and people get bought out on research grants and
*  tend to employ part-time labor to cover their teaching allocation that's a trend
*  at least in the UK and Ireland and it's probably more attractive as well from a
*  managerial perspective that it allows you to efficiently deliver mass higher
*  education on a kind of tight budget or cut budget yeah but okay so this argument
*  seems to amount to not an intrinsic indictment of work but a change in how
*  work is organized in our society that sort of makes it less rewarding and
*  stable and psychologically helpful right I mean so and maybe this is a sign of
*  this shift this transition that we're in the middle of it from a everybody works
*  society into a people don't necessarily work society yeah so it could be what
*  we're observing now is kind of friction or teething problems as we transition
*  from one society to the other and I mean to underlie a point that you just made
*  and I think is a more than one is that my critique of work isn't that work is
*  intrinsically bad because if you go back to the definition that I offered earlier
*  work work isn't any particular activity it is rather a condition under which we
*  perform an activity and my argument is that the conditions under which we
*  perform work perform our jobs are tend to tend to be getting worse for the
*  majority of workers that's not to say that there aren't people who benefit
*  from the current system there clearly are but the majority seem to be losing
*  out on the current arrangement well we'd be remiss if we didn't at least bring up
*  the arguments that I'm sure some people are thinking that there is an intrinsic
*  value to work right that the work ethic is a good thing to have that people get
*  sense of identity or even meaningfulness from the jobs that they do and so
*  couldn't someone say the thing to do is not to give in to the elimination of
*  work but to reorganize the economy so that jobs are more secure and rewarding
*  yeah so there is a widespread discussion of this in the kind of philosophical
*  literature about work which is you know meaningful work is what we should care
*  about and work is oftentimes the important sense part of people's identity
*  and sense of meaning and purpose in life and I'm very sensitive to that concern
*  or I that's something I care about but if you take one example of this that I
*  discussed in the book there's a couple of philosophers who wrote an article
*  called the goods of work other than money and they identify four things that
*  people get out of work apart from an income they get a sense of mastery over
*  some skill set they get to form alliances and friendships with people in
*  the workplace so they have the sense of community they also get to contribute to
*  their societies in some way sometimes positive maybe sometimes not so positive
*  but it's oftentimes the main way in which people contribute to society is
*  through their work and also they get a sense of social recognition and status
*  which of course people care about a lot they want to be respected and recognized
*  by their peers and so if people didn't work they would lose these four things
*  so what are you gonna do about it?
*  And my response to that is that you could lose those four things that's definitely true
*  but the question I would have is whether work is the only way in which we can get a sense of
*  mastery contribute to our societies have a sense of community and gain recognition and I'm not
*  convinced that it is the only way that we can get those things I think there might be other fora
*  that we can look into for pursuing those non-income related goods of work
*  I mean it's a pretty dramatic shift right I mean I don't know how what we counted if
*  10,000 years ago when people were hunter-gatherers do we count that as work I mean it was doing a
*  kind of job but I what I want to say is that literally throughout all of history people have
*  worked and you're suggesting not the only one to suggest but that that's coming to an end and
*  there's gonna be some nostalgia for that period of human history right?
*  Oh I mean absolutely I mean the thing about hunter-gatherers there's a very interesting
*  paper written back in the 60s I think by Marshall Salins called the original leisure society
*  Yuval Noah Harari made a lot of this in one of his books I think the first one sapiens so
*  this is notion that actually hunter-gatherers were the original leisure society because they
*  spent very little time every day working I mean in terms of getting their food they spent a couple
*  of hours that doing that and then the rest of their day was quite quite leisurely and they
*  seemed to derive a lot of kind of meaning and satisfaction for that well one thing I would say
*  is that the the level of attachment and nostalgia you have for work is probably a function of the
*  kind of work that you currently do so people like you and I who are in kind of these high-skilled
*  jobs where you know we're rewarded for complex creative problem solving and we also complain
*  but we have it pretty good yeah I mean there's things we can complain about but we have it
*  pretty good and we also have a lot of autonomy over what we do which a lot of work we don't have
*  we are probably the people who are most attached to the current system and most worried about
*  losing out of that because our work is such a core part of our identity and this is actually one
*  thing I mentioned in the book is that for me the notion that I would lose my job would that would
*  be significant I think I would I would definitely feel that as a loss because my work is so intrinsic
*  to my sense of who I am but I think I have to be sensitive to the fact that I am in a relatively
*  privileged position and not everyone feels the same way and lots and lots of people nowadays
*  get most of their satisfaction and sense of purpose and meaning from non-work related activities from
*  their families from community work from their hobbies and other interests well good and that
*  leads us into you know I think the the big payoff here you you you imagine a couple of different
*  scenarios for how we could cope with this transition into a world where work was not
*  taken for granted is something everyone has to do and and then you argue that this could be a good
*  thing so I won't put the words into your mouth I'll tell us how we could make a transition and why
*  it might be good yeah I mean this is a way that I set this up in the book and there's also a part
*  of this discussion which I've left out so far which is that I have a long discussion of all the
*  negative things that technology does to our lives as well and the ways in which it can
*  compromise our our freedom and our autonomy and our attention and all that even in a non-work
*  domain but setting that to the side actually you know that I think that's fair and maybe it's my
*  fault for not bringing that up but let's let's give a couple minutes to say that because I think
*  it is a point worth making I mean what is your argument about the the downsides of technology
*  because there are techno utopians techno pessimists and there's probably good arguments on both sides
*  but it's worth having them in the back of our brains as we contemplate this transition right
*  so I mean this notion that we you know we're going to abandon work and what are we going to do as a
*  result well there are kind of satirical dystopian versions of what that might entail that don't
*  look very very pleasant so I'm one of them that I discussed in the book is from the Pixar movie
*  Wally which is one model of what a future in which automated technology has become wide-thread
*  is like and it doesn't look to be a very pleasant one so for people who aren't familiar with the
*  movie it depicts a future in which the earth has been completely despoiled by technology and it's
*  you know pollution is rampant and the world is covered in trash and humans have migrated onto
*  these off-planet ships they're trying to find a new home humans have become incredibly obese they
*  ride around with these motorized chairs all day they get fed a constant stream of light entertainment
*  and fast food and all around them on these interstellar ships that they're traveling on
*  are these robots that really do all the work and that doesn't look like a very pleasant future
*  because it seems to reduce humans to this kind of passive state where we enjoy some of the benefits
*  that technology brings our lives the conveniences of technology but we don't really do anything so
*  we're not the agents that are controlling our future in any meaningful sense and because at
*  least in the modern era and liberal western societies we tend to really pride and value
*  our sense of agency and autonomy this looks like a serious threat that automating technologies
*  could pose to us that they could cut us out of the picture and reduce us to essentially servants of
*  the machine so to speak yeah i think that i think that is something to worry about um but we have
*  some choice in how we're going to shape it so uh how do we avoid that yeah so this is how i set it
*  up in the book is that if you imagine that as a negative future that we want to avoid well there's
*  kind of two things we can do or two ways of responding to it and a way of thinking about
*  the challenge that technology poses to us which is that increasingly technology seems to be
*  pushing humans out of the cognitive niche is a concept from evolutionary psychology and
*  evolutionary anthropology that i borrow as a metaphor for discussing this in the book
*  so humans have evolved that we've become successful because of our cognitive powers and our capacity
*  for complex problem solving but increasingly we are ceding that territory to machines so what do
*  we do in response well there's really two things we can do we can race against or say yeah uh fight
*  back against the machines in a sense by trying to become more like them more like the machines that
*  are replacing us and try to compete with them basically right i call this the cyborg solution
*  to our problem or the pursuit of the cyborg utopia that's the way i put it in the book
*  or we can cede the territory to machines and retreat to something else and i call this the
*  pursuing the virtual utopia or virtual life and i try to investigate the benefits and costs of both
*  of those solutions to the problem and i think there's merit to both of them but ultimately i
*  try to make the case for thinking that pursuing the virtual life is more appealing than it might
*  initially sound to be okay but let's let's so let's dig into the one you don't like as much
*  first the cyborg ization um how literal are we taking this are you are you imagining literally
*  like that i'm going to look like the borg where i you know have metal pieces hanging on to me or
*  is it a slightly more metaphorical version of a cyborg you have in mind so i think you can take
*  both perspectives on it right and i i suppose really there's a sliding scale of cyborg like
*  futures for us there is the future in which we really just become very closely integrated
*  with machines maybe we replace the majority of our biological components with machine-like
*  equivalents something like the the borg from from star trek or the the other view way of looking at
*  it which is actually a view that is favored in some philosophical circles which is that
*  humans have always been a technological species we've always had these very close almost symbiotic
*  relationships with the technology that we create so we've always been cyborgs in a sense
*  and we're becoming more cyborg like because we're becoming more dependent on technology but that
*  technology is still external to us it's not integrated into our our biology so i think
*  there's those kind of two ways of understanding it either you directly integrate the technology
*  into our biological systems possibly even replacing them or you just have these very close
*  dependency or interdependency relationships with technological artifacts that remain external to
*  your body so i mean in particular i know that certain companies are pursuing some kind of
*  brain computer interfaces or even neural implants that will sort of hook us into the internet or to
*  computers directly is that a step along the way towards cyber organization yeah i think so elon
*  musk is probably the example you're thinking of the neural link company is one of the ones that
*  attracted a lot of media attention anyway but i mean brain computer interfaces are widespread
*  and have been for quite some time and they're used for therapeutic reasons
*  brain implants are used for therapeutic reasons and they're also there's a large community of
*  cyborg hackers who people who in their own basements or kitchen laboratories try to
*  implant or if id chips into their arms or other maybe certainly more complex forms of brain
*  computer interface and so yeah i mean those are those are some of the possibilities one of the
*  people i cite in the book or as an illustration of an actual living cyborg is an artist called
*  neil harbison who i think is based in spain but he's from northern ireland originally and he
*  wears this device that's implanted into the back of his skull that
*  allows him to hear colors essentially because he's he's born colorblind and he has this device that
*  converts light waves into sound waves yeah and so he's just kind of like did or technologically
*  created synesthesia if you like and he's using technology to augment or explore different sensory
*  forms of engagement with the world so that's a more experimental use he defines himself as a
*  a cyborg and some interesting interviews with him where he says that he doesn't think that he
*  uses technology in his life he thinks that he is a bit of technology he i think he's founded
*  something called the trans species society for people who have a non-human identity basically
*  so there are people out there who are very actively pursuing this kind of highly technologized form of
*  cyborg existence and how exactly does this save us from work or from leaving work i mean
*  i'm missing a little connection there yeah so it doesn't necessarily save us from from needing work
*  so what it does is that if if we if we are losing competence and power to machines if
*  if the kind of wall-e dystopia is a realistic one the concern is that we won't be good at doing
*  anything anymore and we'll need machines to do everything for us becoming cyborg-like is possibly
*  a way of augmenting or enhancing our capacity so that we don't lose that to machines but i mean
*  you you've perhaps hinted at one of the big risks of doing this which i discussed in the book is that
*  that would probably be seem to be a way of perpetuating the economy in its current form
*  in the sense that well if humans are augmented they become efficient at performing tasks and
*  people want to employ them again and in fact i would have some fears about this that this might
*  like double down on many of the worst aspects of the labor market as we we currently see them the
*  aspects that i mentioned earlier on in this discussion so for example i complained about
*  the highly competitive nature of the labor market nowadays one of the ways in which that
*  competition manifests itself today is in education competition for upskilling in the future if we
*  pursue this kind of cyborg path it might manifest itself in the way of competition for cyborg
*  implants and that might also lead to increasing inequality and disparity in the workplace if
*  these cyborg implants are things that are only affordable by the elite few i mean even harry
*  potter he had a much better broom than everybody else and that did help him in the quidditch matches
*  so the technological competition is something that is very hard to escape exactly yeah yeah and i
*  mean i think there are other risks associated with trying to pursue the cyborg path one
*  one person has put this i think rather well and this is a this is a complex problem so
*  i'm going to treat it rather glibly here but sure there's an irish journalist called mark o'connell
*  they wrote this interesting book where he followed a lot of transhumanists or people who are interested
*  in cyborg identities and that and he pointed out there was an odd paradox or tension in their
*  views which is that a lot of them are very concerned about how inefficient human biology
*  is and how poorly designed our biological machinery is and they have this sense that we are
*  constrained and lack freedom as a result of the constraints of biology
*  and they want to replace that with technology and want to speak to become more technological like
*  people like ray kurtzfeil that want to create digital copies or uploads of the human mind
*  and he argues that this seems odd insofar as you're replacing the biological prison potentially
*  with a technological prison so you're substituting one kind of unfreedom for another kind of
*  unfreedom because you know who controls the technological infrastructure that you
*  replace yourself with at the moment it seems unlikely that it's going to be individuals it's
*  probably more likely going to be corporations or people who have this specialist know-how to create
*  these kinds of technologies so you might end up enslaving yourself to technology and becoming
*  less free as a result of of cyber organization so i think that's another serious concern with this
*  solution to our predicament or problem yeah i mean i think it makes sense i'm not sure if it's true
*  i'm not sure if it's true or not because i don't understand i don't trust my ability to predict
*  the future but i think it's a sensible argument you're making that sure we can try to out-compete
*  the robots by joining them but then we're still stuck in this cycle of being beholden to
*  larger power and economic structures that don't always have our good fortunes in in mind and
*  especially if they've now figured out how to make human beings more
*  replaceable less permanently employed etc you know that that could that would only get worse
*  if we were cyborgs i would i would imagine yeah i mean i think you make an important point which
*  is something i is worth emphasizing which is that you know i don't engage in a prediction game here
*  i wouldn't be confident of predicting the future in any sense i think is that is that like a woody
*  allen quote about predicting the future is hard or prediction is hard particularly when it's about
*  the future something like that i believe it's neil's bore believe it or not okay sorry i was
*  wrong i only say that because i thought it was yogi bear and i was i was wrong i think yeah i
*  think i'm getting confused in that there's there's a similar woody allen quote but anyway the less
*  we mention him the better that's fine so i'm really kind of trying to sketch different
*  scenarios in in the book and trying to evaluate them using kind of philosophical methods and
*  i i hope that the logic and structure of the arguments that i lay out is is clear so that
*  people can easily critique it if they think it's wrong or if that some of the assumptions underlying
*  it are wrong and part of what i wanted to do in the book was to illustrate a way of thinking
*  about the future that isn't kind of cheerleading for a particular future or saying that we're all
*  going to doom and gloom it is trying to be fair to different possibilities even though i take
*  stances on some issues um yeah my my confidence level in some of the claims i make wouldn't be
*  particularly high well yeah predicting is hard but i think you do you do um my impression is you
*  are arguing and i'm sort of sympathetic to it that the more dramatic transition to the future
*  is actually potentially a better one one in which we don't try to outcompete with the robots but we
*  say you know what robots good take over all of our work we're going to start doing something else
*  uh and we talk about this as sort of a virtual reality version of the future where games and
*  creativity play an important role so why don't you sketch out what that might entail yeah this is
*  in many ways the trickiest part of the book and it's probably the part of the book that i've had
*  the most trouble explaining to people afterwards so my my simple answer to your question is that
*  you probably need to read the 60 pages in the book that are dedicated to it to understand what i'm
*  saying but i'll try my best to summarize so what i say in the book is that there's a stereotypical
*  view of what a virtual reality future might look like and there is another more counterintuitive
*  view and i favor the counterintuitive view and i think it could be a good thing so the stereotypical
*  view is that a virtual future is one in which we all plug into the matrix or plug into some
*  computer generated virtual environment so yeah for those of you familiar with it one of the examples
*  i use in the book is neil stevenson's novel snow crash where he talks about the metaverse is
*  something that people spend a lot of time living and experimenting in and you know i think that's
*  that could be understood as a vision of a virtual future but there are some tensions within that in
*  so far as a lot of the things that take place in computer generated environments are in my mind
*  quite real and that you know you have real friendships and real conversations with people
*  and sometimes you can really harm or hurt people in virtual interactions so i might talk about this
*  phenomenon as well of virtual assault assaults committed via a computer avatar virtual environment
*  and so you know it's not clear to me that that's really a virtual world
*  entirely in a philosophically strict sense of what virtual would mean so the other alternative view
*  the counterintuitive view is that in a sense humans have always been a virtual species and this is
*  kind of the counterpoint to this notion that we've always been cyborgs we've also always kind of
*  been virtual in the sense that we have always used technology to create insulated environments
*  or niches in which we can survive that are hidden or shielded from a lot of real world effects
*  right and you know i'm not talking to you right now in the real natural world so to speak i'm
*  no i'm inside a nicely centrally heated home and i mean we manifestly are talking to each other
*  in the real world mediated by this wonderful electronic piece of technology so i think that's
*  exactly to your point that there's maybe not a hard fast line between real real and virtual real
*  exactly so so the counterintuitive view is really that we we've have been using technology to kind of
*  create environments that are more and more conforming to our desires and needs
*  and are less constrained by some of the the limits of the the physical or natural world
*  and we can continue to pursue this trend in such a way that we we have ever more control over the
*  kinds of environments in which we interact and that's the kind of vision of the virtual future
*  that i care about i mean there's there's a related point here which is that some people argue that
*  a lot of current existence is a kind of virtual reality game some people like david graber who's
*  an anthropologist or he's a lot of work is a virtual reality a lot of bullshit jobs to use
*  his phrase i don't know if this is a censored podcast so i apologize we're allowed to say that
*  go ahead yeah and and then there's people like uval noah harari who's written a few books about
*  this where he talks about religion as being a virtual reality game it's probably a claim
*  that's going to offend a lot of religious believers and also like consumer capitalism as being like a
*  virtual reality game that there's nothing we don't have to live life the way we're currently living
*  it it's kind of a socially constructed fact and it might be a socially constructed fact that not
*  a lot of us have control over but the more control we get over it the more virtual it starts to seem
*  to us and that's kind of the yeah i think i understand that perspective but it seems to be
*  stretching the meaning of the word virtual uh beyond what is really useful it's these are all
*  more examples of the social construction of reality right and the point being made is that
*  i mean so not even reality being socially constructed but the human rules and regulations
*  that we invent are clearly invented and we invent a whole bunch of different ones depending on the
*  contexts and we can continue to invent them with or without electronic aids and so this is a sense
*  of the word virtual reality in which we're being a little bit more self-conscious about the
*  construction of our ways of living yeah i mean so you've kind of actually summarized the point
*  better than i've i've ever been able to summarize it myself so i i agree that this is kind of a
*  stretch from how how people typically understand virtual reality and that's why i talked about the
*  stereotypical view initially but i actually think that this counter-intuitive understanding of it
*  is more appropriate and again i have a long-ish discussion of the philosophical reasons for
*  thinking that in in the book but yeah the more self-conscious we are about the arbitrary rules
*  and regulations we use to construct our engagement with the world the more of a virtual life we're
*  living and the kind of apotheosis of this trend is where we start to realize that everything we're
*  doing is essentially a game and we have control over the rules of that game yeah when reading
*  your book you know the the word game also struck me a little bit there is there's sort of both
*  narrow and broad definitions of that you know i've talked on the podcast about the idea of games and
*  how important they are but people really these days i think some people are going to think of
*  playing fortnight or you know something on your computer where it's a video shoot them up kind
*  of game or some sort of matching game on your smartphone whereas there's this broader notion
*  of sort of a structured activity with a goal right where we clearly make up the rules but you know
*  baseball is a game and knitting is a game and chess is a game and in some sense the financial markets
*  or universities or novel writing is a different form of game yeah so i think that's right and i
*  think people will probably run towards this maybe computer game scenario or understanding of it but
*  i do adopt this broader definition of a structured activity with a goal and i'm also crucially
*  one that is dictated or guided by arbitrary rules and this is a definition of games that actually
*  comes from a book by bernard suits a philosopher who wrote an interesting quirky book in the 1970s
*  called the grass opera it's a dialogue you know play-doh style dialogue where they talk about the
*  definition of a game and the notion of utopia and so i draw heavily on that in the book when i discuss
*  this idea but i think so i do think technology plays an important role in how game-like our
*  existence can be in one sense which is that technology gives us more opportunities to construct
*  more kinds of of games so and gives us more control over the arbitrary rules we use to
*  structure our lives now i mean to go back to the point that you know the financial market is a game
*  in a sense that's that's true and that's that's something that i am conscious of and work in the
*  modern world could be viewed as a game but what i think is is different about the modern world and
*  the future that i'm sketching is that at the moment work is largely a necessity for people
*  it's something that they have to do they don't have a choice so the future i'm imagining this
*  virtual future is one in which you actually do have a choice over the kinds of game that you get to
*  play good and that by that construction that sounds like um something good i just want to sort
*  of push a little bit on the word arbitrary that you've used to describe the rules of the game i
*  would not call rules of any game arbitrary like the rules of basketball are not arbitrary we made
*  them up but we made them up with a goal in mind like there are changes to the rules which would
*  clearly make the game worse and there are changes that would make it better so it's not like they
*  were random which i think is a sense that people get from using the word arbitrary yeah i know
*  that that's a fair point so um i guess they are they're contingent in some sense or they're on
*  they're unconstrained in some sense by so well i mean that that might be entirely right either
*  but so they are an exercise of choice and there are better and worse games and more interesting
*  games and a large part of that is the function of the kinds of rules that we choose to structure
*  our activities okay good so but that's i think uh we're talking about details too much and not
*  fleshing out the big picture here i mean you have uh your tell us more about what it would mean to
*  replace our current system of you have to work to earn a salary and earn a living with a world
*  where there were games in some very broad sense of the of the term that you could choose to be
*  involved in and that was where you found your sort of daily activity and meaning rather than
*  in your income earning uh role in life right so i mean one part of this conversation which we
*  haven't really touched upon and part of the reason of that is that i don't really touch upon in the
*  book which is that everything i'm saying is contingent upon the notion that people aren't
*  suffering tremendous hardship as a result of unemployment and from from losing an income and
*  so i set that issue to the side in the book and there are interesting debates and proposals around
*  things like the basic income guarantee as a way of solving the the loss of income that people have
*  as a result of jobs i'm looking more at this notion of the loss of meaning associated with
*  jobs and how we could find meaning in another forum so but sorry so we are assuming that there
*  is either basic income or some version of that where everyone has enough money to survive and
*  get through the day yeah i mean i'm probably even more abstract in general than that in so far as i
*  would say that we have to have some way of solving the potential deprivation that people would have
*  as a result of losing their jobs the loss of material wealth let's say right you could resolve
*  that through an income that people have to purchase services but there are other ways in which you
*  could address the loss of material wealth as well which wouldn't necessarily mean that we all get an
*  income got it so that there are different proposals out there for that but yeah yeah i'm i'm setting
*  that to the side and i'm assuming that and then i'm looking at the kind of meaning what do we do
*  with our time then right yeah this is the obvious question like let's imagine that we had no material
*  once and that i think just to let the audience know probably you and i both agree that that is
*  a highly non-trivial question that should be discussed but it's just not the question we're
*  interested in right here we're saying if that were solved what would we do right exactly yeah
*  and this is i'm this is a thought experiment in a sense it's a a long elaborate thought experiment
*  about if something was the case what would follow and this is something that i've got a lot of
*  pushback on since i've written the book which said i didn't discuss you know climate change and other
*  disasters that are facing humanity and you know part of my response to that is that no book can
*  be about everything that's i just wanted to set some issues aside to explore this kind of space
*  of thinking so so the the future that i'm envisioning is one in which we end up really
*  having a choice over the kinds of activity that we pursue in life and i view these as games because
*  we get to kind of choose the the rules that apply to our lives would that be a good thing is one
*  way of thinking about it and would it address the the non-income related goods that we might lose
*  through work so as i mentioned earlier the sense of mastery social contribution community building
*  social recognition can we find those things in games and i think we can you know you can get
*  a sense of mastery over games a sense of skill over game over the rules of a game and competency
*  in the performance of a game you can contribute to society through games and so far as you can kind
*  of add to the the pleasure and meaning in other people's lives by playing games with them you can
*  make their lives better by participating in these these activities you can also gain a sense of
*  social recognition through games in fact it's one of the main ways in which people currently gain
*  self-esteem or self-recognition is through pursuit of of game-like activities and being rewarded for
*  their competency in games how many likes you get on instagram right that's a version of a game
*  yeah although i mean that that might be a negative version of the game in one sense of right and and
*  this is one thing is all that i would be sensitive to and discuss maybe a little bit briefly in the
*  book is that it's not like a game a future in which we all play games would be perfect
*  um you know there'd still be the role for competition and there there are forms of
*  scarcity in the world of games that may correspond to the forms of scarcity we see in in the current
*  world in terms of material scarcity or income related scarcity in that um you know people care
*  about being the best at a game that's a kind of scarcity being the top ranked performer so there
*  are potential negatives and downsides to to playing games but one thing i like about this vision of
*  the future is that i think it can be a recipe for um kind of mass satisfaction and appeal
*  and it's not something that is limited to an elite few people to make a live a meaningful life
*  of games or things that can be pursued by by everybody it also enables what i think is an open
*  and dynamic future insofar as that there is a essentially an infinite horizon of games that
*  we could possibly explore and i think this is something that's important about thinking
*  positively about the future is that the future should as much as possible be an open horizon
*  and not kind of stagnant and closed down in some sense and oftentimes it's when we have a sense
*  that the future is closed and that society is stagnant that the most pessimism and
*  dystopianism tends to creep in well yeah i mean i think that it's it's an attractive picture in
*  some ways but you know questions do arise that i have that i'm going to give you a chance to
*  take a swat at them and the one you just uh meant the issue you just mentioned is one of them you
*  say that there's an infinite horizon of possibilities but the flip side of that is or at least the
*  counter argument is what if there's not what if we just get bored what if we sort of uh it turns
*  out that our creativity for inventing new ways to keep ourselves amused or or engaged or active
*  isn't as infinite as we hoped it was is that uh something to worry about or something to make
*  our peace with so i mean there's there's two things to say here one is that
*  even if the landscape of games isn't infinite there are there's often a kind of a relatively
*  limitless possibility space within individual games you know uh people have been playing chess
*  for thousands of years and a lot of people still find it intrinsically fascinating that there's
*  lots of room left to explore in it even though machines are better than humans at it so a human
*  performance chess is still a popular sport yeah so yeah within the game there's a lot of
*  sport yeah so yeah within an individual game there's often room for exploring lots of
*  different spaces within that game um so that's that's what point the other point is that
*  would would we get bored and would we kind of run out of things i think of at a limit of course we
*  would right i mean if we if we lived forever literally if our lives were infinite yeah we'd
*  end up doing everything and we might become complacent and bored i just think it's it seems
*  to me at the moment a good bet to suggest that there's lots of possibilities left to explore
*  lots of of new game spaces to explore and so far as we see lots of new games continually being
*  invented they might gain kind of mass traction or appeal right now but if they become the main focus
*  of our lives then we have the opportunity to to explore them i think that's fair so it's it's
*  just a bet i would have that we're unlikely to run out of things in any kind of meaningful human
*  time horizon at the limit we probably would okay maybe a more realistic worry is the following um
*  we talked about the social construction of the rules maybe they're not arbitrary but at least
*  we did make them up and i think that when it comes to more conventional notions of work where you're
*  building something and at the end of the day there's a chair or an automobile that was created by the
*  labor of yourself and others even if the rules of that that social role were made up by somebody
*  they they don't feel like they're made up by somebody they feel natural or they feel necessary
*  or they feel sort of uh imposed by the constraints of just living is there some worry that things
*  begin to seem less meaningful to us if the rules are obviously socially constructed like if we're
*  just making up rules of games in order for us to play them does that make us less fulfilled
*  somehow and i can sort of guess the answer but i'm asking the question in a leading way
*  yeah this is kind of a wider debate in kind of the philosophy on on the meaning of life which is
*  like do you need some kind of external narrative or structure in which your life is situated in
*  order for it to have meaning or do we embrace the more radical existentialist view which is that we
*  get to choose what the meaning is and i i tend to favor the latter view but i would qualify it in
*  one sense in that it is of course true that if we invent games we we might have an initially kind
*  of specified rule set that's clearly arbitrary but we discover things about the games that we play
*  that were unexpected or unanticipated given that initial rule set and we might find the need to
*  add new rules to the to the game so to speak so i mean to use one example you know the rules of
*  a football or soccer to an american audience you know it didn't include things about players not
*  being allowed to pass the ball directly back to the the goalkeeper at one point in time and the
*  goalkeeper being able to kick to pick up the ball they changed that rule because they thought it would
*  be more interesting things like the the offside rule these have been added to the game over time
*  because they realized that the initial set of rules wasn't sufficiently kind of interesting and
*  that there there are aspects of the game they didn't appreciate until they started to play it
*  more and so there are i think constraints within the world of games that we we don't initially
*  appreciate and yeah the the rule-bound nature of games isn't fully transparent to us well and i
*  think i mean another uh answer you could have given is everyone knows that we made up the rules
*  of football and this does not stop people from being really really passionately interested in
*  it right as a as a matter of empirical fact yeah i mean so that that's that's another point which
*  is that often oftentimes things that are clearly arbitrary as a matter of sociological fact and
*  anthropological fact do take on an outsized importance in society and actually become the
*  most important thing in in a in a society yeah um which is kind of an odd feature but yeah the
*  fact that they are contingent and socially constructed doesn't seem to have stopped anyone
*  to date from finding a lot of meaning within them okay so maybe my most serious uh question here is
*  you mentioned the fact when you're talking about work as it's presently constructed that
*  there are these power structures you know there's corporations and wealthy individuals and there's
*  inequality that can be exacerbated by the current economic setup do we have any reason to think
*  won't be just as bad in the virtual utopia i mean uh isn't there at least as much room for
*  power to be concentrated in certain hands and abused right along with it so i i definitely
*  think there is room for there to be power uh you know power inequalities and dynamics and
*  things that need to be addressed um so the again the point i would make about that is that the
*  virtual utopia isn't going to be perfect in any sense the hope is just that it's going to be
*  better than what we currently have but do we have reasons for thinking it's going to be better than
*  we currently have i think there are some reasons for optimism in so far as if you cut out the
*  material necessity of work and so we don't like one of the reasons why the power dynamics within
*  the existing economy are so meaningful and salient to people is because people have to work to survive
*  and to live right if you cut out that kind of material necessity and if everyone gets provided
*  with a sufficient amount to have a reasonable quality of life they have more freedom than to
*  choose the kinds of activities that they pursue the hope is that um the the power dynamics that
*  might exist will become less meaningful and salient to them and this is also one area in
*  which technology can help which goes back to one of my earlier points is that technology is still
*  part of this virtual utopia and that technology gives people more options okay i mean i do think
*  that um i get the feeling from our conversation that a lot of these that it's harder than i might
*  have thought to separate out the question of finding meaning in constructed activities from
*  the question of how do you pay for it and where does the where do the material goods come from i
*  mean i i totally respect the intellectual move of trying to separate the question of universal
*  income or the equivalent thereof from the question of what are we going to do with our time
*  but i suspect that in reality there's a very strong feedback between the two of them and
*  they're going to go hand in hand yeah no i i think that's fair and i think that's right that
*  you're not going to unlock this utopian future that i'm imagining unless you solve the problems
*  of kind of material deprivation or have a world of relative abundance for the majority i'm sure
*  i'm going to get a bunch of comments on the podcast saying that you know we could have solved all
*  these if andrew yang had been elected president of the united states but we missed our chance on
*  that one but i don't know i'm are you in favor of universal basic income let me just ask that on
*  on as an as an aside i think i am but i think that we're not sort of close to being able to
*  implement it yet and it's going to be an incremental move toward it rather than a big leap
*  yeah like i i'm broadly speaking i'm a fan of the idea and one of the reasons i'm a fan of the idea
*  actually doesn't have anything to do with technology i think there are lots of interesting
*  ethical reasons to favor a basic income that aren't linked to automation which is just that
*  a basic income kind of allows for more opportunity and freedom of choice in life and that that tends
*  to be the main ground on which philosophers have defended the notion the automation narrative is
*  only really taken center stage in the debate around basic income in the past decade or so
*  but people have been arguing for it for a very long time for for other reasons and if people
*  are interested i have a a longish series on my blog about the philosophy of the basic income
*  where i explore the reasons to be in favor of okay i mean i think you've given us a lot to think
*  about let me close with a more provocative aspect of the whole question so we have jobs
*  in the current system we work we get income from that that's a big part of our self identity of who
*  we are but there's another big part which is relationships family love friendship things
*  like that is there a parallel argument about how those aspects of our lives could become virtual
*  whether it's love or family or friendship well i said two things about that one is that
*  the vision of the future that i'm sketching in this conversation in the book doesn't rule out
*  the idea that we'll have relationships and families and i say this several times in the book that all
*  those things would still be available to us that's that's one issue whether we can have
*  virtual relationships and virtual companionships well i think we can and i've written several
*  papers on this about you know whether we can have robot friends or robot lovers that have written
*  uh quite a bit about this over the years and i think we can under certain conditions
*  um i mean i can go to those if you want but that would probably be too much longer conversation
*  we'll link to your website don't worry i mean so i mean just very briefly i i define myself as
*  as a an ethical behaviorist when it comes to our interactions with virtual others or machine like
*  others and that if they look and act like humans or the same roughly as humans in all important
*  respects then we can have meaningful relationships with them so there is a possibility for
*  relationships with with machines yeah i mean i think that uh your attitude in the book and
*  towards these things is one i'm very much in favor of namely that it is very hard to predict what's
*  going to happen but it makes all the sense in the world to imagine all the scenarios we can imagine
*  because things are changing super duper rapidly and exactly because we can't predict it's good
*  not to be sanguine it's good to really you know try to flesh out ahead of time what the implications
*  of some of things these things could be and personally i'd be all in favor of uh disconnecting
*  the the need to earn a living from the way we choose to spend our time during the day
*  yeah and it i mean really it is about breaking that link that's what is going to be what's valuable
*  to us and the other thing i would say as well just on a final note is that this notion of sketching
*  lots of different scenarios and plans i mean that i would view that as being the main thing that i do
*  which is that i try to imagine different possible futures and evaluate them using different kind of
*  ethical norms and principles so that we get a sense of the the broadness of the axiological
*  landscape into which we are navigating you gotta define the word axiological i know what it means
*  but it's axiology is the study of values so the different kinds of values associated with these
*  futures right i find myself at the end of many of my podcast interviews saying oh well it's a brave
*  new world things are going to be changing a lot and i think this is definitely an example of that
*  so john daner thanks so much for your insights here this is a fun conversation yeah thanks a lot
*  it's great
