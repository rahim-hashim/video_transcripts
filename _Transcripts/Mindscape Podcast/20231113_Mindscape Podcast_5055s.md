There is an undeniable romance in the idea of traveling to, and even living in, outer space. In recent years, a pragmatic justification has become increasingly popular: the Earth is vulnerable to threats both natural and human-made, and it seems only prudent to spread life to other locations in case a disaster befalls our home planet. But how realistic is such a grand ambition? The wife-and-husband team of Kelly and Zack Weinersmith have tackled this question from a dizzying number of angles, from aeronautics and biology to law and psychology. The result is their new book, A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through? It provides an exceptionally clear-eyed view of the challenges and opportunities ahead.

Kelly Weinersmith received a Ph.D. in ecology from the University of California, Davis. She is currently an adjunct professor in the department of biosciences at Rice University. Zack Weinersmith received a B.S. in English from Pfizer College. He is the creator of the popular webcomic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, as well as the author and co-author of several books, including Bea Wolf, a retelling of Beowulf as a children's story, with illustrations by Boulet. Kelly and Zach are also co-authors of Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything.

# Mindscape 256 | Kelly & Zach Weinersmith on Building Cities on the Moon and Mars
**Mindscape Podcast:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJqr_cCi9tM)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Longtime listeners
*  will probably have figured out that one of the things I try to do here on Mindscape is to bring
*  the world's experts to talk about the topic that we're going to talk about in that episode. So in
*  other words, less of an emphasis on pundits or general purpose writers or dilettantes or other
*  podcasters, things like that. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm a podcaster, kind
*  of a dilettante myself, but when I get into a topic, I wanted to get into it with the people
*  who have really spent a lot of time becoming professionals researching this kind of thing.
*  Today's podcast is an exception to that, but it is the best possible exception. I have zero qualms
*  about this one. Very, very happy that it worked out. Kelly and Zach Wienersmith are a wife and
*  husband team. And Zach, of course, will be well known to many of you. He is a web comic artist
*  and writer. He's the artist for Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, SMBC, the very well-known web
*  comic right up there with XKCD in terms of nerd credibility on the web. So I'm happy to have had
*  both of those two artists now on the show. And Kelly is actually a PhD ecologist and adjunct
*  faculty at Rice University, but we are not going to be talking for the most part about either
*  ecology or cartooning. I should also mention, to be fair, that Zach and Kelly have written a
*  previous book that was a science book, and Zach is the author of other things like a kids book
*  version of Beowulf called Bay Wolf that I can recommend very, very highly. But the topic today
*  is space settlement, the idea of taking human beings, flying them to a space station or the
*  moon or Mars or wherever, and living there as a sustainable society for generations at a time.
*  Is this possible? How would it happen? What are the obstacles and so forth?
*  And what I love about Kelly and Zach is they just dive into it. They're super smart people who take
*  their job seriously. They want to explain things in a way that everybody can understand, but they
*  don't come in with an agenda. So they're rightfully proud of the ginormous number of footnotes in the
*  book that they have just came out called A City on Mars. Can we settle space? Should we settle
*  space? And have we really thought this through? They've done a lot of research and because they're
*  not in the field, they can give a somewhat balanced view of an area that often doesn't have enough
*  balance because the people who devote their lives to the exploration and settlement of space
*  are unsurprisingly kind of on one side. They think it's a great thing, right? And so Kelly and Zach
*  also think it would be a great thing, but they're very, very clear-eyed about what the challenges
*  are. And the challenges are quite large. So this is a fun podcast. It's super educational,
*  but I also think it's super fair. It gives a perspective on this that we really should keep
*  in mind because I think a lot of us, including myself, would like to see humankind extend itself
*  to other environments. But if we're going to do that successfully, we got to know what the challenges
*  really are. This is the podcast to come to if you want to know what those challenges are. So let's go.
*  Kelly and Zach Wienersmith, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks for having us.
*  So I'm going to ask you a question. This is probably like a little out of left field,
*  not the question you usually get or have ever gotten before, but have people had sex in space?
*  Is that possible to do? Would it be any fun?
*  We have different views.
*  Yes, we do.
*  We do. Well, so let us be clear that this is a probabilistic question. There is no certainty.
*  So the question is, what value do you assign to the likelihood that it just happened? I hit somewhere
*  like one to five percent chance that it's happened.
*  And I feel like, you know, if you've ever met a human, you know that humans are going to find a
*  way to have sex in space. And so there's no, people will tell you that like, oh yeah, we know for sure
*  it happened. And every time we searched for a story where it was like, oh, for sure happened,
*  we were not able to confirm that it for sure happened. But there has been a married couple
*  in space. And Zach points out that they were in the shuttle and it's tiny and probably you
*  wouldn't want to have sex with your colleagues and you're all very professional and your careers
*  are on the line. And I still don't think that would stop me. You know, maybe that would stop us.
*  It takes two people to-
*  That's right. You would be deterred.
*  But-
*  Listen, listen.
*  Go on.
*  My wife has a dirty mind. And listen, here's the thing. So she's using what I think of as
*  the stoichiometric approach, which is you take like tendency towards sex and you multiply it by
*  hours in space and you arrive at a probability, which is an incorrect approach because you have
*  to look at the actual facts. So consider that like up until the early eighties, it was all dudes in
*  space. And I understand that that doesn't, it depends on what definition of sex we want to use.
*  Sure.
*  But the homophobic society is not to make this too serious. So the odds that like careerists,
*  astronauts are going to risk it all for a little, you know, boy on boy action in the space shower
*  seems dicey. I would say also, you know, so I think one area where Kelly and I probably agree
*  is the most, if it happened, it was almost certainly in one of the late Russian space stations.
*  Would you agree with that?
*  Sure.
*  And the reason I think we would agree with that is one, they were less monitored. So now there's
*  like perpetual monitoring just because you can constantly send signal, whereas there would have
*  been gap back then. So one, there was a little, you know, it only takes about a minute and a half
*  to have a good time. Great time takes a lot of time.
*  Yeah. A great time is a minute 45.
*  There you go.
*  But no, so if it happened, you know, and so like the ISS, it would be very hard to get away with.
*  You basically have to have a conspiracy between international, where would you do it? She's
*  shaking her head at me.
*  I don't know. It could be in the rest. No, wait, they've got their little cubbies that they sleep
*  in. Sean, I told you we don't give short answers.
*  It's that one person.
*  I understand.
*  You're going to get like carbon narcosis as you exhale into the coffin sized cubby hole.
*  So anyway, so if we agree that it almost certainly had to happen on a Russian space station,
*  almost no women went to those stations.
*  That's not true. Shuttle Mir, there were plenty of shuttle people there. We disagree.
*  There's no way Shannon Lucid was the only long-term woman staying on Shuttle Mir.
*  You don't have to be long-term. You only have to be on there for a minute and a half.
*  Okay, but Shannon Lucid was like a librarian from Oklahoma in between being an astronaut.
*  I just don't, she was excited about the fellow.
*  I have another human nature data point that is relevant but is actually against Kelly's argument.
*  Oh, then I'm sure I want to hear it.
*  If I were part of the first set of people to ever have sex in space, once I had been retired from
*  being an astronaut, you think I wouldn't let people know about this? Like this is a historic thing.
*  That's right.
*  Someone's going to be first.
*  That is both a good point and a good insight into human behavior.
*  I hate to cite you with my own life on this, but I would say, for example, Lynne Sher is a biographer
*  of Sally Ride, very good friend of many of the women astronauts in the program going back to the
*  70s. She said she knew the first woman who menstruated in space who has, to my knowledge,
*  still not been identified.
*  That's a little bit less of a thing to be known for.
*  It is less thrilling, but it is like, astronauts keep secrets about certain things. I think there
*  can't use the standard anti-conspiracy theory argument that humans blab because this is a very
*  special set of humans who are extremely career oriented.
*  Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Well, I wanted to get that,
*  probably the only time you'll get to talk about this because it's not very interesting
*  to most people. But I think that most of what you're concerned about in your new book,
*  which we will note is called A City on Mars, Can We Settle Space? Should We Settle Space?
*  And have we really thought this through? Slightly Mr. Peanut Butter-esque title there.
*  And it is mostly about gravity, right? You're mostly thinking about literally being on a planet.
*  You're talking about settling things in space. We're not going to, for the rest of the hour,
*  talk mostly about zero-G flights. Is that right?
*  That's right. Yeah. The three places that we focus on the most are the moon,
*  Mars, and rotating space stations. And out of all of those, we think that Mars is probably
*  the most likely.
*  Well, the moon is the closest, I mean, at least until we build a big space station. So
*  how would it work? What is the scenario that we are contemplating here? We're talking about not
*  just flying human beings to Mars, but literally building a settlement and staying there, right?
*  What is the situation we're both imagining and then critiquing?
*  Yeah, sure, sure, sure. So you can get a little lost in the nomenclature. There have been attempts
*  to disambiguate what's an outpost and what's a settlement and stuff. So generally speaking,
*  we would say settlement is somewhere where people can have kids. And so you're probably
*  at least talking a few thousand people. The scenario I would add that a lot of space
*  expansionist advocate types are concerned with is in particular a settlement that has the
*  set of qualities that would allow for permanence in the sense of Earth could explode or just lose
*  contact and you could carry on. Self-sustained, yeah.
*  Self-sustaining, yeah, yeah, yeah. Permanently self-sustaining, which is like,
*  the thing about permanent self-sustaining is it's like you have to think in terms of generations,
*  right? So that's a whole can of worms, but it's a huge, huge thing to be permanently self-sustaining.
*  So I'd like to think we're critiquing it at several levels, but I think a better way to
*  think about it than in terms of population stuff is to think about the components that you need to
*  succeed at to pull this off. And so most basically you have to have a kind of survival bubble
*  that can provide all the consumables you need either locally or by shipping them at a great
*  expense. Outside of that, the next big thing is usually shielding because most places in space
*  are going to be assaulted by radiation. Earth has this nice thing called a magnetosphere. Mars
*  has very weak magnetism. The moon, I believe, has none at all. And so you're going to have to
*  provide against that. And then you get to more bio-social science stuff. You need to have a local
*  ecosystem. Unless you're willing to truck in enormous amounts of consumables, you have to be
*  able to grow plants because plants provide both oxygen and food. And you have to have medical
*  services and to be able to provide reproduction, which is a huge thing for us is that this is like
*  basically undeveloped science, human reproduction of world. There's more I could get into, but yeah.
*  We will. We will. But I guess what I wanted to get at was let's say that instead of writing a book
*  and telling the truth, you were working for NASA or for some equivalent agency or private corporation
*  and wanted to set out the roadmap for how it would work. What are the steps that are involved
*  in creating human settlement, let's say on Mars, although we'll talk about the other options?
*  Well, so I'd say first you want to understand how the human body responds to space before you
*  send people out there without a plan to bring them back. So one problem that we have is that
*  most of our data have come from places like the International Space Station, where you have a
*  station orbiting Earth in freefall. So we know that no gravity is bad for our bones and our
*  muscles and that fluid shifts and impacts vision. And we know that that's bad, especially over the
*  long term. But we actually don't know how bad it gets over the long term, because the longest stay
*  is like a year and a half. And the moon and Mars, the moon has one sixth Earth's gravity and the
*  Mars and Mars has about 40%. Maybe that's enough to get rid of all of the bone problems and the
*  muscle problems. But we just we don't know right now. We don't have a lot of data.
*  I'm sorry, but you are not doing a good job at being NASA and giving me the roadmap.
*  You're instantly jumping to the problems.
*  All right. So human health.
*  But no, literally how we get there, what is the plan? Like, do we do we build one rocket and go
*  first? Do we first go to orbit and build a space station to like, how many rockets do we need?
*  What is the set of steps that must be taken to make this happen?
*  Yeah. So there are a lot of different proposals. It might be interesting to think about the one
*  von Braun was proposing way back in the 50s that we deviated from in favor of the Apollo program.
*  And his proposal, which you hate to side with an ex-Nazi, but his proposal, which setting aside
*  cost is way more sensible than what we ended up doing, which was you build a very large space
*  station, which would consist of like 80 people. And the reason you do that is because now you
*  have a manufacturing facility close to Earth that can work in zero G. And that means that when it's
*  time to go to the moon, you can go in style. So you can for him, that means like sending geologists
*  and all this stuff. But it also means if you wanted to set up a substantial base on the moon,
*  which you absolutely want to do before Mars, then it would really help to have a manufacturing
*  system. There are debates about this. I mean, you know, in some world rockets get so cheap,
*  you just send the rocket straight to the moon, but let's just say it. And then what you would
*  want to do is really build out on the moon. And the reason you want to build out on the moon,
*  we argue, is that you just need, you know, it's almost less about science than like something
*  like an employee handbook. There's just a lot of stuff you don't know until you get there, right?
*  And so, you know, we need kind of best practices for converting this like dead horrible soil. I
*  mean, it's not the same as Mars, but it's at least in the realm of it, you know, converting that to
*  an ecosystem. And like, we really need to learn like, like a big track of this is learning how to
*  build an on-site ecosystem that can supply most of your consumables on an ongoing basis. Also,
*  that's an opportunity while we have our base on the moon to work out the problems in reproduction,
*  which is a long way off. You'd ideally want to like scale through this is this is what we're
*  doing running the settlement agency. You'd want to like do this ethically, which means starting
*  with simple animal systems and working your way up. And you could be comfortable with humans. And
*  at some point, you know, if this works out, I note it would be very expensive. There might be an
*  angle on tourism to fund some of it. At some point, you've mastered how to get humans to live in this
*  horrible place where everything outside of your protection bubble is doom. And hopefully, in the
*  meantime, you have developed massive rocket technology, because it's going to be much harder
*  to get to Mars. Mars is six months inbound, right? The moon is two days inbound. And so,
*  so there are going to be new things to do. But I think plausibly, once you've mastered how to live
*  like 1000 people on the moon for some period of time, like, like, if you have the equivalent of
*  our Antarctic base at the South Pole on the moon, you're probably ready to take a stab at Mars.
*  I think that would be our roadmap. The other big threat of that is that the legal aspects are a
*  little funky. But if you're just talking about research bases, even if they're quite substantial,
*  that's all on the up and up, as long as you're not claiming to own anything under the research
*  stations. Okay, but that's very, very useful. So you are telling me that my goal is not to build
*  some giant rockets and fire them at Mars, but rather to go by steps to maybe explain a little
*  bit more about why the space station is useful, as well as going to the moon. And then if I'm going
*  to go to the space station anyway, are we sure we need the moon? Isn't the space station even harder?
*  Could we have a thousand person space station as our trial run?
*  Yeah. So I think at least in the old fun Brown model, he was talking about like an 80 person
*  space station. And I think the basic idea is that, and this is, you know, I think people have been
*  talking about for a long time, it has yet to be proven. There are certain things that are easier
*  to do in zero G plausibly building a giganto spacecraft is there historically. We meaning
*  like everybody doing space has been opposed to rendezvous. And I talked to an aerospace guy and
*  he was basically like rendezvous really hard. And if you know the history of the Gemini program,
*  you know, a lot of problems came from trying to dock Gemini with the Gina, which was this like
*  rocket system for space. And so like, you know, part of the weird thing about Apollo is there is
*  no rendezvous, you just launch a skyscraper and little pieces of it break off until finally a
*  teeny weeny dingy goes to the moon. Right. That's no good for a settlement. So, you know, so you're
*  but in fairness to the like, you know, people who are excited about new developments, scaling
*  really would help a lot. You know, like getting getting a lot of Starships rolling Starship for
*  people who don't know is this rocket with about the capacity of the old Saturn fives. It's this
*  giant, incredibly ridiculously huge vehicle SpaceX is working on and more importantly, trying to make
*  reusable. So the price of launching stuff to space would be quite low. So for obvious reasons,
*  I think like that kind of scaling really makes a difference. Possibly even obviates the need for
*  any kind of space station because you can just you get so good at throwing mass out of Earth.
*  That's totally plausible. More spacey arguments that were popular in the 70s were maybe you build
*  a mass driver on the moon, eventually using all that capacity. So you can just like use
*  pure electricity to slam stuff into space. You know, that's getting a little more speculative
*  than we like to get. But maybe there's a little bit of a lesson, which is that gravity,
*  as annoying as it is, is actually helpful in some ways. In fact, maybe it's just not that easy to do
*  manufacturing of giant things like spacecraft in orbit, because things tend to float away.
*  And it's hard to match them up because you don't have a level and I don't know, but I could
*  imagine that it turns out to just be easier to go to the moon and build your Mars rocket there.
*  Yeah, no, totally possible and plausible. And Zach and I only researched the most important topics.
*  And so we can tell you that almost every single vehicle that has been in like zero G has had
*  problems with escape of waste and feces floating through the air. On the shuttle,
*  they were called brown trout. And you don't want your brown, you want your brown trout going
*  downstream into the toilets. And so yeah, gravity is nice for a lot of reasons and it helps with
*  waste as well. Yeah, and that's part of why one of the arguments for these big rotating space
*  stations, which we're fairly skeptical of, but one of the arguments is by going toward the center,
*  you can select your gravity regime. The argument is that'd be good for manufacturing. That seems
*  like a whole lot of work to get this benefit. So it hasn't been proven certainly. Okay, so in
*  our hypothetical roadmap, we're going to the moon first. We're making sure we can live there for a
*  while, working out some of the kinks, and then we'll eventually go to Mars. I mean, why not just
*  stay on the moon? Isn't the moon closer and nicer? What's so great about Mars? So the moon is closer
*  and nicer, but it lacks a lot of stuff you're going to need for a self-sustaining society. So
*  the water that it has, there's small quantities of it on the poles in these hard to get places,
*  whereas Mars has a lot more water just about everywhere. There's still more of it at the
*  poles, but almost anywhere you are, you can find water. Plus, we are carbon based life forms.
*  And the moon has very little carbon. In fact, I think most of it is in the fecal and vomit bags
*  that were left behind by the Apollo. Maybe not most of it. A fair bit of it. Concentrated sources.
*  So the moon doesn't have a lot of carbon. We're going to need that to make humans, to grow plants,
*  and so we're going to have to truck that in. But if you go to Mars, the atmosphere is made out of
*  carbon dioxide, and you can break that up. And there's just a lot of things that you can do
*  on Mars that would be hard to do on the moon. So in terms of self-sustaining life,
*  Mars has a lot going for it that the moon doesn't.
*  As far as our roadmap is concerned, are we going to want to eventually terraform Mars so that the
*  atmosphere is breathable, or is that just crazy talk? So I am an ecologist, and I would argue
*  that we maybe don't understand all of this stuff well enough to be throwing nuclear bombs at the
*  pole of Mars and hoping that you get just the right temperature and just the right thickness
*  of atmosphere. So we, to be honest in the book, don't get too much into terraforming. We're talking
*  about more of the early stage. How do you start a society? What's legal when you get there? What
*  kind of health problems would you have? But I don't know. I mean, it would be nice if Mars were
*  warmer, but I'm not sure we're going to be able to do that. And one thing I would add to that is,
*  and this never comes up in terraforming conversations, but is whatever plan you
*  want to use, whether you're hurling comets and asteroids at the Martian poles or you're
*  detonating 80 trillion fusion bombs, what geopolitical legal framework countenance is this?
*  Who's doing it? Right? Suppose tomorrow Vladimir Putin says, I want to throw, I mean, he can't,
*  but let's say he surprised us all and this whole time they've been building fusion-powered
*  space vehicles and he's like, we're about to hurl the comets. Don't worry, they won't hit Earth,
*  lots of clearance and they'll hit Mars on target and terraform it. And we're going to do that
*  because it's great. We don't even know how to think about that. That's obviously extraordinarily
*  dangerous. And in terms of international law, it's very ambiguous whether that's allowed.
*  I would say it seems to me like it probably is, but there are environmental concerns.
*  You'd have to contact another country with that. I'm concerned about your environmental impact.
*  So it is in some sense, it would be legal, but I think obviously terrifying and I don't know,
*  it seems to me like not a quibble. And it would totally take the space settlements,
*  no one in the next 20, 30 generations would be able to do it, especially if you hit it
*  with nuclear weapons. That's the other thing, by the way. So I would say if we're talking about
*  terraforming, then you're talking now on the millennium scale, not on...
*  Okay. And also we're not even that great at fine-tuning the temperature of the atmosphere
*  here on Earth. Amen.
*  So you did mention comets. So let me very briefly get that on the table. So there's an idea that we
*  can use comets as raw materials, right? Like comets have water and ice and volatiles and maybe
*  mining them or bringing them to our space settlements might be a very long-term future goal.
*  Sure. Yeah. The only thing I would say about that is you have to really care. We didn't put this in
*  the book, but we started calling it something like the elemental perspective, which is a very sort
*  of engineer, physicist way to look at how to survive, which is like, well, do you have enough
*  carbon and hydrogen? Therefore you can make life. You have to be really careful.
*  What else do you need?
*  What else do you need? Yeah. Well, you need some sulfur and phosphorus.
*  But yeah, so a really good example of this. And this is a great... But we're allowed to go
*  in depth on the show. Okay. So you will hear over and over, Harrison Schmidt, the only senator
*  slash geologist slash astronaut pushes this, the idea that we'll go to the moon and get helium free,
*  a rare isotope of helium that is indeed quite valuable. And the idea usually is that we will
*  use it in a fusion drive. And it's this especially cool fusion drive. I believe the usual reaction
*  is with deuterium and it's aneutronic. So you won't even have to fix the walls. They didn't
*  get radiated in your tokamak or whatever. So yay. The problem with this idea is that, one,
*  obviously we don't have the fusion device and it actually uses like an exotic reaction when we can't
*  even do the easier one yet, which seems to matter. I think the aeutronic business is overstated. I
*  kind of feel like if you've got fusion working with good old deuterium tritium, like the job
*  is done, go home. But I think more importantly, there's not that much. It's a higher concentration
*  than you find on earth. But in order to get a reasonable quantity, you're like strip mining a
*  huge amount of the surface of the moon, which like separate from how we feel about that,
*  like try to imagine building equipment to work in this no air, low gravity, two weeks night,
*  two weeks day, et cetera environment. Like the idea that you're going to make money doing this
*  is crazy. Michel van Pelt, who's a scientist at ESA, and this is five years ago, so maybe the
*  equation is slightly changed, but he said, and it's almost verbatim, I think, if there were bars of
*  gold sitting on the moon, it would not be worth it to go get them. Now, if you change the economics,
*  if you say, well, it's so valuable to have water on Mars, then the economics change. But I think
*  that tells you something about life on Mars, which is it's not pleasant. So I think the comments for
*  water thing is a cool sci-fi thing. I'm quite skeptical that that'd be a good way to... I mean,
*  the one thing I would add with all these conversations is space geeks, you get into
*  arguments with them and they're like, well, I'm talking about the next 10,000 years. You're like,
*  okay, I think the prediction horizon right now is like 50 years. So if you want to talk about
*  10,000 years, that's fine. But- Can't argue. Right.
*  Yeah. Right. So if I understand then the attraction to Mars versus the moon, it has more water,
*  it has more carbon dioxide, et cetera. But it's not that we're literally going to be farming on
*  the surface of Mars. It's just that we have the raw materials out there to mine or collect and
*  bring to our underground or enclosed settlements. Yeah. And it's still going to be awful. That soil
*  that you might want to plant your plants in, it's about 1% perchlorates, which is a chemical that
*  binds to the hormones made by your thyroid. And those hormones regulate things like blood pressure,
*  heart rate, stuff like that. So you're going to want to remove that because studies have shown
*  that it does get picked up by plants when you grow plants in them. And so first you're going to have
*  to pull the perchlorates out of the soil before you can even start your farm. And there's all
*  kinds of the dust storms, those are going to be miserable and they're going to make solar panels
*  difficult. Yes, it has more of what we need, but it's still going to suck. Right. That's fine. Okay,
*  good. Good. Well, at least now I know the motivation such as it is for continuing on beyond the moon
*  to Mars. But you mentioned if the goal is sustainability, that does include human beings
*  reproducing. So someone's going to have to sex in space at some point. I don't know when, but
*  and they're going to get births. Yeah, they're going to, they will talk about it. There might be
*  videos. I don't know, but then they will give birth and that's a whole nother can of worms,
*  as it were. What do we know about both giving birth or for that matter, being pregnant, but also
*  being a baby on the moon or on Mars? We know, can I do this? Yeah, please. We know almost nothing. So
*  we very rarely send up rodents with the goal of understanding sex or reproduction or development.
*  And when we do, they're sent up for a small window of the gestational period. So they're like shot
*  up at, you know, incredible G's, they're pushed back against their cages. They're up in space for
*  like a week floating around and then they fall back down to earth at incredible G's. And then
*  they look to see what happens. And maybe not surprisingly, a lot of stuff seems to go wrong,
*  right? That's probably very stressful. We've recently started making these like wheels
*  that spin and create artificial gravity that are on the International Space Station.
*  Little tiny ones for rodents. And we've started to train astronauts to euthanize the rats and
*  process them in space. So you don't get that final trip back down. That's very stressful.
*  But that's pretty much where we are. We haven't, we don't even have rodents that have like had sex,
*  had babies, those babies survived and they went on to have babies. None of that has happened in
*  space so far. And so we really don't understand one, how gravity impacts reproduction. So as we
*  mentioned, the International Space Station has effectively no gravity, whereas these other places
*  have some gravity. And maybe that's going to be enough, but maybe not. We don't really know.
*  And then also the International Space Station is protected by Earth's magnetosphere. So those
*  rodents are not exposed to space radiation that you'll get on the moon or on Mars. And maybe you
*  can shield with like a thick layer of regolith and protect everyone from that radiation. But we really
*  don't understand the impacts of that stuff yet and how well it's all going to work out.
*  So I would, we would say that there's huge question marks about whether or not this is going to go
*  well. And to us, that seems unethical. And usually this is something that the space community seems
*  to just sort of not deal with directly. But when they do deal with it directly, it's horrifying.
*  Like we found quotes of people saying like, look, life is going to be really hard on Mars initially,
*  and everybody's going to need to be pulling their weight. And so we might have to like encourage
*  people to get abortions if it looks like their kids are not going to be able to contribute.
*  But what does that mean for like things, disabilities that come on at three years,
*  three years of age or something? Are we going to be pushing toddlers out of airlocks? And it just,
*  anyway, this all gets very uncomfortable the more you think about it. So that's part of why we want
*  to see research stations on the moon. We'd like to at least know that it works okay at 1, 6G and
*  that we can do this without too many calamities when people can still get sent home in a couple
*  days as opposed to being stranded on Mars. And the space radiation point makes me,
*  I should have gone back to our roadmap and pointed out, I guess it won't be like glass domes on the
*  moon or Mars. We will literally be either building giant shelters with a lot of shielding or just
*  going underground. Yeah, I think that's right. So, you know, there is some world maybe in which
*  you have plants in a Martian glass dome, although understand you have almost no pressure outside
*  and at least some, you know, atmosphere inside. So already the problem is extraordinarily
*  difficult from a like materials perspective. But at least in principle, you could do that because,
*  you know, the plants might survive. Okay, you could let in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But
*  yeah, humans strolling around is going to be a problem. And it's a problem that actually has
*  weird consequences. So I don't remember if we get into this, but like, as an example,
*  one question is what happens to gametes in human bodies? You know, those are precious gametes,
*  if you want to have generations and women start life with their full gamete load, whereas men
*  produce their whole lives. And so like, would you have gender based rules for who has to stay
*  underground? That doesn't seem right. But, or age based. It's a harsh environment.
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So that's the thing. So you can always say like, well,
*  it's just going to be different because it's a settler lifestyle. But it's like,
*  we really want to create this horrible lifestyle. Right. And if you can anticipate ahead of time
*  that it's going to be horrible, then don't send people there. Well, and also, unless you literally
*  are worried about the earth coming to an end somehow, what is the benefit of building an
*  underground city on the moon or Mars rather than underground city on earth, which doesn't seem to
*  be very popular as a prospect? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So one example we'd like to go to is, you
*  know, it would be far easier to build a city on the bottom of the sea. Right. And so if you have
*  a self-sustaining bottom of the ocean city, it's really hard to imagine what could happen to earth
*  that would eliminate that city. You know, like we actually, as an intellectual exercise, you know,
*  ask yourself what you could do to earth to make it as bad as Mars, right. To just, you know, like,
*  the only thing I could come up with was you'd have to slam it with a lot of very large asteroids.
*  You'd basically have to like superheat the surface to get anything like Mars. Earth is good.
*  Earth is really good. But like, I do, I do still feel like it's a beautiful idea to have humans
*  on Mars. Like, I like the idea of it happening at some point, even if we're living underground
*  like ants, it still feels like it's awesome. It still seems awesome to me. But I just think
*  we should do it in a way that has, you know, fewer ethical, ethical issues. Well, and also
*  let's admit to the force of the argument for backing up the biosphere, right. You know,
*  maybe there would be a terrible thing that happens on earth and it is the only place we are now. I
*  absolutely see the impact of an argument that says if literally the existence of life is in danger,
*  we should go to great lengths to prevent that disaster from happening. Yeah, yeah, I would say
*  we basically agree with that over the long term. The two points of pushback on that are one
*  that like you have to say like, because that's essentially an argument to spend a bunch of money
*  whether or not there's an ROI on it, right. It's like an it's an ought argument. We ought to do this
*  outside of economics. So the problem is one, almost certainly a dollar is better spent on
*  something else for reducing catastrophic risk, at least in the next century. Yeah. So one, like if
*  you sort of list as Toby Ord does, like the set of calamities, a bunch you're going to be higher than
*  an annihilation of the species on earth that could be salvaged by a Mars base. The other pushback,
*  which is longer term, is the big question. If you're just talking about existential risk,
*  I do think it's a kind of open question whether settling Mars increases or decreases over the
*  long term existential risk because you, you know, we only talked about this briefly. It's about as
*  speculative as we want to get, but interplanetary warfare has like nightmare potential because like,
*  you know, one of the reasons, I mean, this is a whole debate, like why don't we use gas weapons
*  typically on each other? And there are like psychological reasons, of course, but one reason
*  is that gas doesn't know which way to go. And the same with bio warfare. There's some things you
*  don't do because it might come back at you. Well, if you throw these things down a gravity well,
*  the risk is lower, or at least it would be very hard to get the disease back to you, you know,
*  there's six months between places. So, you know, it's just speculative, but like, you know, it's
*  worth in your equation adding that there is at least some risk of the existential risk increasing
*  as a result of going multi planetary in the same solar system. I think the existential risk
*  increases in the near term as well. So, you know, for example, if we're starting on the moon,
*  which we probably will, there's very, very small surface area that's like the best spots on the
*  moon. And those are the spots where you've got water and where you've got the rims and you can
*  get more, your solar panels can get light for more of the time. So it's very clear where we're going
*  to be scrambling for when we start going to the moon. And we have this international law regime
*  that's sort of unclear about what you're able to do when you get there. And right now we've got this
*  new emerging space race between China and the US for these great spots on the moon. And whereas the
*  space race with the Soviet Union was more who can just touch down first and that's it. Now with China
*  and the US, we're talking about places where you're going to set up for forever and people
*  starting lunar economies. And it sounds more like a scramble for land and you know, between nuclear
*  wielding superpowers who are getting along less and less well as time goes on. So that's concerning.
*  I liked the TV show Space Force. I know a lot of people didn't, but I thought it was hilarious
*  with Steve Carroll. Sorry that that one got canceled, but it was about exactly those issues.
*  So we should take them seriously, I think. But okay, so basically you're saying that in our,
*  the irony would be that in trying to eliminate some existential risks, we've created a giant new
*  existential risk and that is something we should worry about. And if you're interested in more on
*  that, you should read Daniel Dudney's Dark Skies because that whole book is about how going to space
*  could be really bad for Earth. He's an international relations guy, so he's very explicitly concerned
*  with that aspect of the question. Okay, well moving on to slightly happier topics. I'm a little bit
*  surprised that of the many science experiments that have been done on the space station, we haven't
*  done multi-generational animal reproduction. I mean, if we are serious, like you say, about
*  living in space, we got to do that. Are there plans to do that? Are there hopes?
*  So I would say that there's a couple problems. So one, NASA is very squeamish about sex.
*  They don't want... Even rat sex?
*  Even rat sex. No, it's like, it's hard to get access to the NASA researchers who study sex
*  because what they say to journalists is very tightly controlled. And so NASA doesn't want to
*  get in trouble with the taxpayers. They don't want to talk about alcohol in space. They don't
*  want to talk about sex in space. And also, I would argue that the International Space Station,
*  as far as I know, the stated goal of the space station wasn't as a stepping stone to settlements.
*  And so if that's not one of the explicit goals, then there's plenty of short-term things you want
*  to understand, like the astronauts who were up there for two years, how was that impacting their
*  body? And can we keep doing this or is it not safe for them? And so, go ahead.
*  To add to that, so one way to think about NASA is as this agency that started with the Apollo
*  program. And it's all Apollo. It's all beating the Soviets. It's a political act. And then that's
*  done. And then the question is, what now? There's a historian named John Lodgdon. He's one of the
*  preeminent historians. He referred to as what happened afterward as a 40-year identity crisis.
*  I think he might say 50 years now. And so, if NASA was set up as the settle the moon agency,
*  then you would expect that on the space stations, we would have a systematic series of experiments,
*  but we don't. It's one of the frustrating things when you're trying to answer a question about
*  something like space psychology is what you just have is 40 years of grab bag. You have lots of
*  experiments done by lots of people in different settings without a kind of unified, we need to
*  know this for sure aspect. And so, we talk about this at the very end of the book. If you were
*  making the like Zach and Kelly are in charge of the NASA settles space agency or whatever,
*  one of the priority things would be you would want to orient around a systemic, systematic program
*  to just answer questions. Frustratingly, with a lot of space stuff that doesn't have an objective
*  measure, like loss of bone density or something, it's really hard to get answers in part because
*  of that lack of systematicity. And so, when you look at, we tried to find every single experiment
*  we could relating to gametes or reproduction or reproductive health or hormones. And it's just,
*  there's just a lot of experiments and you are there to make sense of them. There's not a kind
*  of textbook approach. So, that is why we don't have that kind of thing. NASA is not dedicated
*  to settlement or anything like that. And as you do make a pretty good case in the book,
*  that when it comes to psychology, you've given the actual human subjects a huge incentive to
*  not tell the truth about their psychology. So, basically nothing is reliable.
*  No, we read stacks and stacks and stacks of astronaut and cosmonaut biographies,
*  translating them with Google Translate. And they almost all lie about their mental and physical
*  health. And it's the incentives, if they say, oh, you know what, actually, I'm depressed,
*  I'm having a bit of a panic attack, you don't get to go up for another flight. And so, we found,
*  and same thing, like you can't say, oh, you know what, I'm having some chest pain, maybe it's a
*  heart attack, you're not going to go up to space. And so, there were stories about, you know,
*  one guy thought he was having a heart attack, didn't say anything. Another guy thought he had
*  bone cancer. Was that the same guy? It was the same guy. It was Walter Cunningham.
*  He looked like he was a heart chondriac.
*  I guess so, yeah.
*  Mike Malane removed papers from his medical records because somebody was stupid enough to
*  let him travel with them. So, he just ripped them out. But he said that he would have lied
*  about a glass eye if he thought he could get away with it. Oh, the guy who cheated on a vision test.
*  Oh, yeah, he memorized those card tests where there's a number hidden in the dots. So,
*  he memorized those. There's another story. I think it was maybe Bassett, who was an astronaut
*  candidate who unfortunately died in an accident. But I believe he was the one who stayed up all
*  night jumping up and down to get his height down because of the height limit. Another one,
*  or maybe it was the same one, learned to slouch just a little to get under the limit.
*  I think only once has this actually been a problem. There was one cosmonaut who went up who had a
*  health problem that had started beforehand. If he had admitted it, they probably wouldn't have let
*  him go. And he had to come back. And it was interesting because one of the women cosmonauts,
*  instead of being like, oh, poor guy, she was mad at him because he didn't continue the lie. She's
*  like, look, we all lie. The problem isn't that he lied. But if you lie, you have to suck it up and
*  you finish your mission. And he messed stuff up so she didn't get to go. And so she was furious,
*  not that he lied, but that he didn't go all the way through with it because that's what you're
*  supposed to do. So there's some open questions about the psychology. I do want to maybe we can
*  at least speculate about the physiology, in particular of a newborn baby. Like, I'm going
*  to guess a baby that is born and raised on the moon will have a tough time coming back to Earth.
*  At least that's what my science fiction readings would lead me to believe.
*  Yes. No, I agree with what I think that was in the expanse. Also, like I agree, a baby that is
*  developing under, you know, one sixth or 40% gravity, they might not have bones that are strong
*  enough to survive entry through Earth's atmosphere and then landing on Earth and walking around. And
*  to be quite honest, we don't even know if, you know, human hips can handle childbirth.
*  And after a lifetime at, you know, some percent of Earth's gravity.
*  I was just going to say you should give the number on that. So like in microgravity, what was it?
*  One, you lose 1.5% of aerial bone mineral density, which I think is a measure of osteoporosis. So 1.5%
*  of that in your hips is lost per month. Per month. But again, that's in complete free fall. You don't
*  know how much better that gets when you're at 40%. Maybe that gets rid of the loss entirely,
*  but maybe not. And one thing I would add to that, there's a great quote. I found an interview with
*  April Ronca, who's like the person in NASA who's maybe the top babies in space. That's not her
*  title, but you know what I mean. It's someone had asked her, and I can't remember what book this was,
*  or something like, hey, are we going to have like longer legs on Mars? And she said something like,
*  I don't know. Like, it's a very human thing to be like, there's less gravity, so longer legs.
*  There's all sorts of mechanisms in your body, and we don't know how they're going to respond.
*  So there's stuff that might be unpredictable, which means it might be fine as well. One of
*  the big surprises of the early space program was that you could eat fine. That was an open question.
*  It's kind of weird, frankly, that you can eat, and it basically works. Apparently burping is dicey,
*  but generally speaking, zero gravity. But generally speaking, it works, which is like,
*  I don't know, for me, it's kind of surprising. You can eat stuff, and it goes to the right place,
*  and this body could evolve. And okay, I mean, this does speak to the idea that the first time we go
*  to Mars, we won't be coming back, right? I've often guessed, but maybe you're the experts here,
*  that the first humans to visit Mars will be on a one-way trip, because it's just so difficult
*  to come back. And then maybe if you have generations there, they have no choice but not to come back.
*  I don't know. If it were up to me, the first people to go to Mars would be like, you know,
*  six crew on a NASA mission, and they come back. I think there's a lot that we need to learn,
*  and it would be nice to go there, stay for a little while, and come back. I don't think the
*  first time we send them there, we should be leaving them there. I mean, I could be wrong. I don't
*  think there are any serious proposals to just leave them there. I think usually there's some
*  orbital mechanics stuff, but I think there's actually a trajectory where they would stay on
*  Mars for just a month and then come back. It's not usually popular because what a waste.
*  The usual trajectory is six months inbound, and then I think something like two years later,
*  it's six months outbound. But I think even with someone like Robert Zubrin, who's very much a
*  daredevil when it comes to other people's safety on their Mars trip, still proposes that you send
*  a robot system ahead to rack up methane as propellant on the way out. So no, I don't know.
*  I would say this, there's good evidence that there would be volunteers for a one-way Mars trip. But I
*  think at least if you're talking about sending a few people out for the very first boots on the
*  ground, I don't know of any proposals that would just leave someone there.
*  Well, it does bring us to the question of government versus private efforts in these
*  directions. It would be cheaper to send people there one way, and if it's not the government
*  doing it, like you said, there will be volunteers. So I'm very open to the possibility that that will
*  be first. Okay, well, sure. However, so if Elon Musk, for example, wanted to send a bunch of people
*  to Mars and just leave them there, according to international law, the things that happen on Mars
*  are the responsibility of the United States. And I'm assuming that Elon Musk is launching from the
*  US, and he's from the US, so he's the US's responsibility. So the FAA should be thinking
*  about the ethical implications of this before they allow it to happen. So there is some oversight,
*  but with all the geopolitical power Musk seems to have right now, as you show him with Starlink and
*  this Ukraine stuff, I don't know, maybe he'd get away with it. But it's not like private companies
*  can make these decisions completely on their own. Yeah, I would also add, there's this argument we
*  encounter a lot from Space People who's like, well, so we talk a lot about international law,
*  we think it matters, and there are a lot of constraints. You'll get a lot of Space People
*  who'll be like, Elon Musk and me are going to the moon, and it's none of your business, and you have
*  no way to stop us because we have the rockets, which is basically just bogus. And if you want
*  to convince yourself, ask yourself if Elon Musk has ever said anything bad about the Communist Party
*  of China, right? Elon Musk has business interests on this planet. And so if he does something that
*  actively antagonizes every country on Earth, there are going to be consequences that will make him
*  sad. Also, if he goes, so in the Starlink's terms of service, he essentially said, like when we go
*  to Mars, we're not going to be bound by Earth law. That straightforwardly flies in the face
*  of international law, including treaties that have been signed by the United States. And so,
*  you know, and China and Russia, all the major space powers, this is a highly ratified document.
*  So if he goes to Mars and is like, ha, you idiots, let me come here. And now we've got our own
*  nation and I'm not listening to anybody, then it would be the FAA's responsibility to say, fine,
*  none of your resupply ships can take off. So like, even after they leave, we still have some control
*  if the US government decides to exercise it. I guess, you know, I'm trying to think of your
*  exact question. I suppose I don't know what would happen if like, Elon Musk paid for a venture to
*  the North Pole and it was badly planned and everyone died. Like, what would be the consequences?
*  And I honestly don't know. It seems like when Elon Musk does something, no matter how badly
*  it goes, everyone thinks it's cool. So I don't know.
*  Not Twitter or X. I don't agree.
*  Yeah. All right. All right. But so in terms of like the sort of specifics, I don't know. But in terms
*  of like setting up a settlement, it would be a really bad move to antagonize Earth. And I would
*  add one thing we talk about is people tend to talk about these things as abstractions. Like a
*  settlement is set up by a private company. But in reality, the private company is from somewhere.
*  And so suppose you say the private company, quote unquote private, is from China. That feels
*  geopolitically very different than it being from the US. Right. So if Elon Musk surprises us
*  tomorrow with 10,000 people on Mars, I don't know. Maybe the US is like hooray. China probably is not.
*  In Star Trek, Earth is a unified front.
*  Not yet here in the real world.
*  No. They're going to be particulars. Yeah.
*  Well, you do get a lot and in an emberable way into the legal side of things in the book. So
*  let's just get that clear. How much of legality has been settled for these things? There is,
*  of course, the outer space treaty. That was a long time ago. Maybe we're still paying attention to
*  it. Or is this a set of rules that are going to be swept away once we get real?
*  Well, so we hope not. So we are certainly still paying attention to that treaty and a couple
*  others that came in the next decade after that. And those treaties still do things like govern
*  how our satellites move around and who's responsible. And you have to register the
*  satellites when you send them up. And so those documents are living and we're using them
*  every day. So then the question is, do the parts that relate to the moon,
*  appropriation of land, is that going to get ignored when we get there? And certainly there
*  are plenty of people who propose that if Earth gets there first, we should just scrap the outer
*  space treaty. And sure, it was great. It helped us in some other areas.
*  The US gets there first?
*  Yeah.
*  You said Earth gets there first.
*  Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. If the US gets there first.
*  Earth will get there first.
*  Yeah. Yeah. We can feel pretty sure about that. But some people think you should scrap it,
*  but the important parts of the outer space treaty, the most important part is it says you're not
*  allowed to appropriate land. So if Elon Musk gets to Mars and he says, this is Moscow and this is
*  my country or my city or whatever, that is not allowed by international law. But it is unclear
*  if he's allowed to do any mining on the moon and sell that for profit. And so is that different
*  than appropriation? The US has made it clear that our interpretation is that yes, extracting and
*  selling resources is not the same thing as appropriating that land. That is okay. You can
*  do that. But I think there's some countries, particularly in the developing world, who would
*  say, no, we're not okay with that. The moon and Mars and all the celestial bodies, that's supposed
*  to be a global commons. And you don't get to do whatever you want to it. And so-
*  Yeah. And it's not just that you can't do whatever you want. I would add that if you try to do
*  something like that, you are antagonizing most of the governments of Earth. It's nontrivial.
*  And power might override. It might be that the US is powerful enough that we're just going to do it
*  and we're going to take our chances. We kind of hope not. But-
*  The other thing I would add too, and as far as I know, we're the only book that gets deeply into
*  the broader context of international law. It could be very easy to read The Outer Space Treatise,
*  some sort of freak 1960s law where we commonize space. But it was like a moment of weirdness. But
*  actually that's not exactly, but very similar to how the Antarctic Treaty System works,
*  very similar to how the seabed works. So every time in the 20th century, humanity was called upon
*  to regulate a newly accessible region of the universe, we picked a commons. And that has been
*  sustained. And the really important thing- Oh, sorry, I was banging the desk. I'm not supposed
*  to do that. Bad sound. The other point I wanted to make, so people generally will say to us when
*  we talk about this, they'll say something like, well, it doesn't matter because once there's big
*  money to be made in space, all bets are off. We're going to go get it. And the thing is,
*  one, we don't believe there's big money to be made in space. But set that aside, in Antarctica,
*  there was a push to make something called Cramera happen. Cramera, I will never remember what the
*  acronym was. I think they are as resources. But the idea was make it so that the commons of Antarctica
*  could be accessed for resources. And my understanding, and this is iffy, if for reasons
*  I'll get to, there's at least some evidence there might have been profitable neural resources in
*  Antarctica. Remember, it's a whole continent that's never been mined. And in 1998, the consortium
*  of nations in Antarctica decided to put a moratorium not just on exploiting, but on even
*  looking to see if there was stuff to exploit that is in force till 2048 and can only be removed by
*  unanimous agreement. So there was a very plausible case for getting resources and the planet Earth
*  said no. And the reasons were that we didn't want to get in a big giant fight over it and that there
*  was an environmental outcry. So it's not at all obvious to me that we're going to suddenly go get
*  it no matter what, no matter what the consequences are, if there's money to be made. If I take the
*  words of the outer space treaty literally, does that mean that if someone else goes to the moon
*  and builds a habitat and then I fly up there, I can just like walk in and open their fridge and,
*  you know, sleep in their living room? You are supposed to give them prior notice and ask nicely,
*  you are supposed to be able to like visit other people's stuff in space. They can tell you,
*  you know, for safety reasons, I can't let you in, you know, but yes, you are supposed to.
*  But I should say, I mean, I didn't think you were gonna go there. I love the example of you going
*  to the fridge. By the way, there's no fridge on the island. I think they just sent up a fridge.
*  They just sent up a fridge. Okay, they have a fridge now. But what's funny, it is actually
*  illustrated because like the original agreement really only countenances nations. It's, you know,
*  I mean, there was a big debate at the time, but really it's for a two superpower world.
*  So, you know, I don't think they were thinking about a fridge raid.
*  They weren't thinking about Sean Carroll, but they should have been.
*  Yeah, I think the rules are more about like formal, can we come over to the Chinese module
*  and inspect to make sure you're not doing something that scares us.
*  And to be fair, the space lawyers that I talked to were, I was like, oh, there's it's so vague.
*  And it was made back then and things have changed. And they're like, no, that is a feature,
*  not a bug. We didn't know what was coming. We were, we were vague so that this stuff could
*  get worked out later and we wouldn't be hamstringing everything. And it's, and I
*  guess the problem is that back then countries were way more likely to work together to solve stuff.
*  And now you can't get anything related to space through the United Nations.
*  You can't get any big formal treaty. Right. Right. You can get resolutions and things.
*  Tons of resolutions. Yeah, sorry. Big, highly ratified treaties. We haven't had anything
*  related to space since what, 1975? And that wasn't ratified by most of the countries that
*  mattered as far as it, as far as going to space.
*  It's interesting. I mean, let's not let that pass by too quickly, our increasing inability
*  to work together on these things. Would you chalk that up more to the fact that when it was less
*  realistic, we were more idealistic or is it just that the world in general is less good at
*  working together? So I think that when we first made these treaties, we did think that this stuff
*  was going to come faster than it did. So I do think that there was concern when we started
*  going to the moon that, that, you know, U S would get there first and then maybe they'd start
*  claiming stuff and, you know, the Soviet union might've worried about that. And so they,
*  they wanted to cut that sort of stuff off at the pass. And so why are we less good?
*  And so, so yeah, yeah, to add a little to that. So like, we have a quote, there's a guy named
*  Oscar, Oscar Schachter, Schachter or Schachter. Okay. His name is Oscar and we quote him,
*  but he was an important international relations guy, international relations people know.
*  He wrote in the fifties that he was concerned about a future where people would plant the flag
*  and make claims like back in the bad 19th century. Right. Yeah. And so,
*  um, that concern was already percolating and there's a scholar named James Clay Maltz
*  and we cite him and he argues, I think pretty convincingly that part of what happened is that
*  in the early sixties, I think in 62 and 63, there were high atmospheric and in orbit tests of nuclear
*  weapons, which so thoroughly terrified everyone that people were willing to come to the table.
*  So in other words, you know, we actually, we, we talk about this as maybe relevant to the current
*  AI discourse is it's like, you know, we got space law, not because well, not necessarily because
*  everybody was so good at working together back in the sixties, but in part because we had scared
*  ourselves. Um, and there were enough rational people to say, that's, that's scary. And then
*  the one other thing I would add is there is a kind of pragmatic thing here, which is there are a lot
*  more countries now. Um, so, so a lot of, you know, the higher of decolonization is 1945 to 1975.
*  There was still a lot to be done when the first, you know, the treaty assigned 1967, the first big
*  proposal that's basically the treaty is 1963. So there are just a lot more countries now. Um, and
*  there's not this sort of bipolar too big powers that kind of run spheres and people obey them.
*  Like countries can say no to all of us, you know? And so like, there is just simply a pragmatic
*  aspect. Um, that, that said, you know, in close the law of the sea, uh, with a lot of negotiating
*  over decades was widely ratified, except not by the U S but okay. Um, and that was 1994. So it's
*  not impossible. Um, but, but the law of the sea, there was some urgency, you know, there was
*  emergency about figuring out how territorial waters and stuff works, where space historically,
*  you know, post let's say like mid seventies has felt non-urgent and that may be changing with the
*  new advances in technology. So we're again, if we're obeying the outer space treaty,
*  we're imagining that we have settlements, uh, on the moon or on Mars, but they're not,
*  they don't belong to specific nation states or for that matter, to specific private entities,
*  I guess, same thing would go. Just slight nuance that the station itself would probably belong to
*  the, the, the, the nation and the company, but the land under land would not claim the territory.
*  Right. So it's a, you know, it's zany. You could, if you had a base, the size of the moon in
*  principle, that base is yours, uh, but the land under it is not. Okay. And I mean, at some point,
*  again, if I get any lessons from all my science fiction reading, uh, a couple hundred years,
*  the moon will revolt and shake off the shackles of earth and become their own nation state.
*  It does seem like a potential problem to me. You know, I, especially as a U S citizen,
*  we really like having our own property. We like property rights. It's possible that, uh,
*  the society that develops on the moon will be less concerned about property rights and stuff, but you,
*  you can definitely imagine them getting really angry, uh, and revolting and, and maybe one day
*  they get to start their own state. But, uh, so one of the chapters we're really proud of, like,
*  I don't know if it's anybody else's favorite, but it was like our favorite is one on state creation,
*  which is you're like, so you have this deep norm in international law. You hear the words, um, uh,
*  not self-determination, uh, territorial integrity. Like you've, since the Ukraine invasion, like every
*  other word at the UN is territorial integrity. And this is a deep norm that nations cannot be
*  dismembered. And yet countries come into existence from time to time. Um, and it just turns out
*  there's a process and drastically oversimplifying. There's a lot more detail in the book.
*  Generally speaking, it is recognized that a group of people are deeply put upon, deeply oppressed.
*  They may have some right to take part of a country for themselves. Now the standard is very high.
*  Uh, there's a big case in 1998 concerning Quebec, which basically said no, although with a lot of
*  nuance, they can't do it essentially because Quebecois people, however they feel about oppression,
*  they can, they can vote, they can hold office, et cetera, et cetera. You know, uh, you know,
*  like as opposed to say Jews in 1930s, Germany, or like native Americans for, you know,
*  much of the last several, a long time. Yeah, very long time. Yeah, exactly. So, so the modern law,
*  which obviously was not enforced in the 19th century, but the modern view is there, you know,
*  in the classic case for this is Bangladesh. If a people are under deep oppression by some government,
*  they may have a right to what's called remedial secession. Um, so there, and meaning, so you can
*  do this quote unquote illegal thing of dismembering a nation if there's an extreme circumstance that
*  pertains to national identity. But here for the first time you'd be taking out part of the global
*  commons and making it the property of a group of people, which would be a sort of new, totally new,
*  totally new thing. But, but you can imagine it working out at some point if they end up feeling
*  super oppressed, if they're, if they've been super oppressed. Well, and so the issue, just to be clear,
*  like it's not like you magically get to be a state because you're oppressed. It's just that
*  being oppressed makes you more likely to be recognized by the global community as having
*  a right to a particular territory. So there's some world in which you can imagine for some reason,
*  a moon settlement revolts and most of the countries from earth say immediately, yes,
*  that's legitimate, even though they're taking out of the commons, but that's very unexplored
*  territory. Okay. I mean, it does also, it gives me an opportunity to go back a little bit because I
*  think we maybe went a little bit too quickly for my taste over the self-sustainability question.
*  Like if the moon did want to secede, they would probably first want to not be dependent
*  on shipments from earth. So precisely how realistic is that? I mean, let's just say,
*  let's say it this way. Is it within present technology, if we throw enough money at the
*  problem, or do we need new scientific breakthroughs to have a truly self-sustaining
*  settlement on the moon? Well, so first I'd say that I think you can get a state made,
*  even if they're not completely self-sufficient, because no state on earth is completely
*  self-sufficient either. And so I think the moon could still come up with trade agreements with
*  different countries, but create their own state. But in terms of what it would take to be able to
*  go to survive on your own. I think for us, the clearest example is the need for computer chips
*  to run your, like your habitat is going to very much depend on technology. You're going to need
*  these computer chips at the moment. Like what all the stations are, all the places that make it are
*  in Taiwan, though we're trying to get one in the U S I'm not completely up to date on all of this.
*  Zach probably is, but like, these are things that require a lot of water. There's a very complicated
*  factory to make, and they're so lightweight that, you know, they'd be real, you could ship
*  tons and tons of them, you know, on a rocket, you could get a bunch of them to Mars, for example.
*  So it's going to be a long time before Mars is like, all right, we're going to make our own chip
*  factory. And also when you think about like, you know, you live in a big major country and you've
*  got specialists for all these different kinds of medical problems that you could have, like, you
*  know, there's something, you know, there's thousands of medical specialties. And so the number of
*  people that you would need to have, like the medical specialists that you need, the like
*  professors that you need, the tech or the engineers that you need, we're probably talking about like a
*  million or more people. And what looks like you're going to say something? Yeah, I was just going to,
*  I'm glad we'll have the professors. That's, uh, we can do without them. Okay. But so like, so like
*  Cuba and North Korea are not even self-sustaining and they have the benefit of being able to breathe
*  the air when they walk outside and they still need support. And so you're going to need huge
*  populations to make this happen. It's going to be a while. Yes. We did try to find like, is there a
*  good estimate for how many people you would need on Mars to create autarky? And basically the
*  answer is we don't know. There's not a good answer. So I'm sorry, autarky economic self-sufficiency.
*  So like, you know, historically some communist countries have been interested in this. Probably
*  the closest country is the DPRK, you know, North Korea, but they still have plenty of interaction
*  with outside world and also it's awful there. And so we did try to find numbers. There are some very
*  hand-wavy numbers by a couple of people. The lowest estimate that we found by a guy who was very pro
*  settlement was a hundred thousand people and that assumed extraordinary advances in AI and robotics.
*  So it's a huge, huge number of people. You're not talking, it's not going to be like, it's not going
*  to be like a Heinlein novel where there's like a hundred guys and then they work it out. You know,
*  it's not going to be anything like that. That's interesting. Is that demanding a kind of
*  modern first world standard of living or is it really just surviving from day to day?
*  Well, I would say it's a kind of combination, right? So you're right. It's just surviving,
*  but like, okay, so if you went to like, if you found a deserted island with like coconuts and
*  pigs, you know, you don't need a lot of technology, right? So you could live a happy non-first world
*  existence. On Mars, you have to have a first world existence in that you will die without like a
*  nuclear reactor and computer chips and all sorts of stuff. So yeah, so that's the thing is it's not
*  like, it's not like any situation on earth, right? You just can't exist without the technology. So,
*  you know, you might not need, I don't know, like someone running a sauna or like luxuries or
*  whatever. You might like them, but maybe you don't need them, but you certainly need like advanced
*  technology and that kind of thing. Yeah, maybe you have fewer medical specialists and fewer
*  professors. Oh, go ahead. But yeah, like Zach said, you need the technology. Yeah, so I can't remember
*  who mentioned this in the book, but one thing that was really eye-opening for me in just thinking
*  about this question, so I was talking to an aerospace friend of ours named Manfred,
*  we're saying his name wrong, I'm sure he's from Germany, but anyway, you know, we were talking
*  about this question of like, could you even model how much like energy you would need to run a
*  million people on Mars? And you know, we decided that it would take 30 grad students in 10 years,
*  it would be wrong by the time you got an answer. But like, I thought this was a really good
*  observation. He said, you know, on earth, the cheapest, most efficient way to shift stuff from
*  here to there is on a boat, right? So somehow, if you're calculating your energy needs, you have to
*  factor in that you no longer have free highways between most of the cities on earth. And so that
*  and that's just one little thing. I mean, it's like you try to imagine the energy needs you're
*  going to need with all the things we take for granted go away, it's going to be extraordinary.
*  So it seems like there'd be probably one big metropolis on the moon, not that those million
*  people are not going to be in 110,000 person settlements. Well, it might depend on the
*  distribution of resources on the moon. So like, you know, you'll probably you might get them at
*  both poles so that there's enough water. So I guess it might depend on what it is that they're mining.
*  Why are they there? Yeah, yeah, it's also like, so Kelly mentioned earlier, we have this thing we
*  call premium real estate, which is like, there's actually like the moon, I think it's an area about
*  the size of the continental US. It's quite big. The actual desirable parts of the moon are teeny
*  weeny. So I can imagine a world in which so the one thing we didn't talk about is lava tubes. And
*  like, by the way, we're being like pessimistic lava tubes is like the coolest thing in the whole
*  solar system. There are these cases, Earth has lava tubes, maybe some of your listeners have
*  been to the ones in Hawaii, imagine them blown up by like 100x, that might be what they're like on
*  the moon, there are models that at least suggest that. So like these absolutely extraordinary
*  caverns, which would be a great place to set up a base because instead of like bringing a habitat
*  or building it on site, you just seal off the walls, not that it's easy, just seal off the walls
*  and lunar caves. But like, you know, once you do that, you have your bubble. And then you can start
*  doing the other stuff. And that protects you from radiation and from temperature swings and the
*  regolith. So the popular when you say a metropolis, like part of the metropolis, this is constrained
*  by how big the good spots are, right? So it might be more like, you know, if there are only half a
*  dozen really good lava tubes, and we know there's only a small number of these places where you can
*  get water and perpetual near perpetual sunlight, I would actually guess you'd have a small set of
*  distributed places. Also, I presume that would provide some level of resiliency,
*  if something went wrong. But but you know, hard to speculate.
*  Did we learn anything from biosphere to difficult it is to have a truly closed ecosystem?
*  We learned how difficult it is for sure. So biosphere was 3.14 acres, substantially larger
*  and more complicated than anything that we, you know, could hope to make on Mars in the next decade
*  or two. And in that system, one, they had to pipe in oxygen because the cement was messing with their
*  atmosphere. And they all were getting like headaches and stumbling around. And so they had to get more
*  oxygen. There were stowaways, there were these bark scorpions, which fun fact, are the only lethal
*  scorpions in the US and they had managed to get in there. I think cockroaches also were a problem.
*  They there were there were problems that were getting so the original plan was to run this
*  simulation many, many times for two year periods and learn as you go. And there was stuff that they
*  were learning, like the chickens that they picked weren't laying enough eggs, and the pigs were
*  trying to eat the chickens and the mangoes hadn't started was it bananas or one of their fruit trees
*  hadn't started started to produce yet. And so I think it just proves that one of the things that
*  it taught us is that it takes a long time to figure this out. And to be honest, I think it
*  also taught us that you don't want to start with one giant system. You want lots of little ones
*  where you tinker with a couple variables and figure out how those work. And then you work on
*  scaling up. It also taught us that human psychology is difficult. So it was what six groups, eight,
*  eight who split into two hateful factions where they were literally sitting on each other when
*  they were angry. And they needed to call out to therapists for emotional support,
*  which is going to be hard on Mars with a 22 minute conversation delay. You can't have live
*  chats with your psychiatrist if you're on Mars. And so I think there's a lot that you don't want
*  a megalomaniac running the no. Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. The only thing I would add is,
*  is eight people in these three acres, they were starving by the end. Yes, they were, you know,
*  they lost between 10 to 18% of their body mass. And that is with them working all day on this
*  system to try just to survive. They're not trying to do cool space people stuff, right? They're just
*  trying to not die. And all the power is supplied from the grid. Right. Unless you can incident
*  life on the plants. Right. But can I just say, you know, we all make fun of Biosphere too. And I'm
*  happy there's so many funny things about it and stupid things they did. But it's worth noting it
*  did basically kind of work. I'm a believer that if you know, there was no reason to do this,
*  but if the billionaire they convinced to throw whatever it was $200 million at this project,
*  if they had continued it for the ensuing 30 years, I do think we would have learned a whole lot.
*  Because, you know, like the last textbook written on closed loop ecologies from like 2003,
*  you know, this is a whole it's a cool thing. Like there are a lot of interesting questions you could
*  I can't buy that the last textbook on closed loop ecology was 2003. Okay.
*  We'll ask Chachi PT. But yeah, so like, you know, the big questions are things like,
*  what is the optimal setup to like generate consumables? And almost certainly their system,
*  which was, you know, the guy in charge was this kind of crazy dude named John Allen, who was like
*  three quarters artist, one quarter engineer. And so they did a lot of crazy stuff. Like they were
*  like, we want a ghost desert, which is not a thing with ghosts. It's like an actual ecosystem.
*  But like, so we went to coral reef, it was like very 90s Captain Planet, you know, and so presumably,
*  if they were a little more careful, they probably should have just made the whole thing agriculture
*  and some other stuff. But like, who knows, maybe those biomes are really useful. Yeah.
*  So we could have found out a lot. But I still feel like that money would have been spent better on
*  lots of little ones. So for example, China has lunar palace. And they had a situation where they
*  had three crew members in their like closed loop system. And they're the breathing gases where it
*  was like too much carbon dioxide was building up. So they switched out two big guys for two smaller
*  women. And then it worked. And that's where we are right now. Like where you got to hop around mass
*  to make it work. And so like, we don't have the science figured out yet with like all the
*  calculations you'd want before you send someone to Mars. So there's still a lot to learn.
*  I'm guessing it will would make sense even if maybe it's not absolutely necessary for
*  the first Martian colonists to be all vegans. Yes. Yeah. I would say about that. I'm a vegetarian.
*  You're almost certainly right in terms of like converting energy to calories. But you know,
*  psychology is a thing. You know, like you can you can be you know, if you look at the very early
*  NASA food, it's literally like food cubes and gelatin stuff. And everyone hated it. So I do
*  think you want to be open to tolerating some level of inefficiency for like sanity.
*  A lot of the proposals for early settlements, they were proposing mealworms and crickets as
*  like a protein source because those are easy to grow and you can grow them on the like scraps
*  from the vegetable garden. And then there is a lot of proposals for cellular meat. So if you can grow
*  like beef in a vat and that technology seems to be making pretty good gains. But the closely loop
*  ecosystem people that I talked to were pushing for like fungus and you know, you can make fungus
*  taste vegetarian vegetarian vegetarianism, maybe not veganism. Yeah. Right here on the cover of
*  your book, there's a little perspective drawing of settlement and one of the very few buildings
*  that is labeled is called cricket ranch. So yeah, very, very briefly, I guess the evidence is that
*  the bigger the animal, the less efficient you're going to get at converting energy to calories.
*  Right. So you're not eating beef. You're not eating chicken. Just keep going down. You'll arrive at
*  something like crickets. And that is the set. I mean, again, I mean, there are, I should say,
*  we're Americans, there are places where they eat crickets and it's not a big deal and it's not weird.
*  It's a normal dietary item. So like maybe just don't send Westerners send those people there.
*  They're obviously better adapted to this environment.
*  Send the Buddhists. They'll just be happy.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And I mean, speaking of potentially unanticipated resource needs, we're reading a lot of articles
*  these days about giant computing facilities that are either doing crypto mining or AI calculations
*  and they need both a tremendous amount of energy, but also a tremendous amount of cooling, right?
*  A huge amount of water is being used up by these. Is that something we're just not going to be able
*  to have on the moon or is there some more clever way to answer these problems?
*  That's a really interesting question. Fun fact, Biosphere 2 actually had a computing center in
*  its basement. This was 1993 or something. It was called the Technosphere because that's how they
*  did things. And then they actually needed it though to monitor all the ecological stuff. So I doubt
*  it's going to be on the scale of like some crazy crypto rig or like whatever they're doing for these
*  LLMs, but like you are going to need something, right? Because again, you're surviving on
*  technology. So if something goes wrong with like the CO2 scrubbing or some of your gases entered
*  the environment or whatever, you do need a system monitoring everything. In terms of cooling,
*  that I actually have no idea. I mean, assume what you do if you didn't have water, I guess you could
*  dig down like, because these are not seismic. Well, they're lightly seismically active. So
*  maybe it would be like very cool underground or something. But honestly, it's not something we
*  thought deeply about. I think there's enough water on Mars that you could do it without too much
*  trouble. I mean, it would be a pain to get it initially. You'd want to recycle it. You'd have it pretty far along, I would think.
*  When they're working on nuclear reactors for Mars to help provide more power because, you know, on
*  Mars you get these dust storms that can last for weeks and they sort of are hard to predict. And so
*  you're not going to want to rely on your solar panels. So, you know, you could use some nuclear
*  power too. Yeah. But I would just say like questions like that are part of why this is so difficult
*  because you tend to think in terms of like, well, we need a box of oxygen and some food. But actually
*  there's all this little stuff. Yeah. All right. We're reaching the end, but I have a couple of
*  very easy questions to wrap up with. One is we already touched on this a little bit, but war
*  in space. I think part of the outer space treaty is you're not supposed to send weapons up there,
*  but it's a little bit vague on military operations more generally. I mean, is this,
*  as we might've imagined back in the sixties, is this a whole new theater for good old
*  nationalistic countries to work out their aggressions on each other? So you're not
*  allowed to send weapons of mass destruction. So I think technically you could like, you know,
*  strap a gun to your satellite and use it to shoot another satellite, but that would be very much
*  frowned upon. So at the moment, I think it's mostly folks don't want to be starting an arms race
*  on the moon. And in the United Nations, there's resolutions all the time to, you know, how are
*  we going to deal with this potential emerging arms race in space? We already from land shoot down
*  satellites that are in space and we've never shot down another country satellite, but we have
*  shot down our own country satellite just to make sure everyone knows that we can do that.
*  Russia actually threatened it. Go ahead. Yeah.
*  Didn't China shoot down one of its own satellites from space? Didn't get in trouble for doing that?
*  I thought they had shot it down, shot a ground to space missile.
*  And they got in trouble because it was high enough up that the debris is going to take a really long
*  time to fall. And that was what got them to compare. India did an ASAT test, I think in 2019
*  and you know, people frowned upon it, but it was in very low earth orbit. So it was like less of
*  an environmental issue. Yeah. We didn't even mention space trash and space debris overall.
*  Is that overblown or is that going to be one of the real concerns?
*  We have less expertise on that. I mean, space is really big and it hasn't been a problem yet. I do
*  think there's a tendency to think crazy space billionaires because they're crazy space billionaires
*  don't care about this stuff. But there are actually systems in place for everyone to
*  communicate with everyone and to move stuff up and down. I mean, I wouldn't want to be living
*  in a rotating space station in low earth orbit with all that debris, but I wouldn't worry about
*  it if I was on the moon or Mars or L5 or something like that. Right. Yeah. I mean, you have to
*  remember it's like, you know, so if you go to 300 miles, that's one shell. If you go to 310,
*  that's another shell. 320, that's another shell. I mean, of course, everything's going quite fast.
*  But, you know, I mean, for example, there, I forget the exact number, it's something like
*  37 nuclear reactors are in space currently between, I think, like 700 and a thousand miles high. And
*  I don't think, you know, it's obviously a weird thing to say, but I don't think people actually
*  worry too much about them. Nuclear reactors in space. Yeah. It's fine. Absolutely true,
*  but we don't really worry about it that much. Okay. So then here's the last question. We sort
*  of squirted around this one. How much is this going to cost? Like it sounds like it'll be very
*  expensive to put a million people in a city on the moon. And maybe we can fold into this.
*  If we, you've done a very, very good job, I think, of letting us know all of the worries and maybe
*  the extent to which people don't take the worries seriously enough. But if we allow ourselves to be
*  a little optimistic, when could this possibly happen if everything broke right for us? So how
*  much does it cost and when is it going to happen? Sure. So cost, I mean, so let me just say a priori
*  in both these questions, I'm going to have to be fairly hand wavy. But so on the question of cost,
*  it's tough and I'll tell you why. So if you look at the International Space Station,
*  there are different estimates on what that has cost so far, but it's something like 150 to 200
*  billion dollars. Extraordinarily expensive. That's for a crew of six in a room about the size of a
*  nice apartment. So what a space advocate would say, I think correctly, is that as costs fall,
*  that will get way cheaper. But as I think Jonathan McDowell pointed out to us,
*  the modules are a huge part of that cost. It's not like launch is doing everything. Those modules
*  are very expensive. But so the thought is, you get to a world where you're actually mass producing
*  the modules for space hotels or whatever, then maybe you can really drop down the price. So we
*  talk about how, depending on how you count it, you can get a little fuzzy with the numbers,
*  but between 1957, say, and like 1970, the cost of going to space, putting stuff in orbit anyway,
*  dropped by maybe as much as 99%. It hasn't happened since. But since 2015, there are different
*  estimates, but let's say it's dropped by like three quarters. That's a pretty fast decline.
*  So what I'm saying is essentially, there are reasons to believe it will be zany expensive,
*  but scaling the rocket launch really does matter. And in ways you might not anticipate,
*  it's not just that it's cheaper to get stuff to space. It means you can use more off the shelf
*  parts because you don't have to fit it exactly in the fairing of the one vehicle you have.
*  So there is a huge amount of room for cost drops, which is part of why we got interested in this
*  topic in the first place. So I really wouldn't want to give a number, but I would say it's a
*  huge number. It might be smaller than you think. I think if the US decided tomorrow, we have to
*  have a moon base or Mars base with a thousand people, you're probably talking trillions. You're
*  talking about a zany amount of money. But in terms of the space business scaling over the next 50
*  years, there are possibilities. It's very path dependent. If Lockheed Martin said they were
*  making a compact fusion device, I don't believe them, but suppose they did. That would change
*  the equation a lot. In terms of time scales. I think time scales, it's so hard to predict
*  because it really depends on what people decide is a priority. And so if the US decided we are
*  absolutely in a space race with China, the president and everybody in the Senate agreed,
*  we threw a ton of money at it. We could maybe make that happen soonish. But I don't know. But
*  a huge part of our book is arguing that we shouldn't be doing it as fast as we can.
*  We should be stopping and first we should be doing more biology experiments to get a handle
*  on the risks so that we can reduce the ethical problems. And if you've got more time, maybe you
*  can work out a system with the international community for who gets to extract what and how
*  are those profits shared? And do you get to decide that this land belongs to a certain group of
*  people so that they don't revolt in 200 years? And can Sean Carroll eat your ice cream if he
*  shows up on the moon? Probably the most important question. Very important.
*  We would like to see this take decades. But it could be rushed.
*  One last little thought on that, which I've been thinking about recently is,
*  we said earlier the lowest bound number we'd ever found on self-sustaining settlements was 100,000.
*  And it was based on an assumption about huge developments in AI and robotics. And I kind of
*  laughed about it two years ago. And that's changed. And so it's funny, like there's still parts of
*  those proposals I'm skeptical. But you wonder about if in 20 years there's a world where we
*  have fusion figured out and you can just send robots to set everything up in advance. That
*  really does change the picture. So that's why we're very uncomfortable predicting because the
*  place from which the advance comes may be surprising. Well, I did a few months ago talk
*  to Joseph Silk, who is a very well-known cosmologist who just came out with a book
*  proposing telescopes on the moon, right? Astronomy on the moon. And there's very good science case
*  to be made for them. And he mentioned his book just came out earlier this year. He said when
*  he was writing the book, he said, you're going to need human beings to maintain the telescopes. And
*  by the time the book came out, he's like, well, yeah, maybe we could have an AI in a robot
*  maintaining the telescope. So a whole new existential risk has opened up because we're
*  going to make a city of robots, artificially intelligent robots on the moon and give them
*  high technology. What could possibly go wrong? Yeah. And I think to button that up, to me,
*  that speaks to the nature of the problem, which is like, there's a Heinlein vision and a Star Trek
*  vision. And Heinlein is a hard scrabble. We're going to do this as people. Star Trek is the world
*  has worked out. So we're doing it for aesthetic reasons. I think that's much more plausible.
*  All right. I like that. That's a wonderful place to end. Kelly and Zach Wienersmith,
*  thanks so much for being in the Wienerscape podcast. Thanks for having us. Thank you.
