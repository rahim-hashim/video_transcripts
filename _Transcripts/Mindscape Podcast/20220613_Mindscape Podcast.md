Welcome to the June 2022 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! We are inaugurating a slightly different publication schedule, in which these monthly AMA will take the place of one of the regular Monday episodes, rather than being in addition to all of them. A slight tweak that will hopefully make my obligations a little more manageable.

These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patrons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | June 2022
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcmDm0J_tiE)
*  Hello, everyone. Welcome to the June 2022 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. And as many of you know, if you're listening in contemporary
*  times mid 2022, and you're a podcast listener, you know that I am in the midst of moving
*  from the west coast to the east coast of the United States from Los Angeles to Baltimore,
*  from Caltech to Johns Hopkins. It's a lot of work moving, finding a house, packing things,
*  all sorts of things. As you grow older, you accumulate more stuff. We got to move our
*  stuff into a new place. So anyway, the point of me mentioning that is I have no amusing
*  anecdotes to begin this AMA with. I just got to like try to squeeze out time to answer
*  the actual questions that were put in front of me. So let's do that. Let's go.
*  Dan O'Neill says, Do you think that the concept of emergence could be useful in advocating
*  for abortion rights? In this case, the idea that a human being is an emergent phenomenon
*  that develops gradually through the course of gestation. To someone who believes that
*  a human person with full legal rights comes into being at the moment a sperm fertilizes
*  an egg, or at some other very early stage of pregnancy, the mother's right to privacy
*  or control of her own body will never justify what they consider to be first degree murder.
*  It seems to me that the profound question of what is and is not a human person should
*  be addressed more directly by the pro-choice movement. So when I first read the very first
*  sentence of the question here, do you think that the concept of emergence could be useful
*  in advocating for abortion rights? I was thinking this is not worth answering, but in fact,
*  this is a great question, the way that it developed. So thanks for asking this, Dan.
*  It's something that I've addressed in not quite these terms, but elsewhere in blog posts
*  and things like that. I don't think that emergence is the central issue here, but the nature
*  of what is a living being is absolutely central and emergence has something to do with that.
*  But really, the distinction here, as far as I can tell, is not so much between how exactly
*  does emergence happen or something like that, but physicalism versus some kind of dualism.
*  Do you think that human beings are collections of particles obeying the laws of nature,
*  or do you think that there is some fundamentally distinct essence that inhabits them and gives
*  them a soul or a mind or something like that? That would be the dualist perspective. And
*  of course, many religious traditions believe exactly that, many scientific traditions are
*  much more physicalist about things. It's a very hard discussion to have with people,
*  but I guess what I want to say is, I do agree that we should have the discussion. So yes,
*  is the short answer to what I take to be the spirit of your question. The way that I put
*  it in my blog posts is that ontology matters to discussions of public policy, and this
*  is exactly a case. So to step back a bit from the specifics of the abortion debate, we have
*  a way of generating laws and policies in our democratic republic that involves morality,
*  involves values. I mean, of course it does. How could it not? We try to have policies
*  that lead to good outcomes. Well, what does that mean good, right? You have to have some
*  normative component of your thought there. You have to have some way of judging what is good
*  and what is bad. That's values, that's philosophy, that's morality. And yet we disagree about
*  some very fundamental issues within the realm of morality. This is, has been, and always will be
*  the fundamental challenge of democracy. To live in a democracy, you have to, on the one hand,
*  have some common values, right? You have the people who live in the democracy have to have
*  some things in common so they can get along. But on the other hand, be willing to live with
*  disagreement about some other fundamental values and make compromises, right? That's what democracy
*  is all about. And when it comes to life and death, sometimes people are not willing to make these
*  compromises so it becomes hard. It becomes a challenge to the very notion of democracy.
*  Having said all that, so anyway, short answer is yes. I think that we, in practice, make a bunch of
*  laws based on some very vague and hand-wavy and disreputable ideas about morality. The morality
*  is there, but it's not very sophisticated. It's not very careful. And many of the ideas that we
*  have would not stand up to closer philosophical scrutiny. I would like those discussions to be at
*  a much higher level, much more sophisticated and much more informed by how we think about these
*  things at a philosophical, moral, ethical, etc. level, not to mention an ontological level.
*  But there's also the fact that I think that it's not really true that a lot of opponents of abortion
*  consistently hold this point of view. Some do, many do not. This has been pointed out many,
*  many times. If you really thought this was true, you would literally convict people of murder for
*  doing abortions. And furthermore, there's plenty of times when people miscarry or otherwise a
*  fertilized egg does not come to term as a healthy baby. And what do you do in those circumstances?
*  Furthermore, if you cared all that much, you might want to care about the lives of these children
*  after they were born, as well as before they were born, and so on and so on. There are various
*  things that, you know, it's too long a discussion to go into right now. There are various reasons
*  why people are on the anti-abortion side of things other than some principled philosophical idea about
*  dualism and the insolvent of the person at the moment of conception. That's just something to
*  keep in mind when you have these discussions. If the point is we should be more honest in our
*  discussions, that's got to be a component of it. Kyle Stevens says, can consciousness only perceive
*  a single direction of time? If I were to create a simulated world that was able to run forwards
*  and backwards in time, could a hypothetical conscious simulated observer in this world
*  perceive the direction switching? So the short answer is yes, consciousness can only perceive
*  a single direction of time. There's probably footnotes there and it becomes complicated
*  because the world only has a single direction of time. So whenever we talk about these questions,
*  we're extrapolating our knowledge beyond the actual world, which is always a dangerous thing
*  to do. But the deeper answer is you have to sit down and really think about what you mean by the
*  direction of time. So you say, you know, could a hypothetical conscious simulated observer perceive
*  the direction switching? What does it mean for the direction of time to switch? Do you mean that the
*  entropy of the entire system is going down? Because that doesn't just happen, right? I mean, there's
*  no way that in the laws of physics, if entropy has been going up for a long time, it can start
*  going down in the whole universe and then start going back up again and then start going down.
*  That's just not things that happen. So it's sort of a hypothesis contrary to fact situation. Roughly
*  speaking, our consciousness as a process through time depends on the increase of entropy. So roughly
*  speaking, if entropy were going down, according to someone's directionality in their time
*  coordinate, then consciousness would perceive the direction of lower entropy as the past,
*  and the direction of higher entropy as the future. And they would always live in that direction of
*  time. So the short version of that statement is consciousness always perceives entropy to be
*  increasing along what it calls the direction of time. But even that is not, you know, you shouldn't
*  take those statements too seriously, because there are different ways for entropy to increase
*  and decrease. If you are not a closed system, but an open system as part of a bigger system,
*  your entropy can go down without any reversal in the arrow of time. If you're a closed system
*  where entropy is going down, then you perceive the arrow of time the other way. All of which to say,
*  it's very complicated and very far outside our everyday human experience. So you just have to
*  think really carefully about what you mean by these questions. Okay, I'm going to group two
*  questions together also about the arrow of time, but they're going to bring in many worlds. So
*  Brad Malt says, could many worlds explain the arrow of time? That is, once the world has split,
*  I assume it cannot come back together. Otherwise, multiple copies of oneself would need to be merged.
*  So doesn't the proliferation of worlds in a unidirectional manner imply that time can only
*  evolve in one irreversible direction? And then Robert Rux and Drescu says, would taking the
*  many worlds interpretation seriously fix the low entropy at the Big Bang problem? After all,
*  we're just in one of the possible branches of the decay of the inflationary period, which is a
*  radioactive quantum process. There are probably countless of branches in which the entropy is high
*  and no living beings exist. We simply find ourselves in one compatible with us existing.
*  So basically an anthropic reasoning. So in both cases, the answer is no, many worlds could not
*  explain the arrow of time or the low entropy at the Big Bang, not by itself. I mean, I think that
*  many worlds is right. So whatever the right explanation is, we'll be compatible with many
*  worlds, but you can't just say many worlds, therefore an arrow of time in any simple,
*  straightforward way. Otherwise people would have said it. So to the first idea from Brad,
*  yes, it is true that the worlds branch toward the future, not the past, but that's not an
*  explanation for the arrow of time. That's because there's an arrow of time. It's because there's a
*  special initial condition that there was a small number of branches to start and they branch toward
*  the future. It's exactly the same statement as saying there was a small entropy and it grows
*  toward the future. So you need to explain why there was only one branch at early times. That's
*  the same demand of explanation that you usually have for the arrow of time. And likewise, with
*  Robert's question, could you explain the low entropy at the Big Bang? Here, it's a little
*  bit different because you're saying, well, there's many different branches. Some of them entry will
*  go up, some will go down. We'll always find ourselves in the way in a branch where entropy
*  is going up in the right way. That's true, but it doesn't work quantitatively. It doesn't work at
*  the level of actually explaining the world we observe because the entropy of our Big Bang
*  local universe was way, way, way, way lower than it needs to be for any anthropic purpose.
*  The entropy of the early universe was enormously smaller than it needs to be. And one reflection
*  of that is as it grows, as the universe expands and entropy increases, you make like a trillion
*  galaxies. So you're taking the amount of matter that was in a low entropy state is enough to make
*  a trillion galaxies, very, very roughly speaking. Why was there that much stuff in this low entropy
*  state? You know, you could have had a universe that was much, much closer to thermal equilibrium,
*  but maybe there was a fluctuation that made one galaxy rather than just a trillion, right?
*  And then you'd be plenty able to make human beings or any other kind of life form you want.
*  And such fluctuations into just one galaxy or even just one solar system or a few solar systems,
*  those are much, much, much, much more common than fluctuations into our whole universe.
*  I did write a paper, if you want to look it up with Matt Johnson and Anthony Aguirre,
*  Anthony, of course, was a former Mindscape guest, where we go into the details of what it would look
*  like to fluctuate from thermal equilibrium into a low entropy Big Bang. It's very, very unlikely.
*  You just basically wind the whole clock of the universe backwards. That's unlikely at every
*  single step along the way. So Jimmy Summer says, I've heard argued that regardless of the crisis
*  being solved, slowing progress should never be an option because there will always be more problems
*  to solve down the line that will require that continued progress to solve. For example, climate
*  change needs a solution. But in this framing, slowing down progress for the sake of reducing
*  fossil fuel use would be counterproductive in the long run. I've heard arguments like this.
*  In fact, in a slightly different context, Tyler Cowen, who was an early guest made an argument
*  like this. But no, I don't buy it at all. I mean, and part of it is just the statement being made
*  is so hopelessly vague that it's impossible to argue for it being right or wrong, right?
*  Slowing progress should never be an option. I mean, that's a rather grandiose claim. It depends,
*  right? The details matter for something like this. So I mean, I don't think it's true. But imagine
*  that climate change were so bad that it was truly an existential threat to the very existence of
*  human life, right? Maybe in the next 50 years, climate change literally wipes off every human
*  being from the face of the earth. Again, I don't think that's a realistic worry, but maybe it was.
*  And if it were, you can't say, well, let's just accelerate the rate of climate change because
*  someday we'll find an answer to it because you'll be dead before you can find an answer to it. Okay.
*  And that's a problem. I don't think that any simple minded model like this is going to get
*  you the right answer. These are complicated questions. You're gonna have to think through
*  the details a little bit more carefully. Jeffrey Sagal says, I very much enjoyed your
*  conversation with Nick Lane. At one point, you mentioned biologists thinking of natural
*  selection as a mechanism that improves things. But could natural selection be a form of the
*  second law of thermodynamics? If increased complexity of life leads to increased entropy,
*  then perhaps natural selection is nature's heuristic for increasing entropy in an ecosystem.
*  Well, short answer is no. I don't think that's quite right. But longer answer is,
*  they are related to each other. But the relationship is that, I've said this before,
*  the arrow of time, which is a result of increasing entropy, is prior to everything else, prior to
*  every process that has a directionality in time, and that includes biological evolution.
*  So biological evolution definitely has a directionality, right? We started with some
*  single-celled organisms. Now we have a rich ecosystem. That's an arrow of time. The
*  only reason why there is an arrow of time is because entropy is increasing. Therefore,
*  you know instantly that without entropy increasing, you wouldn't get biological
*  evolution and natural selection in the same way. The converse is not true. The converse doesn't
*  even make sense because you can't say, well, could you have natural selection without entropy
*  increasing? Because, well, you can't say what if you had natural selection without entropy
*  increasing because you can't. Okay? So, but the point is that entropy increasing is the first
*  thing, the important thing, the prior thing. It may or may not lead to increased complexity
*  and natural selection. Natural selection or other manifestations of complexity are one of the sets
*  of things that can happen when entropy is increasing, but it's not the only way for
*  entropy to increase. So the way to think about it is that the increasing entropy allows for the
*  possibility of natural selection, but it doesn't cause it, and it's not, you know, necessary in
*  any way for entropy increase. I'm going to group two questions together about self-identity in many
*  worlds. So Tony Runge says, if there are many worlds, is there reason to restrict the idea of
*  me to just the world I experience? Are we like a tree with many branches but only experiencing
*  one branch? And Peter Blankenheim says, you recently explained that we can map a universe
*  splitting decoherence event as spreading at the speed of light or as splitting the whole universe
*  instantly and get the same predictions. I think you said this is because the many worlds are strong
*  emergence phenomena and don't exist in fundamental physics. I also think you said that the many me's
*  in the many worlds are each a real person with a real conscience, for instance, to the extent that
*  people have real consciences. I'm not quite sure, Peter, if you mean consciousness rather than
*  conscious, conscience, but maybe you do. Anyway, these two truths suggest that my personhood,
*  knowledge of which many philosophers say is the primary and only unquestionable knowledge I have,
*  is knowledge of something that does not exist in fundamental physics. Did I get that right?
*  So that last part, yes, you got completely right. The point here is that personhood is not anywhere
*  to be found in fundamental physics. As a statement, I would agree with that. I have to disagree with a
*  couple things. The phrase strong emergence, which we'll talk about again later, is a specific
*  meaningful phrase in the philosophical context and many worlds are not strong emergent phenomena.
*  They're what are called weakly emergent phenomena. That is to say, they're just ways of describing
*  what is going on at the microscopic level. The other thing to point out is that this has nothing
*  to do with many worlds. Even if there was only one world, it would still be true that personhood is
*  a higher level emergent phenomena. When you look at the laws of physics at the fundamental
*  level, the core theory or the standard model or whatever, there's no persons in there, right?
*  They are clearly higher level emergent ways of talking about what goes on in this complex world.
*  To Tony's question, is there reason to restrict the idea of me to just the world I experience?
*  Yes, there is. It's not like a tree at all. I mean, the set of all future copies of your present you
*  is like a tree, but it's not exactly like a tree because the branches are out of contact with each
*  other. That is why you restrict the idea of you to each world. Once the other people are on other
*  branches, nothing that happens to them affects you and nothing that happens to you affects them.
*  There's literally zero sense in which those different copies of you constitute a coherent
*  physical system. They are separate, non-interacting things. They're each a person. It's not like there
*  are many copies of you and one of them is the real you. They're each many people, okay? You are
*  one and there are others who are others. That's the right way to think about it. To go back to
*  Peter's question, well, what about these philosophers who say that personhood is the primary and only
*  unquestionable knowledge I have? They're wrong. I mean, I don't think there's any unquestionable
*  knowledge that you have, but I certainly don't think that it's primary. It's certainly not primary
*  when you consider the relationship of personhood to fundamental physics. Kunal Menda says, if I want
*  to simulate a dynamical system, I would write its state derivative as a function of time and its
*  state and then integrate. I'm implicitly assuming, however, that time is an objective quantity when
*  doing this. If I understand relativity correctly, then you cannot say the universe is in some state
*  at some given time because it depends on the reference frame. I want to then know how
*  Laplace's demon would dynamically evolve the universe. Do they have to assume a reference
*  frame when doing so? Is there some invariance in the frame they could choose that makes it not
*  matter? Yeah, it's exactly that latter bit. And you don't need to be Laplace's demon to do that.
*  You can be any undergraduate doing a problem in a problem set in special relativity, right?
*  You can still, in special relativity, solve equations, or in general relativity for that
*  matter, for the evolution of the universe starting with an initial state and integrating it forward
*  in time. But there is an invariance. There's a symmetry, a relativity, if you will, that says
*  that you can choose many different possible slices of space-time on which to frame your
*  initial conditions, okay? Many different reference frames in which you could give the data that
*  Laplace's demon would need to integrate forward in time. And that's perfectly fine. There's nothing
*  in the original construction that required the way that you stated your initial data to be unique,
*  right? As long as you can state it once and for all in a way that is sufficient and necessary
*  to integrate forward and backward in time, that's all you need. And relativity is saying there are
*  many, many ways of doing that. That's fine. That shouldn't bother you at all.
*  Donathan M. Goodson says, I have questions about the familiar statement that the wave function
*  contains all the information that can be known about a particle. What makes people think it's
*  true? How confident are you in its accuracy? And how could one reconcile this statement with
*  John Bell's well-known dictum that either the wave function is given by the Schrodinger equation is
*  not everything or it is not right? Well, you know, we don't know that it's true. There are people who
*  think that maybe it's not true that the wave function contains all the information that can
*  be known. What we know is the following. If you know the wave function, you're able to make all
*  the predictions for what the particle is going to do, okay? No one has ever come up with a way
*  of making better predictions than the wave function plus the Born rule are able to give you.
*  You're allowed, therefore, to only use the wave function and to say that that contains all the
*  information because there's nothing extra that you get from imagining more information. You're
*  also allowed to imagine there is more information, but that more information is just forever hidden
*  from you. That's what people do who like Bohmian mechanics, pilot wave theories, hidden variable
*  theories, right? Personally, I don't see what is being gained by doing that, but you're allowed
*  to do it. So how confident am I? Pretty darn confident, but certainly not 100%. Finally,
*  Bell's statement about the wave function either not obeying the Schrodinger equation or not being
*  everything. Well, he was discounting many worlds. You know, in Bell's theorem, there is an axiom,
*  a postulate, a premise of the argument that says that measurement outcomes have unique values,
*  which is just not true in many worlds. In many worlds, measurement outcomes have all possible
*  values just on different worlds, so it just doesn't apply. So, I mean, basically, Bell is
*  saying assume many worlds is wrong, then many worlds is wrong. That's completely true, but
*  it doesn't mean many worlds is wrong as an argument all by itself. Dan Inch says,
*  recent global events are reminding us that nuclear weapons still exist. As I understand it,
*  these weapons were developed fairly shortly after the underlying physics word was discovered.
*  How much of a risk do you think there is that modern physics has paved the way for something
*  as bad or worse? Is there a dark matter bomb on the horizon or an Everettian bomb?
*  I think that there's very, very tiny risk, to be honest. And the reason why is because, as I talked
*  about in other contexts, fundamental physics has passed a threshold. It has passed a threshold where
*  the stuff of the world around us is accounted for by fundamental physics. The thing about nuclear
*  weapons and radioactivity and fission and fusion was they were always there. They were always
*  happening, right? Atoms are decaying in your body even before we knew about it, and the sun is fusing
*  nuclei together and making power from them. That was happening before we figured it out.
*  Okay, so what we did was we figured out something that was there all around us, and we put it to use
*  in making bombs as well as making other kinds of technology. And now, since the laws of physics
*  underlying our everyday world are completely understood, that's not happening anymore. We get
*  the stuff that is around us. There will almost certainly be more stuff, be new physics that we
*  invent. So dark matter is an example where we think that there's something there, but we don't
*  know exactly what it is. But it is very, very, very hard to imagine putting it to technological use.
*  Why? Because you can't touch it. You can't manipulate it. If you could, it would be
*  around us. It would be here on Earth, and you could find it fairly easily. Dark matter doesn't
*  interact with ordinary matter, and that's not a feature you want in a bomb. If you're going to
*  make a bomb, you want it to interact with ordinary matter in a fairly dramatic way. Likewise for
*  ever-readying quantum mechanics, it's just quantum mechanics. The predictions for the real world are
*  exactly those of quantum mechanics. So it doesn't really give you anything new. That insight doesn't
*  give you any technological handle. Of course, that could be wrong. It's possible that there is
*  something that is unanticipated, that will be a future physical understanding. And that's always
*  true. That's sort of a mindless, cheap thing to say. The non-trivial thing to appreciate is how
*  fundamental physics has passed this threshold of really understanding the world around us. And
*  therefore, the low-hanging fruit has been picked when it comes to technology. Even when it comes
*  to modern speculative technologies like high-temperature superconductors or quantum
*  computers or things like that, those are still based on known physics. They're not taking
*  advantage of new physics. So I completely think that there will be all sorts of surprising new
*  technologies. I just would not be surprised if they were not based on physics that we haven't
*  yet developed, fundamental physics that we haven't yet discovered. Bob Weinman says,
*  as I recall, Feynman had a very low opinion of philosophy. If you had the opportunity to try to
*  get him to change his mind, how would you begin? Well, I mean, the short answer here is that I
*  wouldn't. Like, I don't care. There's lots of people out there who have a low opinion of
*  philosophy. There's lots of people out there of low opinions of physics or of other things.
*  Let them live their lives as long as they're not bothering me. If they start bothering me,
*  then it's a different thing. The section of people who matter for a question like this
*  are not those who just say, I have a low opinion of X. It's those who say, I think my opinion of
*  X is low, but I'm not sure. Explain to me why I should have a better opinion. Then that's a
*  person you can talk to, right? That's a person who you can have a dialogue with. They're asking a
*  question. They're interested. Once people's minds are closed, then forget about it. Move on to more
*  greener pastures, right? I think it's a pretty easy... If you did have, if Feynman or someone said,
*  look, why do you care about this stuff? I'm sincerely interested in it. All you have to do
*  is read Feynman's books to see whole bunches of philosophy, right? It's not that hard. He might
*  also at the same time be talking out the other side of his mouth and poo poo philosophy, but he
*  was doing it all along. He wrote a book called The Character of Physical Law. How much more
*  philosophical can you get than that? He was really good at it too. If you read the Feynman
*  lectures on physics, you'll read a very clear statement of what we would now call the Boltzmann
*  brain problem, the need for low entropy initial condition near the Big Bang, which many other
*  people did not appreciate. What I would point out to him is that the people who do appreciate it now
*  do so largely, although not exclusively, but largely due to the efforts of philosophers,
*  not the efforts of physicists. There is a role for sitting and thinking carefully
*  about the underlying logical conceptual structure of your physical theories, and I don't think that's
*  a difficult case to make. Justin Bailey says, if every particle is an excitation in a quantum
*  field, can we say there are really only 12-ish fields in the universe that make up everything?
*  Well, it depends on how you count is the frustrating answer. Think about an electron.
*  I know where you're getting the 12-ish from. Just count the number of particles or whatever.
*  There's more than 12, even in the standard model, because there are six quarks and six leptons,
*  but then there's also bosons. There's the gauge bosons, and they count. Those are particles too.
*  I don't know how many there are, but there's certainly more than 12. Even if you take one
*  of them like the electron, when you say there are six leptons, one of those leptons is an electron,
*  in the usual way of talking about the standard model. But how many fields are there that you
*  need to describe an electron? You might say, well, the electron field. But the electron field has a
*  spin up component and a spin down component, or a helicity right-handed and a helicity left-handed,
*  if you want to be slightly more technical about it. There's really those two components,
*  and you can't really completely clearly distinguish the electron field from the
*  anti-electron field. When we say there are six leptons, we're grouping together particles and
*  they're anti-particles. Mathematically, the field that describes electrons comes with four components,
*  which you can think about as spinning clockwise, spinning counterclockwise,
*  electrons and positrons. Two times two is four. Likewise for quarks, they have the same kind of
*  story, except they also come in three colors. There's a whole bunch of fields, but then it
*  depends on how you count. There's no right way or wrong way of counting. When you have a vector
*  pointing in space, like the electric field, is that one field with a vector value, or is it three
*  fields because the vector has three components? Who cares is the answer. It doesn't matter.
*  But the spirit of your question is, are there only some small number of fields that make up
*  everything? Well, not everything because there could be fields that we haven't yet discovered
*  because they don't interact very strongly with the stuff that we do have in our laboratories,
*  like the dark matter. Dark matter is probably some excitation of some quantum field that we
*  just don't know which field it is yet. It might be some relatively finite number,
*  but we don't know what that number is right now. Jochem says, in the spirit of the very effective
*  method of in order to solve a problem, imagine you have already solved it and work your way backwards.
*  I would like to ask you, imagine you have fixed the climate problem. How did you do it?
*  You know, I'm not an expert on this, so you shouldn't take my recommendations or anything.
*  Well, you shouldn't take my ideas as recommendations. Let's put it that way.
*  I'm a theoretical physicist, not a climate scientist or engineer of any sort whatsoever.
*  At the level of theoretical physics where everything is a spherical cow, here's the basic problem.
*  We've had millions of years of life on Earth creating what we think of as fossil fuels,
*  right? Oil and gas and coal and stuff like that out of the biological organic materials that were
*  put underground over the course of, again, many millions of years. This is a very finite resource.
*  It's a very valuable resource because these are complex molecules, a feature of life,
*  of biological happenings, biological organisms. They create much more complex molecules than
*  inorganic processes do. There's only a finite amount of it, not just burning, but there's
*  other things you can do with these fossil fuels. You can make plastics and other materials. They're
*  crucially important for scientific research and so forth. We are literally burning them,
*  right? This very finite resource. We are literally setting a match to it and lighting it on fire.
*  I get why you have to do that early on in technological development, but we don't have
*  to do that anymore. We can save some of that resource, which is why I'm not in favor of
*  burning through it faster, which is a lot of the strategy for having fuel be cheaper and so forth.
*  Dig up more, drill more, have more pipelines that just burns through our finite supply much
*  faster. If you think, well, it's finite, but still pretty big, you're wrong. That's the traditional
*  mistake. The oceans are very big. We can't make them dirty, right? It's not really true. We can
*  do it if given a few years. I would not have any fossil fuel burned at all. If you're thinking
*  about the ultimate solution to this problem, stop burning fossil fuels. Do other things.
*  What are the other things? I don't know. Some combination of renewable energies, fusion,
*  nuclear power, whatever it is. Again, there are difficult technological engineering problems that
*  I'm not an expert on. That's a long-term solution, right? That is not a short-term solution.
*  In the short term, we have to have a path to get there from here. One simple thing is just to shift
*  from using machines that burn fossil fuels to using machines that run on electricity,
*  put a lot more technological development into batteries and electrical power generation,
*  etc. Having said all that, there's also the entirely different possibility of cleaning up
*  the atmosphere, right? If it's really climate change in particular that you care about,
*  you can imagine, again, it's easy to imagine, it's hard to build, but you can imagine all sorts of
*  either chemical or biological ways to remove hydrocarbons or whatever from the atmosphere.
*  That could very well help. I don't know what the prospects are for that. I'm again not an expert.
*  It does not solve the problem that we have a finite amount of fossil fuels here on Earth that
*  we're burning through like crazy. I'm all in favor of trying to imagine technologies and create them
*  that would clean up the atmosphere, but if we just keep burning our oil and gas and coal,
*  that will not be by itself a solution. Sid Huff says, it seems that most theoretical physicists
*  believe that gravity is fundamentally a quantum phenomenon, but no one has actually figured it out
*  fully. Is it possible that gravity cannot in fact be quantized? What would the implication be for
*  the standard model? Well, as I've said before, any question that begins, is it possible, the answer
*  is almost always yes. Sure, it's possible that gravity cannot be quantized. I mean, there's a
*  very trivial sense in which I think that gravity is not the thing that should be quantized. You
*  should have a quantum mechanical understanding of nature from which gravity emerges, but I think
*  that's not what you're pointing at. Probably what you're imagining is gravity, which we think of as
*  the curvature of space-time post-Einstein, gravity is the curvature of a classical space-time,
*  and quantum mechanical things happen within that space-time. That's what we call semi-classical
*  gravity, right? If you imagine you keep space-time classical and have quantum mechanical things going
*  on inside it. The question is, maybe is that enough? Could we get by with a purely classical
*  space-time and only have matter be quantum, but living in that classical space-time?
*  There's plenty of reasons why the answer is almost certainly not. You never know for sure,
*  in physics, that's how it goes. Some brilliant person might be able to find out how to do it,
*  but basically the answer, it doesn't seem to make sense. It doesn't seem to map onto how we think
*  about gravity working. The classic example is do a quantum mechanical experiment where you
*  split a wave function into two different pieces and use that to actually create something where
*  the wave function of something big and macroscopic with a gravitational field is literally in two
*  different places. It's easy to do in a cheap way, it's hard to do it carefully. What I mean by that
*  is I could easily just measure some spin and then move a bowling ball left or right, depending on
*  what measurement outcome I got. But then if you believe that wave functions really collapsed and
*  so forth, you wouldn't believe that the bowling ball itself was in a superposition. What you would
*  really need to do to do it completely carefully is have an experiment where the wave function of
*  the bowling ball was not interacting with the outside world, was not measured in any way,
*  and yet was separated into two different locations in space. Then measure the gravitational field of
*  the bowling ball. Where does it point? Does it point to in between where the two pieces of the
*  bowling ball in the superposition are? Or does measuring the gravitational field cause the wave
*  function to collapse in some way? Again, we don't know what the right answer would be, but the
*  rough feeling is that that whole picture doesn't make sense. All of our familiarity with gravity
*  comes from situations where the gravitating objects have specific macroscopic locations.
*  It's hard to imagine what to do if your gravitating objects didn't have large macroscopic
*  locations, specific macroscopic locations, right? If your gravity was classical, how does it respond
*  to quantum mechanical matter? Again, I'm not saying that it's impossible to imagine, but it'd be very,
*  very different than anything that we have in physics today, and it'd be hard to figure out
*  how to make it work. P. Walder says, in your recent MindChat discussion, MindChat,
*  different podcasts than Mindscape here, but I was on a MindChat with Philip Goff,
*  Keith Frankish, and Barry Lower. The question is, an issue was raised regarding whether physics
*  acts differently in the brain as compared to lab-based environments. In that discussion,
*  locality was identified as a principle that might prohibit the known laws of physics acting
*  differently within the brain, regardless of its complexity. In his solo follow-up podcast, Philip
*  insisted that he would not expect strong emergence to be present in lab-based particle experiments
*  because the environment was not a complex one, and these lab-based observations could not exclude
*  the idea that strong emergence could be present in the brain due to its inherent complexity.
*  Could you comment on this? Sure. Philip, who I've had on the podcast before, Philip Goff,
*  is a panpsychist, and he doesn't believe that physics all by itself is going to be enough to
*  explain consciousness, which is fine. I give Philip enormous credit for engaging with people
*  who disagree with him about that, but he just doesn't understand physics very well. That's
*  okay. I don't understand neuroscience very well. I don't even understand a whole bunch of philosophy
*  very well. For Philip, it's very easy to say, imagine changing the laws of physics in some
*  dramatic way that shows up inside a brain but not inside a rock or inside the Large Hadron Collider.
*  To those of us who understand physics pretty well, we appreciate how difficult that would be.
*  Again, just as I mentioned a couple of paragraphs ago, you can't say it's impossible. That's not
*  how physics works. Maybe it's possible that the behavior of an electron is different if that
*  electron is embedded in a brain versus being embedded in a rock. My point is that it is
*  completely incompatible with everything we know about physics, locality being the most obvious
*  incompatibility in the sense that the way the laws of physics work, according to the core theory of
*  contemporary physics, is that the electron field at every point in space only responds
*  to what other fields are doing at exactly the same point in space. It literally does not care
*  at all about what fields are doing elsewhere except insofar as they help determine what the
*  other fields are doing at that same point in space. That is just a bedrock feature of quantum
*  field theory. That's what quantum field theory is in some very real sense. You're perfectly
*  allowed to say, well, maybe it's not like that in a brain. Number one, there's zero motivation
*  in physics to do that. All of your motivation is from philosophical thought experiments.
*  In my mind, the fundamental physics understanding is enormously more sophisticated than the
*  philosophical thought experiments are, so I trust them much more. But the other is that as soon as
*  you, let's put it this way, it's not okay to just say, well, maybe let's be non-local. Let's just
*  violate that cherished principle of physics that is completely meaningless unless you do it, unless
*  you write down a theory. This is how physics works. You write down a model, you write down the equations
*  according to which you would modify ordinary physics to allow for this sort of non-locality.
*  And the reason why you need to do that is not just because it makes you a bit more honest,
*  but because almost inevitably when you do that, everything will break. Everything that we know
*  about how physics works will stop working like information moving faster than the speed of light.
*  If I can poke a field at one point in space and instantly have a reaction somewhere else,
*  which is what you need if you're not being local, that's information moving faster than the speed
*  of light, which could lead to all sorts of bad things like how fast does it move? Clearly you
*  violated Lorentz invariance as well. Clearly you're violating special relativity. The obvious
*  implication of that would be all sorts of experimental craziness that would be very
*  easily ruled out. But I can't tell you what that craziness is until you've written down a model.
*  So no physicist is really going to take this very seriously at all. Finally, something worth
*  noting is it gives you precisely zero progress on the hard problem of consciousness. Once you've
*  adapted the laws of physics from the local form that we know and love to some non-local form,
*  there's still laws of physics. There's still physical stuff doing its physical thing.
*  I don't see what the possible motivation for breaking all the laws of physics is
*  to make absolutely no difference to the problem that you're trying to approach. That would be my
*  answer. JM Autobot says, I'm trying to better understand how the universe has a shape.
*  I sometimes read that the universe might have pinched off a larger universe like a drop from
*  a glass of water, or that universes might be like bubbles of soap, maybe even colliding in the past.
*  Then I read how our universe seems flat by our best measurements. Can you help me understand
*  how the universe can be both bubble-like and flat, especially if it is infinite? Thanks.
*  Sure, the answer is we don't know what the shape of the universe is. It's extremely possible,
*  again we don't know, but it's extremely possible that the shape of the universe is just wildly
*  different from place to place, that it has no simple form like flat or spherical or anything
*  like that. Those are all simple ideas that you can propose and think about, but there's no empirical
*  evidence for it. The empirical evidence is that our three-dimensional space within our observable
*  universe is spatially pretty flat, okay? But we also know with very, very high confidence that
*  that's not the whole universe. The universe continues beyond what we can see because we
*  can only see back a certain time to the Big Bang, right? It's conceivable that literally just now
*  we're seeing the edge of our universe, but there's zero reason to expect that. It's much more likely
*  the universe continues on. Maybe it continues on keeping flat, that's possible. Maybe even though
*  our universe looks flat to us, the three-dimensional universe in which we live, the three-dimensional
*  space, maybe it looks flat, but just because we're only seeing a really tiny part of it,
*  just like your yard could look flat even though the earth is round, right? Maybe the universe is
*  like that and the universe looks flat to us but is curved on larger scales. Furthermore, you know,
*  all these words and whatever, bubbles and bubbles of soap colliding and so forth, these are all kind
*  of metaphorical, colorful things that people put forward. You got to be careful with what you mean.
*  These colliding bubbles that people are talking about, what is colliding is the edge of the bubble,
*  so it's very possible that our universe is inside, our three-dimensional universe is inside some
*  two-dimensional bubble which will someday collide with the boundary of another three-dimensional
*  region of space that is also a two-dimensional bubble. We have no idea. I mean, we have
*  speculations along these lines. It may or may not be true, but that's the edge. That would be the edge
*  of our region of space. That would not be the region of space itself, so keep your wits about you,
*  and be very careful when people are talking about this stuff to try to distinguish what we have
*  evidence for from what we are speculating about. It's fine to speculate. I do it all the time,
*  but be clear when you're speculating versus when you're talking about things we actually have
*  evidence for. An onion has a priority question and the priority question is in the form of
*  a poem, which I guess I will read.
*  There's a question mark at the end of that, but I have no idea what the question is, so I will take
*  my recitation of the poem as fulfilling the promise of the priority question there.
*  Thank you for your poem, onion.
*  From a spectrum of the Hamiltonian, I'm curious to how you think about time from this perspective.
*  Is it fundamental or somehow emergent? Well, the short answer is we think of time as fundamental,
*  but it's not because we have some conviction that time is fundamental. It's just because,
*  you know, one step at a time, we're trying to make sense of some very difficult problems where
*  experiment is not being much of a guide and we have to, you know, use our principles and our
*  theorizing, etc. So I'm in favor of making as few wild leaps into the unknown at a time as possible.
*  So it is completely possible in my mind that time might be emergent, not fundamental, whatever,
*  but that seems to be, according to everything I know, a different question than whether space
*  is fundamental or emergent. Quantum mechanics and quantum gravity really seem to treat
*  time and space differently. Now, obviously, our best classical theory of gravity is Einstein's
*  general theory of relativity, where space and time are combined to make space time.
*  So that is something to be kept in mind when one is trying to go from the quantum theory of gravity
*  to classical space time. But it's not any kind of immovable obstacle in the road. It's just an issue
*  you'll have to keep thinking about as the future goes, as you develop the theory more and more in
*  the future. Tim Giannitsos says, in computer science, space and time are considered two
*  resources that a computer uses to make a computation. However, the third resource is randomness.
*  No algorithm can actually manufacture its own randomness. If there is true randomness,
*  it is always mined from the physical world. Space and time are associated into a manifold
*  called space time. Are there theories that incorporate randomness somehow as another
*  component of this manifold? I think that this is an intriguing question that I don't know a simple
*  glib answer to because I'm not exactly sure what it would mean to incorporate randomness in this
*  sense. There certainly are theories of quantum mechanics, which are truly random, which think
*  of the evolution of the wave function as something that has a completely stochastic component.
*  I'm not sure what I guess I'm not sure about is the extent to which this should be considered a
*  resource because the universe is not really doing a computation. The universe doesn't have an answer
*  that we're looking for in any obvious sense, but maybe there's a role for that. I'm just not sure
*  how to analogize it to what computer scientists think about. I know that was a very unsatisfying
*  answer, but that's the best I can do. What I want to do is tackle the next couple of questions. I'm
*  going to group some other questions together because they are along a similar lines as to
*  Tim's question. It's sufficiently different. I didn't want to group it together, but with a similar
*  set of words appearing in them. Three questions to be grouped together. Roland Persson says,
*  if everything that will ever happen can be predicted by deterministic laws of physics,
*  how can entropy increase? Wouldn't it mean that everything that will happen was already encoded
*  in the initial state of the universe? I read some argument that if quantum mechanics had some truly
*  random probabilities in it, then that could be a source of actual new information that could
*  increase entropy. In this interpretation, the future would not be predictable.
*  Douglas de Young says, assuming many worlds from the point of view of Maxwell's demon is the Shannon
*  entropy, the total information content of the universe static. I imagine a universe where
*  there is a momentary state and there are laws that then process the state into subsequent states,
*  but do not increase the Shannon entropy. This somehow seems at odds with such an informationally
*  rich universe we live in. And then Rob Gryber says, does an ever writing interpretation of
*  quantum mechanics suggest that as the universe approaches an era of proton decay in the distant
*  future, there will be fewer worlds created? That is, are there fewer interactions that create
*  wave function collapses as the entropy progresses or complexity declines? Is this another way of
*  saying that as entropy increases, complexity increases, then declines? So what I take to be
*  the common thread of these questions is that the way the universe explores the space of possibilities
*  is a little bit different if the evolution of the universe has a random component to it.
*  So if you think about hypothetically, a set of laws of physics that were completely deterministic.
*  So just to answer the many worlds aspect of this, in many worlds, of course,
*  the underlying equation is the Schrodinger equation, which is completely deterministic.
*  But observers don't see deterministic evolution in many worlds. They better not, because
*  experimental evidence for quantum mechanics includes randomness, right? And that's exactly
*  what many worlds predicts. It predicts that people on branches will see what are effectively
*  random unpredictable processes, or at least processes that are predictable only up to
*  the Born Rule for the probabilities of seeing things happen. So in quantum mechanics,
*  forgetting about the fact that the wave function of the universe evolves deterministically,
*  individuals see random events. And I think that this does count as sort of giving the universe a
*  little extra oomph in terms of exploring the space of possibilities. If the universe were
*  completely deterministic, to go back to what I started saying, if there were completely
*  deterministic rules, not only for the wave function of the universe, but as seen by observers,
*  then to Douglas's question, everything that ever happened in the history of the universe
*  would be encoded in the initial state, right? The initial state would be in principle to Laplace's
*  demon, etc. able to exactly predict what happens in the future. And therefore, it has all that
*  information is in it. So if you just calculated the Shannon entropy in the most naive way,
*  it would be a constant, it would not increase because the Shannon entropy tells you how much
*  information you have about the universe. Now, none of us is Laplace's demon or Maxwell's demon,
*  or any of those demons. So we don't have that information. But in principle, it would be there.
*  When people talk about the entropy of the universe increasing, they're not talking about
*  the Shannon entropy, they're different notions of entropy, they're talking about the thermodynamic
*  entropy, or the Boltzmann entropy. That is to say, imagine the microstate of the universe,
*  there are many macroscopic configurations that have the same microstates associated with them.
*  And as time goes on, we move from macro states where there's only a small number of microstates
*  to macro states where there are large numbers of microstates associated with them. So the reason
*  why you can reconcile the increase of that kind of entropy with the constancy of the Shannon entropy
*  is that even in the current macro state of the universe, which has a larger Boltzmann or
*  thermodynamic entropy than the early time does, there is something we know about the current state
*  of the universe over and above its current macro state, namely that it came from a low entropy
*  past. That extra fact, that extra piece of information we know, tells us that the actual
*  microstate of the current universe is living in a tiny, tiny, tiny subset of all the possible
*  microstates compatible with our macroscopic information of only the current configuration.
*  Anyway, so for all intents and purposes, information is not really conserved because
*  we don't keep track of all of those things. And quantum mechanics does jiggle things around.
*  So it no longer is true in quantum mechanics that if you told me the exact initial state of the
*  universe, I would predict what observers would see in the future. Now, ultimately, to get to Rob's
*  question, they would all see the same thing because all of the worlds will eventually equilibrate.
*  The space expands, stars decay away. In the different worlds, stars and galaxies are located
*  at different places, different locations in space, but ultimately the stars go away. They fall into
*  black holes, the black holes evaporate. So ultimately they go to the same equilibrium state.
*  This is exactly the same as saying that if you put a drop of food dye in a glass of water,
*  as it is beginning to fill the glass of water, each path that it takes, if you do it many times
*  in a row, will be different. The individual swirls of complexity as the ink and the water
*  mix together will be different if you do it twice in a row, but the eventual final state is the same.
*  And so entropy increasing is exactly, to answer Rob's question, driving this initial increase
*  in complexity and then diminishment in complexity. I think I answered Roland's question just to be
*  perfectly clear about it. In some sense, there is new information there. You could imagine a
*  classical world, let's put it this way, infinity is very big. And in classical mechanics, the
*  position of a single particle is given by a real number. That's an infinite amount of information.
*  If you had 10 to the 80th atoms, like we have in our observable universe, in a classical deterministic
*  universe, you could still put an enormous amount of information into the initial state.
*  It's not that you can't fit it in there classically and you need quantum mechanics.
*  The new thing is the following. In quantum mechanics, you can imagine that the initial
*  state is truly low information. Information in the sense that it doesn't take a lot of information to
*  specify the initial state. So classically, to specify the initial state of 10 to the 80th
*  particles is exactly as easy or difficult as specifying the final state of 10 to the 80th
*  particles. That information is conserved. But in quantum mechanics, because of branching,
*  you can imagine that the initial state of the universe is very, very simple. I mean,
*  that's literally what Hartle and Hawking did when they talked about the wave function of the
*  universe. They had a really, really simple initial quantum state for the universe.
*  Then because of branching, that initial simplicity is broken up. The combination of everything is
*  simple, but the individual roots that are taken by paths are very complicated. Just as I can take a
*  very simple circular plate, a circular piece of wood, and I can cut it using a jigsaw into many
*  different complicated looking shapes. The many different complicated shapes fit together to make
*  something simple. That's exactly what many worlds does from a simple initial quantum state of the
*  universe. Gillis15 says, I read about your pending move to Baltimore. Does that mean you will no
*  longer teach at the Santa Fe Institute? Additionally, do you have a chance to tour Los Alamos? If so,
*  what did you think? I'm a native New Mexican, so it would mean the world to me if you answered these.
*  I am moving to Baltimore, but my affiliation with the Santa Fe Institute remains what it was.
*  I will not be teaching there because nobody teaches there. It is not a teaching institution.
*  It is a research institution. My official title there is fractal faculty, which means I spend
*  several weeks a year, a couple months a year at Santa Fe. I'm going to continue to do that. In fact,
*  I'm going to go in August. I will be there. I have once been to Los Alamos to give a talk with. That
*  was a long time ago, and I couldn't really tell you much about it. I love Santa Fe, love New Mexico.
*  It's a great place to visit. That's one of the reasons why I wanted this affiliation with them.
*  Ken Wolf says, for a while, I've been thinking about the utility of near-death experiences as
*  a means of advancement to new levels of sophistication. As an example, our species has
*  experienced... Blah, my talking is not very good today. As an example, our species has experienced
*  at least one near-extinction event when we were reduced to a few thousand individuals. As another,
*  the more I read about long-lived civilizations like the Roman civilization, the more their history
*  looks like a series of near-collapse experiences. My question is, have you come across anything in
*  your intellectual pursuits or your personal life that suggests a link between near-death
*  experiences and opportunities for development? Well, short answer no. If you're talking about
*  actual academic work on this subject, I would recommend not calling what you're referring to
*  near-death experiences because there's a whole community of people who study near-death experiences
*  in order to prove the existence of life after death. Actually, human beings coming close to
*  death and seeing heaven or god or their relatives or whatever. That's what most people think of when
*  you say near-death experience. So I don't think you have that in mind. I mean, of course, there is some
*  general vague feeling that nothing focuses the mind like a hanging, right? Like being in extreme
*  circumstances forces you to think in creative ways, right? If everything is comfortable,
*  if you're near equilibrium, then you can sort of get along making the same slight mistakes that
*  you've been making a long time and being in dramatic circumstances makes you think.
*  Having said that, I'm not in favor of near-collapse experiences, either as a person or as a
*  civilization. In part because of survivorship bias, right? You say things like, or we perceive
*  that, oh, you know, this person or this society or this institution went through a really bad
*  period and came out better the other side, therefore really bad periods are good for you.
*  But often really bad periods lead to you not coming out the other side, right? The risk of not
*  surviving is much more when you're near-collapse. So I think that if you were to do a cost-benefit
*  analysis, I would not be in favor of frequent near-collapse experiences. That would be my guess.
*  Joshua Hillerup says, I've just had a multi-day power outage here in Canada,
*  where lots of people in my area still don't have power. My question is, what sort of preparation
*  do you have at your home for something like that? Well, you know, my home is changing,
*  as we mentioned above. Here right now, I'm in Los Angeles, where there is a special set of
*  challenges for long-term, well, I shouldn't say long-term, rare but severe events, right?
*  Like an earthquake or a fire or something like that, mudslides, who knows, power outages.
*  So yeah, like many Los Angeles folks, Southern California folks, we have an earthquake kit
*  with food, basic medical supplies, some simple lighting and masks and warm blankets and things
*  like that. The main problem if we had a severe earthquake here in LA would be a loss of power
*  and water for some period of time. So no one ever has enough water. We do have some water,
*  but everything I've read about these things says you never have enough water because you forget how
*  much water you go through in a day. So we try to have many gallons of water, but probably not
*  enough. Yeah, so the basics. Moving to Baltimore, of course, Northeast Corridor, it's a different
*  set of worries. Earthquakes, not a major worry, but now you have hurricanes, not to mention just
*  other severe weather events. So we'll be bringing our earthquake kit with us, a lot of overlap
*  between what you need in an earthquake and what you need in a hurricane. We're not looking for
*  places right on the water, so we're hopefully not in danger of flooding, but that will depend
*  on where we live. Who knows? Joe says, if you couldn't get paid to do the various things you
*  do now, what would you do instead to earn a living? Oh wait, I'm sorry. I wanted to continue with
*  Joshua's question and say one other thing about the emergency preparations, which is that it's a
*  small personal version of a larger societal question about how to prepare for rare but extreme
*  occurrences. Everything in our training, our biology, sets us up to survive for things that
*  are likely to happen on our lifespan time scale. Things that happen once every thousand years are
*  very, very hard to plan for or prepare for, but we should. I don't have any deep thoughts about that,
*  but maybe think about it when you ask the question. We're very good at preparing for
*  things that happen every week or even every year with high probability. We're not very good at
*  planning for things that happen once every 10 years or even things that would happen once every
*  hundred years, but if they did, they'd be devastating. So I am a believer, I think this
*  was a question that was asked in an earlier AMA, but I am a believer in preparing for those kinds
*  of things and also in appreciating that it's difficult to put precisely the right amount of
*  effort into preparing for something like that. You don't want to be too alarmist about it,
*  but you don't want to ignore it either. Anyway, okay, so Joe's question was,
*  if you couldn't get paid to do the various things you do now, what would you do instead to earn a
*  living? This is a very hard question because the various things I do now are kind of multifaceted,
*  right? So everything I like doing, whether it's teaching or research or writing or speaking or
*  talking to interesting people, these are the things I like to do the most. And my current job I've
*  managed through hard work, it took me a while, but I've managed to carve out a living where I do a
*  little bit of all of those things. So I'm not sure how to interpret the question. Like if I would have
*  to give up on all of those things, I'd be in trouble. You know, if I'm not allowed to write
*  or speak or teach or do research for a living, it's not a lot that I'm both competent at and
*  could earn a living doing. I mean, I could imagine being a different kind of professor,
*  but that's probably not what you have in mind. I can also imagine just being a writer of some
*  sort, even a fiction writer. I have no way of claiming that I'd be any good at that,
*  but because I haven't really done it with any level of seriousness, but that's something I
*  could imagine doing and enjoying. Caliban Carol asks, I'm sure that's a pseudonym because I know
*  Caliban and he is not a Patreon supporter, believe me. If you were to witness a tremendously unlikely
*  event, say your cat quantum tunneling through a wall, and had no reason to doubt your mental
*  faculties, will you tell others about this experience at the risk of sounding delusional
*  or would you keep it to yourself? Well, I think that if it were a sufficiently unlikely event,
*  it would be a much more likely explanation that I miss experienced something, right? Either I was
*  hallucinating or something wrong with my brain, having a stroke or something like that. This is
*  the much higher credence that I misunderstood what was happening than literally the cat going
*  through a wall. So I would go to get a checkup or something like that. I would not just hide it and
*  keep it to myself. If it's reproducible, that's an entirely different question, right? Because
*  if something unlikely happens once, that's one thing. If something unlikely happens several
*  times in a row, then it's not really unlikely, is it? Something is making it happen and that would
*  absolutely be a reason to tell other people about it. Richard Graff says, if I assume there are
*  multiple dark matter particles, what if anything would prevent the existence of an entire dark
*  matter universe with structures similar to galaxies, solar systems, planets, and perhaps
*  even life that would still remain undetectable to us? Well, the short answer there is that it's dark,
*  the dark matter. And what we mean by that is roughly speaking that it doesn't interact or
*  it interacts only very, very weakly. If dark matter interacted strongly, even as strongly as
*  ordinary matter does, that's what we mean. We don't mean necessarily the strong interactions,
*  but if dark matter interacted with the same, with itself, with other dark matter particles,
*  with the same strength as good old ordinary electromagnetism, it would clump and form
*  structures pretty easily. But the point is that we've looked at the universe. We know more or
*  less what the dark matter distribution is, and it's not very clumpy at all. It's exactly what
*  you'd expect for what is essentially a collisionless particle. So there's good reason to think that
*  there's not a lot of interesting interactions in the dark matter sector. So there are two
*  exceptions to that. One is that people have occasionally floated the idea that dark matter
*  particles do occasionally bump into each other, and that helps explain this or that feature of
*  the large scale structure of galaxies or the satellites around ordinary galaxies and things
*  like that. So far, those ideas, although they're fascinating and would be great if they were true,
*  they haven't quite panned out. There are discrepancies out there between our theoretical
*  models of the formation of structure in the universe and what we observe. So in the podcast
*  episode with Priyad Natarajan, we talked about some of those discrepancies. The problem is that
*  mostly, not 100%, but mostly those discrepancies seem to occur in exactly the regimes where it's
*  hard to predict what the standard model would actually imply. So people have suggested changing
*  the physics of dark matter to fix those problems, but often the problems just go away when you look
*  at them more closely. So that's one caveat. The other caveat is I did once ask myself,
*  the sort of the scientific version of this question, in particular, could there be an
*  electromagnetic kind of force between the dark matter particles? So when other people do strongly
*  interacting dark matter or whatever, they really mean a short range force, right? The two dark matter
*  particles come together, scatter inelastically off of each other. Sorry, elastically off of each other.
*  They're just like billiard balls and that sort of exchanges some of their momentum. But could you
*  have a long range force between the dark matter particles? Something like electromagnetism, right?
*  Let's call it dark electromagnetism. So obviously, for the reasons I just gave, it can't be exactly
*  like electromagnetism because it would clump very easily. But remember, or for that matter,
*  particles would annihilate, like protons and antiprotons would just annihilate. If there were
*  dark particles and dark antiparticles and they were both charged, you would expect them to annihilate
*  into dark photons. But anyway, there is a free parameter in electromagnetism called the fine
*  structure constant, which has in our universe a value of about one over 137. So there's the obvious
*  possibility that you just decrease that number to make the interactions weaker, right? To make the
*  electromagnetic, the dark electromagnetic strength less noticeable than ordinary electromagnetism.
*  So I did this. I did the science paper with collaborators, Lottie Ackerman, Matthew Buckley,
*  Mark Kamienkowski. Matthew is now a faculty at Rutgers and Mark is now at Johns Hopkins,
*  where I'm going to be joining him. I will have an office down the hallway from Mark Kamienkowski.
*  And so we wrote a paper on dark matter and dark radiation, right? Dark electromagnetism.
*  And the fascinating thing to notice that we noticed is that it's easier than you think to
*  get away with having dark electromagnetism because as long as you make the dark fine
*  structure constant a little bit lower, maybe a factor of 10 smaller than the ordinary fine
*  structure constant, and you make the dark matter particles heavier than ordinary protons and
*  neutrons, the dark matter particles might be 100 or 1000 times the mass of the proton, then there
*  aren't that many dark matter particles and they don't interact that strongly with each other.
*  And as a result, they don't really annihilate because they don't bump into each other that
*  often. The annihilation rate becomes fairly small. So you can get away with it. You can get the right
*  relic abundance. It's much like a weakly interacting massive particle except rather than
*  interact through the weak interactions, it interacts through this new dark electromagnetism,
*  which is a long range force. The bad news is that long range forces have their own energy fields,
*  right? The electric field and the magnetic field in our ordinary case. So there is an instability
*  where you can make dark magnetic fields and dark magnetic fields might dramatically warp the
*  formation of large scale structure. So we finished the paper by saying that there's this big caveat
*  here that might ruin the whole idea. And we also said at the very end of the paper, you know,
*  once you've done this, so basically what we were proposing was the dark matter equivalent of
*  protons and anti protons, heavier versions of those. If you also had dark electrons and
*  dark positrons, then you could imagine dark atoms, right? And they could be electrically neutral and
*  stop the instability to make dark magnetic fields. So we mentioned that. And other people have since
*  followed up on that, including David Kaplan, another future colleague of mine, a particle
*  physicist at Johns Hopkins. So they've written papers about dark atoms. And again, interestingly,
*  there is room for that. You can imagine it happening. You got to really jump through some
*  hoops. It's not the most natural thing in the world, but you can imagine it happening. It has
*  to be more weakly interacting than ordinary matter, or you would have easily seen the dark
*  planets, dark galaxies, etc., which we don't see. But it's a possibility, even if there's no
*  strong motivation for it, it is absolutely something that is interesting and we should look at.
*  Probably not dark life forms or anything like that, because the force has to be fairly weak,
*  but I'm not completely convinced. I'm not allowed to say that. So who knows? Brendan says,
*  I'm always impressed with the vast vocabulary you articulate during your podcast. Was there
*  ever a time you focused on building up your vocabulary specifically, or did it come naturally
*  by reading papers, writing books, talking with people, listening to lectures, etc.?
*  Definitely the latter. I've never tried very hard to build up my vocabulary, but I've always loved
*  words, loved reading, loved talking. And I try to do so in a fairly conscious way. So it's not just
*  that I talk and write, but I think about talking and writing while I do it. So that just tends to
*  very naturally build up your vocabulary. I don't think my vocabulary is all that impressive,
*  honestly, but I appreciate the compliment, Brendan. Thank you. Preston Justice says,
*  if you could learn any other language instantly with native-like proficiency, but only one,
*  which would you choose and why? So I'm going to weasel out, I'm going to give you two different
*  possible answers to this one. If it were purely for reasons of personal pleasure, I think it would be
*  French, because France is the country that I love to visit the most and eat the food at and sit at
*  the cafes and have some coffee and whatever. But I don't speak a word of French, maybe 10 words.
*  I can get around, but probably not enjoy things nearly as much as I would if I were a fluent
*  speaker. If instead of personal pleasure reasons, we were thinking of sort of geopolitical import
*  reasons, then clearly you'd want to learn Mandarin, right? Or some variety of Chinese, because China is
*  an incredibly important country in the world right now, growing ever more important. And it's one that
*  I think that a lot of English speakers don't understand very well, in part because they're
*  not Chinese speakers. I think that would be really good to have more people who actually understood
*  Chinese in the world. There's a lot more Chinese people who understand English than there are
*  Americans who understand Chinese. Louis B says, I've heard it said that inside the event horizon,
*  time and space switch roles. And this is usually followed by a statement of the form inside a black
*  hole, you can know more easily, avoid traveling to the singularity, then out here you can avoid
*  traveling to tomorrow. The second statement gives a reasonably intuitive sense in which a point in
*  space becomes a bit like a point in time. But is there any analogous sense in which time becomes
*  a bit like space? Inside a black hole, can I freely move left and right in time? No, you cannot. And
*  the reason why is because the initial statement inside the event horizon time and space switch
*  roles is complete nonsense. It is entirely hilariously wrong. I know you've heard it before.
*  There's a reason why people say it and there's sort of more and less respectable reasons why
*  people say it. But the real reason why people are inspired to say it in the first place is because
*  if you start doing the most naive thing outside of a black hole, and so you set up coordinates to try
*  to describe your black hole space time, right? Mr. Short Shield did this, Carl Short Shield,
*  when he first invented the Short Shield metric for a black hole. So you have x or r, you know,
*  the radial coordinate theta and phi, r theta and phi spherical coordinates, and then you have t,
*  the time coordinate. And then you just naively without thinking very hard, extend those
*  coordinates inside the horizon of a black hole. What happens is the r coordinate becomes time like
*  and the t coordinate becomes space like. That's a true fact. But it's also a physically completely
*  irrelevant fact. It has absolutely nothing to do with time and space switching roles.
*  It's just a statement about what coordinates we put on time and space inside the event horizon.
*  The coordinate that used to be the radial coordinate in space is now the time coordinate.
*  And the time and the coordinate that used to be the time coordinate now the space coordinate,
*  but there's still space and time. If you were inside the event horizon, you wouldn't even
*  notice that you were inside the event horizon. There would be time and there would be space.
*  And you could move in space in three different directions. You move in time only in one,
*  just like always. Now the statement that the singularity is in the future, not to the left,
*  is completely true. The singularity is in the future, but that just means not that there is
*  some analogy between points in space and points in time. It just means the singularity is not a
*  point in space. It's a moment of time, full stop. Now the singularity is at r equals zero,
*  but r is a coordinate that gives you the time like direction. So r equals zero is a moment in time.
*  It's in your future. It's not at the center of a black hole. That's the the truth of it.
*  You can take that to the bank. James Brown says, priority question, I read your book,
*  Something Deeply Hidden twice and listen to it as well. My question is, what is your estimate of
*  the number of times the wave function of the universe has split or what is its estimated
*  splitting rate? So the short answer is no one has any idea. No one even has any idea whether the
*  question makes sense, because we don't know whether Hilbert space, the space of all possible quantum
*  wave functions, is infinite dimensional or finite dimensional. So forget about real numbers, actual
*  values. We don't even know if it's finite or infinite. If the Hilbert space of the
*  universe is infinite dimensional, then splitting is a continuous process. It's like asking how
*  many numbers are there between point one and point two, right? Well, there's an infinite number
*  that's still there's an infinite number between point one and point two. And there's still only
*  10th as many numbers as there are between zero and one, right? Both of those statements are true at
*  the same time. If Hilbert space is infinite dimensional, branching splitting is just happening
*  all the time. And you can't talk about how many branches there are. It's just a meaningless concept.
*  Now, if it's finite dimensional, which I think is very plausible, then there is some number,
*  which is how often it splits. But that number depends on details about quantum gravity,
*  which we have no idea about, honestly. It doesn't just depend on details of quantum gravity,
*  depends on details of how we divide up the Hilbert space of the universe into systems
*  and environments and things like that. Okay, so it's just not a very well defined question,
*  no matter how you slice it. But one way or the other, the answer is a lot.
*  It splits very, very often. Let's just put it that way. All right, I'm going to group two questions
*  together. One is from Phil who says, imagine you were handed a program by an artificial intelligence
*  that can perfectly predict any experimental outcome, not a black box, you're allowed to
*  look at the source code, but the program is so extremely low level or complicated that you can't
*  figure out how anything we see emerges over it. Would you consider physics solved at that point?
*  And then Varun Narasimhachar says, have you tried to reflect on what constitutes an explanatory or
*  satisfactory theory, even just to your own sensibilities? From any given state of science,
*  what factors determine the epistemic directions in which you continue to ask questions? So let
*  me answer Varun's question first, even though it came second. I don't know, is the short answer.
*  It's always my favorite answer here at the AMA is to say that I don't know. It's a you know it when
*  you see it kind of situation, what counts as a good explanation, what counts as a satisfactory
*  theory. However, let me say two slightly more detailed things. One is that you might not,
*  you can try ahead of time to imagine some criteria for what counts as an explanation
*  or satisfactory or whatever, but nature might not care. Okay, so it's I'm always suspicious
*  of attempts to say this is what counts as an explanation and then demand that nature live
*  up to that. Nature doesn't always work that way. And so the reality of scientific practice is much
*  more a give and take, figure it out as you go kind of thing. We're trying to understand how nature
*  works. We have some theories that are good, some are bad, and we try to make them better. And you
*  know, that's what it is. And I think that's the right thing that it should be rather than
*  deciding ahead of time on how things should be. Having said that, the other thing that I wanted
*  to say is that given the progress of science, it is still very interesting to try to be more
*  careful than we are about you know it when you see it in terms of explanatory power.
*  Some theories are more explanatory than others and in different senses than others. So this is a
*  perfectly legitimate thing to try to do within the philosophy of science. So what I'm trying to
*  argue against doing or at least you know, raise a red flag about doing is deciding ahead of time
*  what counts as explanatory. Deciding after the fact why a certain theory is explanatory is a
*  perfectly sensible thing to do. And then to Phil's question, you know, no, I would not count that
*  as explanatory at all to have a black box and consider physics solved. I've actually mentioned
*  this thought experiment myself before. What that would count as, a black box that could predict
*  any experimental outcome, that's not a theory of the universe. That's just an experiment generator,
*  right? So you can just ask it any question you want. Like if I collided two particles together
*  with a certain velocity or whatever, what would come out with what probabilities,
*  you don't need to build particle accelerators anymore. You don't need to have telescopes and
*  so forth. That's what that would be very, very useful for. But an explanation that a theoretical
*  physicist would want is a simple compact way of compressing all of those outcomes into an
*  understandable theory. And so the box would help you develop that, but it would not count as that
*  all by itself. Vincent Ohm says, should science and physics in particular always strive for
*  explaining the underlying mechanisms and inner workings of the world at different scales?
*  Is that even possible for the quantum world? Or should we just take the equations as a starting
*  point and not ask what is underlying these equations? For instance, the many worlds theory
*  is deduced from the quantum mechanics equations, but it does not explain the mechanism by which
*  the universe splits or does it. So this is related to the previous two questions. That's why I put
*  it here, but I didn't want to lump it together because many worlds absolutely does explain the
*  mechanism by which the universe splits. And I knew that was going to poke my, I don't know,
*  my pre-existing hot buttons or whatever it is. So I didn't want to lump it in with the other questions,
*  but that's the beauty. That's the whole point of many worlds is it explains everything. There's
*  no extra stuff. It's just there's a wave function. It evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.
*  When does the universe split? When quantum mechanical systems that are in a superposition
*  become entangled with their environment, aka decoherence. Okay. Now maybe what you mean is,
*  but you haven't explained why the wave function obeys the Schrodinger equation.
*  Sure. You can try to derive the Schrodinger equation from other principles. People talk
*  about that, but you've just invented those other principles. You haven't derived those principles,
*  right? So I just like to say, look, the Schrodinger equation is the equation that
*  the wave function obeys. And I'm not trying to derive it or explain it. That's the bottom
*  until we come up with a better theory than quantum mechanics. That is the postulate that we use to
*  construct this theory that we think does such a good job of fitting the data.
*  Marco Tausser says, does many worlds alter the probability you assign to there being
*  other intelligent life forms in the universe? For example, could intelligence occur many times
*  throughout the multiverse, but only once or on one planet in a typical intelligence hosting
*  universe? So yes, I think it does. And actually, maybe I should have lumped this with the previous
*  questions about the emergence of complexity and determinism and randomness, et cetera, because
*  this is precisely something where there is a difference in how you would think about what
*  happens in the universe if you believed in many worlds versus a single stochastic universe.
*  So remember, for agents who are living in the universe, living in the many worlds interpretation
*  is exactly the same as living in the Copenhagen interpretation or whatever, or hidden variables,
*  or what have you, up until the point where such theories are not completely well defined.
*  But you observe one universe with essentially random quantum outcomes. But many worlds says
*  that the whole ensemble of all the branches exists all at one time. And so I could easily imagine,
*  I don't know if it's true, but I could easily imagine that the chances of life existing on
*  any one branch of the universe of the wave function are small, maybe even very, very,
*  very small, but there's enough branches that it happens many, many times. This goes back to the
*  idea of sampling the space of possibilities, right? Quantum mechanics in many worlds with
*  its branching structure samples a very diverse space of possibilities, much bigger than any one
*  universe would be able to sample. So exactly because of that, it is completely possible
*  that life is rare in the multiverse, but nevertheless happens many times because there
*  are so many branches. Now I'm going to group a couple questions together once again, a few
*  questions actually, because this is a popular topic after the Judea Pearl podcast. Oleg Ruvinsky
*  says, in your recent excellent talk with Judea Pearl, you had an interesting disagreement on
*  entropy. You brought an example of a low entropy state as a triangle of billiard balls set up on
*  a table and of a high entropy state as all these same balls after they're hit by the cue ball.
*  Judea objected to it by saying that the difference here, the only difference here is in the eyes of
*  the beholder. We humans understand and recognize triangles, but we don't recognize the pattern
*  created by the cue ball. But that's not a substantial difference. You objected, but I'm
*  not sure I understood your argument as to why a triangle is indeed a low entropy state versus
*  some other random configuration. Okay, that's one question. Matt Rapoport says, in the Judea Pearl
*  discussion, you discuss the pool table with the balls, racking triangle, blah, blah, blah.
*  If there are X possible configurations of all the balls, isn't the probability of the triangle
*  configuration and the probability of the dispersed configuration both just one over X? I'm not clear
*  on how or why entropy has increased. SP Sheridan says, I very much enjoyed the Minescape interview
*  with Judea Pearl, but I was surprised that he was not aware of the forward arrow of time being
*  connected with increasing entropy. As even more perplexity disagreed with you on that a person
*  could tell simply by watching a movie on a billiard table if a cue ball breaking a triangle of billiard
*  balls was being run forward or backward in time. And it goes on, but it's basically the same question.
*  Francois Varchon says, in the Biggest Ideas in the Universe episode on entropy, you mentioned that what
*  we choose to be macroscopically observable is not arbitrary. We cannot see all the atoms as there
*  isn't enough information coming out in the photons. I interpret that as we cannot access all the
*  information from a given macroscopic system. Is this still true for microscopic systems like an
*  atom or a qubit? If not, how does it work? So I hope that that last question, which is a little
*  bit different, you can see how it's relating to the earlier questions. The earlier questions are
*  all about, in the billiard table example, why are we justified in saying that having all the billiard
*  balls cued up in the triangle, in the rack, all nice and neat is low entropy and having them scattered
*  around the table is high entropy. And the answer is that we perceive them differently. This is a
*  case where we put a coarse graining on the space of places the billiard balls could be. If all the
*  billiard balls are next to each other, snuggled up together, that's in a different macro state
*  than having all the billiard balls scattered around. And it works in the Boltzmannian sense
*  of thinking about this in terms of entropy. There are fewer ways to arrange the billiard balls so
*  they're all touching each other than there are ways of scattering the billiard balls around the
*  table. So you might object, well, but that's just because I think of it as different and I'm choosing
*  ahead of time to put that particular coarse graining on the set of billiard balls. And the answer is,
*  sure, you are. But guess what? Doing so gives you a handle on what's happening because the billiard
*  table is not a closed system. If you were to just walk into a room with a pool table and see that
*  all the balls have been, are sitting on the pool table in a neat little triangular array, you would
*  know that it is not just a random configuration of billiard balls. Even though that configuration
*  is just as likely as any other configuration, there is something special about that that makes
*  you think, aha, someone racked the billiard balls. And the same thing is true for much more realistic
*  systems. Of course, the billiard table is realistic. There are billiard tables in the world,
*  but it's not a great example of entropy because there's not that many balls. So you can't quite
*  see the large end limit here when there's only, whatever it is, 15 billiard balls on the table,
*  as opposed to like 10 to the 20 or 10 to the 30 particles in some macroscopic collection of matter.
*  So in the real world where we're talking about thermodynamics and real world systems,
*  the difference between having all the air molecules in one cubic centimeter in the corner of a room
*  versus having all the air molecules dispersed throughout the room is dramatic and very, very
*  noticeable. And precisely because the universe began in a very low entropy state, we nevertheless
*  do find stuff in low entropy configurations in exactly this sense of the coarse graining that you
*  and I choose to put on it. And that helps us understand the world because we can talk about
*  that and then understand why you see ice cubes melt and you don't see ice cubes unmelt. That's a
*  fact about the world that we observe and we understand it in terms of these coarse grainings
*  that we put on the world. Now, as Francois alludes to, there are reasons why we choose some coarse
*  grainings and not others. And it's more clear in the case of big thermodynamic systems than it is
*  in the case of the billiard balls because you coarse grain based on what you see. You can see
*  the ink in the water. You can see the ice cube in the glass of water, right? You can see its
*  macroscopic configuration. You can't see all the atoms. And so there's an immediate relationship
*  between our physical interaction with the system and how we choose to coarse grain it. Now, you
*  could perfectly well apply that to the billiard ball example because we have ways of thinking about
*  the billiard balls and communicating about them. If you say to someone, the billiard balls are all
*  racked and ready to be broken at the beginning of the game, you instantly know more or less precisely
*  the position of the billiard balls. I mean, some people might actually arrange them within the
*  triangle slightly differently, but up to that rearranging, you know exactly what the billiard
*  balls are doing. Whereas if someone says the billiard balls have been broken, they're scattered
*  across the table, you don't know the exact positions of all the balls. There are many,
*  many microstates that correspond to that description. So there's a real physical
*  difference and a reason why we choose to coarse grain in that way, even though you could coarse
*  grain in other ways. You could invent some weird set of locations on the table and say that I will
*  call it low entropy if the billiard balls are in exactly those locations and high entropy if
*  they're anywhere else. You could do that. It would be useless because you're never going to see the
*  billiard balls in those locations. There are good physical reasons why we choose the coarse grainings
*  that we do. Okay, Sandro Stuckey says, I've seen many explanations of Heisenberg's uncertainty
*  principle that goes something like this. To measure the position of a particle more precisely,
*  we want higher resolution, so we need to use higher frequency photons which affect the velocity
*  of a particle more because they have higher energy. Then there's a derivation of the relationship
*  between position and momentum via the relationship of frequency and energy. I know that the uncertainty
*  principle is much more general than that and that it is fundamental in quantum physics, so is the
*  above explanation wrong or is it correct but just an illustration? Well, it is correct, it is not
*  wrong, but it is not an explanation of the uncertainty principle. It is one way of thinking
*  about one of the consequences of the uncertainty principle, but the uncertainty principle itself
*  does not make any reference to measurements or observations. It certainly doesn't make any
*  reference at all to the mechanism by which we measure things. The uncertainty principle is
*  just a statement about what possible quantum states exist, not a statement about what happens
*  when we measure them. As a consequence of the uncertainty principle and the nature of quantum
*  mechanics, you can derive things like if you were to measure the variables like position and momentum,
*  there is no quantum state for which you could measure them exactly or you could predict exactly
*  what you're going to get for both such variables, position and momentum. But even if you chose never
*  to measure it, it would still be true that expressed as a superposition of positions or
*  momenta, there are no quantum states that are exactly localized in position and momentum
*  simultaneously. And in fact, the more localized any one particular state is with respect to position,
*  the less localized it is with respect to momentum and vice versa. That's the uncertainty principle
*  and it's really just a matter of choosing different coordinates. I mean the explanation
*  that I use in something deeply hidden and probably elsewhere is just think about a two-dimensional
*  plane with x and y coordinates. And I can draw a vector that points 100% in the x direction or 100%
*  in the y direction. Nothing stops me from doing that. So these would be states of definite x and y.
*  But then I can also draw coordinates on that plane that are rotated 45 degrees with respect
*  to the original ones, right? x prime and y prime. I can also draw vectors that are completely
*  oriented on the x prime direction or the y prime direction. What I can't do is draw a vector that
*  is 100% oriented on both the x and the x prime directions at the same time because they're
*  rotated with respect to each other. That is the uncertainty principle. Position and momentum are
*  just two different coordinate systems in Hilbert space and you cannot localize in them both
*  simultaneously. Paul Kent says, which bass guitar model do you own and when you do eventually find
*  the time, which other music genres or notable bass players will you look to for inspiration or
*  technique guidance? Ah, well I own an Ibanez. That is the bass that I have sitting behind me right
*  now and as I mentioned before I've not been playing it very much. You know I love a lot of bass players
*  in all sorts of different genres but I can't really in good conscience say that I'm looking
*  to them for inspiration since they are so far away from me. I'm still learning how to play scales
*  and things like that, right? You know my favorite rock bass players are Chris Squire, Jack Bruce,
*  Geddy Lee, John Entwistle is one of my absolute favorites. There's also jazz bass players,
*  Jaco Pistorius and so forth. Charles Mingus is absolutely amazing and there's a million
*  session players or lesser known people who have amazing technique who you know don't become famous
*  for one reason or another. So I don't have you know specific favorites in that. No, I do have
*  favorites. I do not have people I'm trying to emulate. Let's put it that way. Flying Waffle.
*  Oh I remember what I wanted to do. I wanted to tell you the time I got to appear on stage with
*  Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. You know this is not a spoiler alert I don't think but Flea
*  in a very adorable circumstance is one of the actors on the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series. I'm
*  not sure if that's a well-known fact but again I'm not really spoiling anything. So I recognized
*  him as soon as I saw him. You know he lives in LA like many working musicians do and I live in LA
*  and there was I'm not so sure exists but there was a program called Musique in Pasadena which
*  would put on quirky experimental musical performances for audiences and this was years ago
*  and the gimmick in this case was to have a rock bass player, a classical cello player, and a
*  theoretical physicist get up on stage and take turns interacting with each other in different
*  ways. So it was me Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Matt Heimowitz who was a cellist
*  and you know it was one of the very few times in my career of getting on stage that I really wished
*  I had just not gotten on stage at all. Not because it wasn't fun for me but because the real highlight
*  of this event was Matt Heimowitz the classical cello player and Flea the rock bass player just
*  improvising on stage together. Like every second that I was up there talking was a waste
*  of this precious opportunity honestly but I did you know I got up and told a little story about
*  Galileo with Flea improvising on the bass behind me and that was a lot of fun. You know I don't
*  think that there are any recordings of this event but I swear I'm not lying to you about it.
*  Flea is pretty awesome also he's a great bass player. Okay Flying Waffle says you mentioned that
*  an electron and a positron can be assembled into positronium something similar to a hydrogen atom
*  but then in what situations does matter and anti-matter actually annihilate? So positronium
*  annihilates you can put positrons and electrons together in an orbit but they don't last very
*  long they do annihilate for exactly this reason. Positrons and electrons combine to make a couple
*  photons but it does take some time so you calculate this is you know something that
*  if you're insufficiently lucky you might be assigned as a homework problem in a quantum
*  field theory course. Imagine that you are in the ground state of positronium what is the lifetime
*  that is to say what is the average number of seconds before they annihilate and it's a non-zero
*  number but it's a very short number positronium doesn't last very long. The Neuropean says you
*  occasionally put ads into the free podcast episodes could you give us some background
*  as to how this came about? Do you just select from individual offers you get in your inbox or
*  do you reach out to brands you like? Is there a lot of freedom in how you phrase the ad? Are
*  you happy with adding the occasional ad so far or does it not make out that much of an impact
*  compared to Patreon? So actually yeah you know the Patreon itself came about at the same time as the
*  ads so once the podcast came into existence I was reached out to by an agent who said you know I
*  would like to sell your podcast to a podcast network who will put ads on it and we can all make
*  money and that happened and I joined Wondery. Wondery is my podcast network. Wondery mostly
*  does narrative kinds of podcasts that they will eventually work into tv shows so I am not that
*  there's never going to be a mindscape tv show but basically what Wondery does is sell ads that we
*  put in the podcast and once that started you know I thought it would always be a good idea
*  to allow listeners if they wanted to to have ad free versions of the podcast so that's why I
*  created the Patreon in the first place. In the early days of the podcast there wasn't any
*  and so the Patreon came into existence as a way to get the podcast without ads and it's taken on
*  a life of its own for very good reasons which is wonderful. I still don't make as much cash from the
*  Patreon as I do from selling the ads so the ads are a bigger income stream than the Patreon is.
*  They're comparable same order of magnitude but the ads are definitely bigger. I'm generally pretty
*  happy with it you know one of the things about the contract that I have with Wondery is I can
*  refuse any ads any advertiser that I want and you'd be shocked at how many advertisers I refuse to
*  advertise not because they're evil or bad or whatever but there's a huge number of companies
*  that want to advertise health products okay so whether it's you know diet supplements or whatever
*  and I just can't as a scientist be seen to be endorsing these if I don't understand them right
*  I don't understand any health products whatsoever you know as at a professional level
*  so that's a huge part of the podcast ad ecosystem and I just don't participate in it at all but
*  that's okay you know I'd rather only have ads for things that I believe in so even things that are
*  not health endorsed or you know health related which I think I can't you know if it's a you know
*  here is a suitcase company okay I will even if I'm not familiar with the suitcase I will check out
*  online are they reputable you know do they get good reviews things like that and if they seem
*  to be a scam or not reputable then I won't do it and I've turned down advertisers for that reason
*  also and finally when it comes to the script I mean they generally give you a script and you read it
*  in fact they would like it if I improvised more if you know I acted like this was just my own
*  words but you know I would I'm just there's not a lot of time in the day and so I'm very happy if
*  they give me a script just to read the script so I look for some sort of compromise there because
*  I do typically they ask that you experience the product so like when I when I talk about kitty
*  litter or coffee or whatever on the podcast I have drunk that coffee I have given that kitty litter to
*  put in the cat box for Ariel and Caliban I've tried it out and I can say in good conscience that
*  it is worth doing so I do have some personal experience with essentially all these things
*  that I am that I am advertising so I'm perfectly happy with the advertising you know if people
*  don't want it they can join Patreon right and nevertheless a huge fraction of the people who
*  listen to the podcast listen to the ad version they do not come onto Patreon so that's the choice
*  they're making which is great anonymous says there are good ways to carve reality into objects like
*  Jupiter in Air Force One and bad ways like an object parts of Jupiter and bits of Air Force One
*  are there physicsy ways to think about how I choose a good ontology like am I using labels
*  to minimize the Lyapunov exponent for my measurements or maximizing information conservation
*  or something mathy like that well this is a great question and a crucially important question right
*  I mean this is basically the question of emergence how do you carve things that are made of atoms or
*  quantum fields or whatever into large macroscopic objects in useful ways and I think everyone agrees
*  roughly on the the the point of this kind of carving which is that you carve nature into ways
*  such that when all the information you have is information about the chunks into which you
*  carved it you are left with the ability to say something interesting to make a prediction for
*  the future or to understand what's going to happen next or anything like that so you look for you know
*  the finest grained ways you can chop things up and yet maintain some ability to characterize the system
*  in a small number of bits while yet predicting what's going to happen next maybe up to some
*  probabilities or something like that but that's the general idea however taking this general rough
*  idea and making it precise turns out to be really hard especially when there's incomplete
*  information about the underlying system so like one obvious example that I always like to remember
*  because it's so obvious people can actually understand it is the center of mass of a celestial
*  object right we can track the motion of the moon and the earth and the solar system without tracking
*  the positions of all of their atoms and molecules and that's still deterministic right not only do
*  you know what the earth will do but you know it deterministically and Isaac Newton was able to
*  do this and we can predict eclipses and things like that far far in the future very often that's
*  not going to be the case if the higher level systems are something like a person or for that
*  matter a volcano or a hurricane maybe the best we can do is some probabilistic predictions and then
*  you get into a whole different set of questions about how do you minimize uncertainties given
*  these probabilities etc so I chose this question for answering because I literally am doing this
*  as a research program and this is not something I've made a lot of progress on but I'm very very
*  interested in reading what other people have done and trying to make my own little contributions to
*  it what is the general theory of what emerges from what how do you carve microscopic things into
*  macroscopic things I think that there is no general answer to that that I know of right now
*  people have suggested things I mean we did a whole podcast with anil sef on more or less exactly
*  that but only in a pretty restricted domain of possibilities so I think the general questions
*  are still very very open Justin Wolcott says do you think there's any benefit for the average
*  person to spend more than say 30 minutes a week on current events news like cnn fox news msnbc etc
*  the news this week is particularly sad in America I feel like I can't change anything other than by
*  voting which I would have done even if I didn't watch three hours of CNN and New York Times every
*  day so why not save some time and do something else I think this is actually a very important
*  interesting question it's a subtle one it's difficult one because it's easy to say that all
*  the citizens who do their voting should be well informed etc but you have to be a little bit more
*  specific about to what end you're being informed one little footnote to the question is there are
*  things you can do other than voting you can convince other people to vote right you can
*  persuade other people you can lobby your existing representatives and those things also have an
*  effect so it's not just you particularly voting and when those things happen when you're talking
*  to other people around you or when you're lobbying your representatives maybe it does matter that
*  you're hyper informed about a particular issue you know you come off as more credible and
*  knowledgeable however I get the focus of the question because we're in a very polarized
*  society right now you know go back to the podcast we did with Will Wilkinson and Ezra Klein
*  analyzing just the fact that the you know polarization doesn't mean that people are
*  different from each other it means that their differences align so that in the political
*  situation in the United States right now people who agree or disagree about a certain issue are
*  more likely than ever before to agree and disagree about other issues and that makes it harder to find
*  overlap but easier to realize well this candidate is closer to me than this other candidate right
*  and so I think that we're in a situation right now where it you don't need to be hyper educated
*  about current events to figure out that one candidate is closer to your interest than another one is
*  for better or for worse right so I do think that there is a sort of pragmatic kind of at least in
*  this current moment argument to say you need to be up enough on current events that you can pick
*  you know are you Republican or Democrat roughly speaking and that's just not that hard and once
*  that happens you know who to vote for and the extra information is maybe interesting and so
*  forth but doesn't actually affect who you vote for so again I would I would put the reasons to
*  become better informed not these days as feeding into who you vote for because that's kind of
*  just too obvious in our present system unless you're really right in between which is a rare
*  but existent species but there's also other things there's talking about the issues there's
*  thinking them through talking with your representatives writing letters writing emails joining campaigns
*  you know deciding when something is significant enough that you would march or donate money to
*  an interest group or whatever so it's for those reasons not for voting reasons that I do think it
*  is worthwhile becoming informed about what's going on.
*  Casey Mahone says have you ever been through a bad breakup and how did you get over it?
*  Yeah I have I'd like to think that almost everyone has right it once you reach a certain age you know
*  some people are lucky they marry their high school sweetheart and it works out for their lives most
*  people in the modern world aren't like that there are breakups and sometimes the breakups are bad
*  yeah that happens and bad doesn't mean you know you're throwing plates at each other or whatever
*  it might just mean that it's sad that you're breaking up for whatever reason I mean maybe
*  it's sad for one person and not sad for the other person. I don't have any great advice I don't think
*  there's any magic bullet here through getting over those things the only kind of marginally
*  relevant factoid I will pass along is I once heard a talk by Philip Zimbardo who is a psychologist
*  who's kind of infamous for the Stanford prison experiment but later in life he's been thinking
*  about the psychology of people's attitude towards time and you know he talked actually about the
*  marshmallow experiment the marshmallow test which was not his he was not the one it was Walter
*  Walter Mitchell who did that first but Zimbardo was trying to argue that one of the things that
*  is revealed by the marshmallow test where you're giving either one you're giving two marshmallows
*  sorry what is it you're giving one marshmallow you're a kid you're like eight years old or
*  whatever and you're told either you eat the marshmallow now when I leave the room or if you
*  don't eat it I will give you two marshmallows and the point is supposed to be that this reveals an
*  orientation of the person toward time there are future oriented people present oriented people
*  and past oriented people okay and of course this is a wild exaggeration but there is supposed to be
*  some effect there there's supposed to be some continuum on which people lie and Zimbardo's claim
*  is that you can test for this are people more future-oriented past-oriented present-oriented
*  and it's a more robust psychological characterization than almost any other one you can find it's a very
*  basic fundamental feature of who people are and to that extent I am a future-oriented person this
*  helps me out getting over the bad breakups to get back to Casey's question I really do care about
*  what comes next you know the bad breakups for me are the ones where I can't get over thinking that
*  maybe we'll get back together right if it just is over then I have relatively little trouble moving
*  on to the next thing and it's not that being future-oriented is better intrinsically or more
*  ethical or moral or self-actualized or whatever than being past or present oriented it's just that
*  it gives you a slightly different perspective that I think helps you get over dwelling on the
*  bad things that have happened you're always getting excited or or depressed depending on
*  the situation about what is going to happen next so maybe the teensy bit of advice would be to sort
*  of cultivate a future-oriented perspective in those situations think about what's going to happen what
*  your next thing will be how to make that come about what are the things you can do to affect
*  the future that's something that I've always been very fortunate that I have had as an attitude which
*  is I don't want to just say things are bad I want to ask how can I make them better if if we're just
*  sitting around talking about how terrible things are I'm completely uninterested what are the things
*  we can do to change it that's what I want to know and that's I sort of drifted off into more global
*  issues but I think that works for romantic entanglements as well noble gas says your
*  conversation with nick lane and others offers hope that we will soon have a plausible understanding
*  of the origins of life on earth your conversation with the neil seth and others offers hope that we
*  will at some point understand the origins and emergence of phenomenal phenomenal consciousness
*  I see no hope for potentially understanding the origin of the universe you've suggested that maybe
*  we just have to accept a list of brute facts for that question given the progress we've made on
*  other hard questions doesn't that seem like a cop-out do you truly not think we will be able to
*  do better than a list of brute facts to truly understand the origin of our universe well no I'm
*  someone who definitely believes we are making progress on understanding the origin of the
*  universe that's absolutely something to do and simultaneously there will be involved in that at
*  some point a list of brute facts just like for our understanding of life or consciousness you know you
*  try to explain the origin of life but you take as brute facts all of chemistry right you don't need
*  to say well until I understand the periodic table the elements I don't understand the origin of life
*  there's some facts you just take as given and you might say well that's left for physics or
*  chemistry to explain right but that's going to bottom out somewhere there is more than one
*  possible world there's more than one way the world could have been and in some sense there
*  might be something special about our world but even if there is something special about our world
*  it doesn't explain why the world is that way it's just a fact about our world and you know we're in
*  our everyday lives we often don't want to just accept brute facts we think that there's always
*  a deeper explanation but you can't extend that kind of reasoning about our everyday lives
*  to big fundamental questions about the universe I am someone who literally believes it is impossible
*  to imagine that there aren't brute facts about the universe precisely because there are other
*  ways things could have been and there's just a fact that things are this way rather than other way
*  the that doesn't mean we have to just stop thinking about it because we're not sure what those
*  brute facts are we can always try to hope for a better explanation than what we currently have
*  that's what we do as scientists and philosophers Patricia Paulson says I get the impression you
*  aren't thrilled about loop quantum gravity I'm just a math-deficient layperson but it just seems
*  to make sense the smallest distance doesn't seem any different than discrete jumps in an electron's
*  orbit or energy or strings only vibrating in specified ways with nothing in between wouldn't
*  that be a type of symmetry so while it is just my math stupid self saying it makes sense what are
*  your objections or what are the objections others have is it all in the math well I think that these
*  are perfectly good reasons motivations to think about loop quantum gravity you know this is how
*  science works how physics works you have an idea you develop that idea into a rigorous theory and
*  then you compare that to how the world works in in direct or indirect ways so yeah you can say
*  well maybe there's sort of a discreteness in space time it's a very very natural thing to say
*  but that's not the end of your project that's the beginning you say okay what does that mean
*  mathematically what predictions does it make and so forth does the theory make internal sense is
*  it coherent is it consistent and things like that and I think that you know for all those questions
*  loop quantum gravity has just not worked there you go like I'm not against the idea of trying it it
*  was a great thing to try but it's clearly missing some important aspects of how gravity works in
*  the real world the most obvious one are the non-local aspects of gravity the aspects that
*  show up in holography and complementarity and black hole information these are all things that
*  were understood first outside the context of loop quantum gravity I mean there's no puzzle or
*  feature that seems to be universal about gravity as far as I know that was first brought up or
*  discovered in the context of loop quantum gravity they've discovered things that are
*  supposedly true in the context of their theory which is great but I think that the arguments
*  for things like holography are robust enough that they should be true in any theory of quantum
*  gravity and this idea that you just put degrees of freedom at local positions in space is exactly not
*  holographic that's exactly not you know set up to be compatible with that fact about the gravitational
*  universe so you know maybe they just haven't gotten there yet it's always possible but that's
*  just true again for all of physics when there's lots of different theories on the floor and you
*  need to pick which one you're looking at you know all of them are possible maybe they could
*  be developed with smarter people doing really good work into something that fits the data
*  but you have to choose what seems more promising than others and it seems to me that the basic
*  first moves of loop quantum gravity are not the moves to make as far as we understand in other
*  things that we've learned about loop about quantum gravity more generally Michael Lesniak says I'm
*  really interested to hear your take on the movie Tenet and how it portrays entropy as a means to
*  time travel does it hold together and does having to breathe backward air even make any sense so the
*  short answer is no it makes no sense at all it's completely movie fiction it's fantasy it's not
*  science fiction it's sort of inspired by you know various scientific ideas about entropy and the
*  arrow of time and things like that but there's no real science to what happens in Tenet is the is
*  the short answer and that's okay you know I haven't seen the movie in a while so I can't tell you
*  details but I can enjoy the movie as a movie it's it's as realistic as you know the fast and furious
*  franchise in many ways there's a lot of things that are not very realistic there but still enjoy
*  the movie that's okay Moshe Fader says I recently completed a house hunt that took roughly a year
*  so I'm curious about what sort of house you and Jennifer are shopping for in the Baltimore area
*  do you have a target size in mind if you prefer modern or traditional architecture yeah well these
*  are all very relevant questions to my brain right now I'm thinking about them every single day
*  we still have not found a house that we've settled down on but with the internet these days it's kind
*  of amazing you know we can do a lot of house hunting from California even if we're hunting
*  for houses in Baltimore they put a lot of information online which is very very helpful
*  but there's nothing quite like stepping into the house and you know feeling it and smelling it and
*  looking at the sight lines and imagining where your sofa will be and all those questions so the nice
*  thing about Baltimore is that real estate is way more affordable than it is in Los Angeles you know
*  Los Angeles is cheaper than a couple of other cities the United States maybe New York San
*  Francisco Boston but still pretty expensive by any ordinary stretch of the imagination
*  so when we sell our house here we will be able to buy a house that is much larger in Baltimore
*  now there's two sort of basic modes you can get kind of a townhouse downtown maybe close to the
*  waterfront or something like that those are very very nice very beautiful there's a big selection
*  and there are also you know big older houses a lot of hundred-year-old houses there's there's
*  sort of a building boom in Baltimore a hundred years ago especially near the campus near Hopkins
*  and so I think we're leaning in the latter direction I mean I think that if we had
*  infinite money and could pick houses anywhere in the world and build our own from scratch we would
*  go very modern in terms of architecture very contemporary but given what exists I think there
*  are beautiful colonials that are you know a 15-minute walk from campus that are surrounded by
*  leafy nice neighborhoods that you know would be great with lots of square feet so probably
*  something like that Jennifer is very energized to you know renovate a kitchen tear out some floors
*  replace them with better flooring things like that so I can't that's just sounds exhausting to me but
*  I think that we'll work out something you know it's both exciting and nerve-wracking at the same
*  time right it's a big thing we expect to live there for a long number of years and so you want
*  to choose right from the start we'll probably move there into an apartment for a little while
*  since we haven't found the perfect place yet and then keep hunting for houses in the months to come
*  Rue Phillips says I've heard you allude to the fact that you are now working on quantum gravity
*  research did I hear you correctly what are you hoping to accomplish in that field in the near
*  term the next two years so yeah I am I am doing quantum gravity I've even done a there's a whole
*  solo podcast on it from early days that about the emergence of space time from quantum mechanics
*  which is a kind of quantum gravity and you know by the way you don't need to wonder about these
*  things you can just look for any scientist what they're working on by looking at what papers
*  they've written you can go to google scholar for example there's various other more specialized
*  lists of publications that you can find online but google scholar has a pretty good coverage
*  overall in all fields it's a little bit difficult because you know there are other people named
*  Sean Carroll like previous mindscape guests who are biologists and so forth but if you put in the
*  middle initial you can find my publications very easily and just you know search by date you know
*  sort by date and then you'll find out what I've been working on lately what do I hope to accomplish
*  the next two years is almost impossible to answer because in theoretical physics you do what can be
*  what yeah you do what can be done right so there are many things I would like to do but within this
*  idea that we have of starting with a finite dimensional quantum system and seeing how space
*  time can emerge there's a number of obvious questions to ask about the emergence of Lorentz
*  invariance the emergence of quantum fields whether or not the metric that you can define
*  using entanglement is physically the metric that is felt by propagating particles and
*  fields in that geometry things like that so there's a whole bunch of things you know the
*  particular angle I have is very new and immature compared to something like loop quantum gravity
*  or string theory or causal set theory or whatever so many of the very basic questions haven't been
*  answered which always means that as I as I always want to emphasize the whole thing could crash
*  and burn very quickly could just not work you know you don't know but we're trying I think that
*  it's optimistic that we're going to make some progress progress has certainly definitely been
*  slowed by the fact that I'm moving from Caltech to Hopkins and therefore at the moment I have no
*  students or postdocs working with me so you know my publication rate is going to be smaller this
*  year and next year but I'm hoping to ramp that back up once I get to Baltimore John sorry Rob
*  Patro says you recently had a nice thread on Twitter about determinism and free will
*  it spurred a nice follow-up thread on what it means for a system to be deterministic my question is
*  is our best model of the universe deterministic despite quantum mechanics perhaps I don't know
*  which of the many worlds holds my future but it would seem the entire tree or directed acyclic
*  graph of the universe is entirely determined including the probability amplitudes of each
*  branch so there's two senses here one is that in many worlds the wave function of the universe
*  evolves deterministically as we've already said that is true but that's irrelevant to observers
*  you don't care about that because you only live on one branch at a time okay so to you there's a
*  probability distribution and that doesn't count as being deterministic so if all you can predict
*  about the future are the probabilities of certain events that that's great that's a huge
*  accomplishment scientifically but it does not count to saying that the world is deterministic
*  just because the probability distribution evolves deterministically doesn't mean the world does so
*  even so once you take quantum mechanics into account I think that the right thing to say
*  is that our world the world that we observe is just not deterministic for all intents and purposes
*  Paul Hess says in your interview with Sean B. Carroll just mentioned the idea was raised that
*  the mutation rate of organisms is in theory adjustable if you could adjust the human mutation
*  rate would you increase it greatly in response to the much more rapid changes in climate and
*  technology we are facing or reduce it greatly to provide a stable base for adaptation using
*  technology our race is going through non-biological evolution well I particularly my individual self
*  would not mess with the human mutation rate and that's because you know it's it's more or less
*  not not precisely because there are things that we can't control but biology has tuned that
*  mutation rate to be just about right if the mutation rate is larger remember most mutations
*  are bad okay most mutations kill you or at least harm you in some way because we're pretty close
*  to optimized given the general features that we have as biological organisms not just human beings
*  but all mature species are like that if you slow it down the mutation rate then it is harder to make
*  uh even more progress biologically so it's probably about right now you are pointing out correctly
*  that we are living in a time when our conditions are changing more rapidly than usual so this
*  mutation rate that has been selected or controlled by natural selection is meant for a time when
*  changes are slower that's true but you all like you also say there are ways that we can adapt to
*  our changing circumstances that are not through changing our genomes through non-biological or
*  technological changes so I think that I would be cautious in this particular way you know there's
*  also the question of individual um not rights but individual welfare versus group welfare right if
*  you increase the mutation rate in human beings by any noticeable amount you would get a lot more sick
*  babies and those individuals would suffer even if occasionally some of them would adapt in a positive
*  way and so the question is you know how many people do you want to suffer just to make some
*  that are doing better and I'm not in favor of really increasing that number by a great amount
*  Igor Parshkin says my question is about the equality sign in mathematics I always imagined
*  to myself it means that two sides of the equation are completely equivalent i.e. f equals ma is
*  saying that the force is acceleration just with a proportionality constant they're the same thing
*  just in different words but I recently recently realized that this does not always hold for
*  example the Schrodinger equation says h psi equals e psi it doesn't mean that using an
*  operator is the same thing as energy so in short what does equality mean in math so I think there's
*  a few things going on that I need to clear up here one is that the Schrodinger equation does not say
*  h psi equals e psi that is the time independent Schrodinger equation which is just a special case
*  of the real Schrodinger equation the real Schrodinger equation says h psi equals i d by dt psi the
*  time derivative of psi okay so that's a much more general thing from which you can derive
*  the equation that you wrote down the other thing is that you're asking about what equality means
*  in math but your examples are all what equality means in physics which are different things you
*  know equality doesn't mean identity it doesn't mean that two things are defined to be the same
*  so you give f equals ma as an example but think about the inverse square law for gravity
*  right the force of gravity is g newton's constant times the mass of one the mass of the other
*  divided by r squared that's not supposed to be telling you that the force is that one over r
*  squared thing times the masses it's numerically equal to it but it's conceptually a different
*  thing that's what's going on in the Schrodinger equation and it's even much more obvious in
*  einstein's equation for general relativity in general relativity you have r mu nu minus one
*  half r g mu nu on the left hand side and even if you don't know what those symbols mean what
*  they're telling you is the curvature of spacetime okay and on the right hand side you have eight pi
*  g t mu nu which is telling you the energy and momentum in spacetime conceptually two completely
*  different things the equation is just telling you they are numerically equal in solutions to
*  einstein's equations in other words in classical spacetimes in the real world so that's always the
*  way you should think about it in physics in a physics an equation is telling you the two
*  differently defined quantities are numerically equal to each other in math it can mean lots
*  of different things because math is not about a substance right math is not about an individual
*  domain of applicability math is more general than that math is about syntax more than semantics if
*  you want to put it that way it's about the symbols more than their meaning they the same symbols can
*  mean different things but two plus two equals four whether the two things and the four things
*  are apples or oranges or whatever okay so it's a slightly different meaning in math and in physics
*  but in neither case is equality supposed to mean these two things are the same concepts it just
*  means they're numerically equal alexandro del rincon says according to general relativity mass
*  and energy warp spacetime i'm not sure this is a sensible question but why is there an interaction
*  between the two or some sort of friction that causes the warping well you know this is dangerously
*  close to the kind of question that the answer is it just is that way right i mean that's the equation
*  that's what the theory says the theory postulates that mass and energy warp spacetime but as i said
*  above you know sometimes you can kind of try to derive equations like that through some other
*  principles but you're just replacing one set of postulates for another so you're you're welcome
*  to just postulate einstein's equation of general relativity and say this is the one of the postulates
*  of the theory nothing wrong with that in that case it just is true but you can also derive it from
*  some other set of postulates for example the principle of least action the principle of least
*  action says that along physical trajectories if you imagine the space of all possible trajectories
*  for a system which in general relativity means the space of all possible spacetimes between some
*  initial configuration and some final configuration and then you can calculate a number called the
*  action for all of those trajectories or all of those spacetimes and what you find is that the
*  one that is actually a solution to the equation the motion is the one that has the minimum value
*  of the action and this makes perfect sense when it's a simple system like a ball rolling down a
*  hill where the action is an integral over time of the kinetic energy minus the potential energy so
*  it's not the the total energy which is just constant along the trajectory but it's basically
*  some kind of competition between kinetic energy and potential energy so you're trying to minimize
*  kinetic energy minus potential energy along a path between two points and you might say well
*  good so just minimize the potential energy is always positive and the kinetic energy is always
*  positive by themselves let's say that you've set things up that way and you want to minimize
*  kinetic minus potential that means go to very large values of the potential and very small
*  values of the kinetic energy right the problem is you have a boundary condition you just start
*  somewhere and end somewhere and you set up your initial condition so you start at some place at
*  some time and you end at some other place at some other time and subject to those constraints you
*  want to minimize the kinetic energy minus the potential energy which sort of means roughly
*  speaking you go as slow as you can to get to where you want to go in the right amount of time you
*  don't just speed really fast and get there and sit there that's not the solution to the equations of
*  motion so in general relativity translating those words into the context of curved space time says
*  that there's a balance there's a trade-off just like versus kinetic and potential energy there's a
*  balance or a trade-off between the amount of stuff in the universe and the curvature of space time
*  so space time curves as little as it can to adapt to the amount of energy that it has in it to
*  minimize the action there in some sense that's no better than just postulating the final answer
*  because well why is that action the one that is minimized by these trajectories right but you know
*  this is how the world works the world is full of fields like the gravitational field they all move
*  and vibrate and oscillate and they all interact with each other in one way or another the stuff
*  in the universe that makes up matter interacts with the stuff that makes up space time and that's
*  gives us the equation that we have at the end of the day obdi ayow says with all the craziness and
*  madness going on in the world right now do you think one day in the future hopefully soon
*  the james webb space telescope will find something that blows people's minds and brings humanity
*  closer for the purpose of advancing humanity civilization so there's two there's a good
*  question two levels of answer here one is is the webb space telescope going to find amazing things
*  and the other is will that bring humanity closer together you know in the latter question honestly
*  i don't think so by any reasonable amount you know the kinds of things that historically
*  have ended wars or induced world peace are not scientific discoveries as far as i can tell
*  they are there they do play some role you know science is part of the legacy of all of humanity
*  doesn't belong to any one person or country or anything like that and everyone can be impressed
*  in wonder at a great scientific discovery but empirically the the effect of that on human
*  behavior is is pretty small the other is you know will the webb space telescope make these
*  world-shattering discoveries you know i don't know it will certainly make big discoveries
*  because they're sort of targets you know the thing about building a new telescope or a new
*  scientific experiment is you can't predict what you're going to see otherwise if you knew what
*  you're going to see you wouldn't build it you would save the money so you're looking into the
*  unknown a little bit and that's part of the excitement however you can't get money from
*  nasa or congress without giving good expectations that you're going to see something interesting
*  so for the web uh there's two obvious targets here one is galaxies in the early universe the early
*  the very early formation of stars and galaxies right because the the web is is focused on
*  infrared radiation so unlike the hubble space telescope which was looking at visible light
*  jwst is looking at longer wavelengths and one of the reasons why that's interesting is because
*  if you have a galaxy that is very early that is just like our galaxy mostly giving off radiation
*  in the visible spectrum once it gets to us it's redshifted to the infrared so you're you have
*  optimized yourself to look further back in time if you build an infrared telescope like jwst so
*  that's interesting um but it will mostly be interesting to astronomers and cosmologists
*  right we know that galaxies exist understanding how they are assembled and understanding how stars
*  light up is very very interesting but it won't be a complete world shattering shock the other thing
*  that jwst that i know about that it's going to look for are exoplanets and features of exoplanets
*  planets around other star systems so that is is very exciting we know less in some sense about
*  exoplanets than we know about other galaxies we found thousands of exoplanets and trillions of
*  galaxies so or you know millions of galaxies anyway that we've actually found um so that has
*  for obvious reasons that i don't need to delineate here the prospect of being really really exciting
*  if everything goes well probably we'll just get an inventory of exoplanets right um but we could get
*  more interesting things as well you know that's something to hold out hope for matt lane says do
*  we need more academics to get involved in and run for political office what could we do to support
*  a higher level of education and discourse in our politics well i think that there are some academics
*  who would be great running for political office and some have successfully um many academics would
*  be terrible at politics i don't think there's any intrinsic connection between being an academic and
*  being good at politics you know in the modern world for better or for worse the job of being
*  a politician a lot of it is either fundraising or negotiating with your fellow politicians right those
*  are the things it's not about just having the right policy prescriptions it's about getting things
*  done with those policy prescriptions so and i think that a lot of people you know fall in love
*  with this or that politician because they say the right things but personally i want to know what
*  they've gotten done what legislation have they gotten passed or what reforms have they accomplished
*  or or whatever that's another level of trickiness and again one that academics are not themselves
*  especially good at um but the you know this is related to the second half of your question is
*  should we have a higher level of education and discourse that's an easier one yes i think that
*  we should you know in many ways our our current political system here in the united states and i
*  think also elsewhere it's a little weird you know someone was pointing out the ages of the people
*  who wrote the constitution of the united states a lot of them a lot of the people you know that both
*  the continental congress that did the declaration of independence and then also at the um uh when
*  they wrote the constitution they were in their 20s and 30s a lot of them and if you were in their
*  40s almost none were in their 60s and 70s ben franklin was an old founding father back in the
*  day but you know jefferson and hamilton all those people madison you know they were young
*  and they were super educated right you know they spoke latin you know they they had all these
*  libraries full of books from of greek philosophy uh that congress had access to and they were really
*  up on the latest writings from europe about thinking about the social contract and the
*  enlightenment and human rights and things like that in a way that let's just say our current
*  political leadership is not on either side of the aisle so we've gotten away from that highly
*  educated you know in the united states for all of its flaws of the current system for all the flaws
*  the constitution has we were really lucky in many ways to get people who wrote it who were very
*  smart and also very high-minded you know they had their interests in mind but they really were
*  earnestly trying to put together a system that they thought would work we all know that there
*  are there were failures of that system the most obvious one is the fact that it didn't include
*  slaves or women or etc etc and you could argue whether or not it possibly could have but but
*  it doesn't matter the point is for the the present argument if we tried to sit down and write a
*  constitution now just by voting people into some sort of congressional assembly or constitutional
*  convention and had them write it i would be horrified at what might come out i would have
*  very very low expectations at what might appear from that uh i don't know mandatory gun ownership
*  or something like that i don't know what it would be but um it would be nice if uh the discourse that
*  we had in our current political system was a little bit more elevated i don't know how to get
*  there i have no practical suggestions along those lines sorry about that alex b says if jurassic
*  park were real and escaped t-rex was hunting down humans trapped in the park would you support
*  killing it to save humans even if it was the last of its kind well yes that would be pretty easy
*  both for sort of moral ethical reasons i think that the inner life of a human being is much richer
*  and more valuable than that of a tyrannosaurus but also if jurassic park were real by construction
*  we just made a t-rex so it's not the last of its kind we can just make another one i know that's
*  sort of cheating around your thought experiment there but in general you know i take human life
*  to be more valuable than the lives of other animals um that's not absolute there's spectra
*  here you know there's a continuum we're not completely different completely distinct from
*  other kinds of living beings here on earth we're all part of the same family etc etc but having
*  said that you know i do think that i i think that human beings are just different in the real world
*  for practical purposes jesse rimler says in the may ama you answered a question regarding the
*  russian invasion of ukraine in your answer you stated that noam chomsky had recently called
*  for ukraine to lie down and take it and surrender to russia i read chomsky's statement and i don't
*  think your comment reflects his statements to be fair you said it was a rough paraphrase here is
*  my summary of chomsky's position the u.s should use its influence to encourage a settlement between
*  ukraine and russia in order to end the war he notes that this diplomatic solution would not be
*  just but that the results of international diplomacy rarely are he says that ukraine's
*  resistance under zolensky has been honorable and that russian aggression is criminal not unlike our
*  invasion of iraq he critiques the u.s's current stance which is to support the war down to the
*  last ukrainian which will almost certainly lead to protracted conflict that kills more ukrainians
*  and terrifyingly raises the chances for nuclear war do you believe this position to be unreasonable
*  well i don't know whether it's reasonable or not but i believe it to be wrong and the reason is it's
*  not a matter of supporting the war down to the last ukrainian it's a matter of supporting what
*  the ukrainians want i am in favor of thinking less about what are what is in the united states's
*  interests in this particular question and thinking about what is in the interests of the people in
*  ukraine and they want to resist so i'm in favor of it i'm in favor of helping them resist if that's
*  what they want i think that the invasion was completely illegal and immoral and wrong and
*  it should not be allowed to stand if there's any way of resisting it and the ukrainians so far
*  have been really really good at resisting it i think that we should count our lucky stars that
*  they have been that good and give them all the help that we can
*  nicholas warsley says if and when quantum gravity is figured out do you think relativity will be
*  taught as a step like newtonian physics or is it likely we don't need it at all well relativity is
*  clearly going to be taught like newtonian physics and yet this is a this is a feature of how science
*  works it's not just one theory that is right and all the other theories that are wrong there are
*  theories that are right as limiting cases of other theories so when quantum gravity is figured out it
*  will almost certainly be the case in fact i'm tempted to say certainly if i if i were indulging
*  in such rhetoric uh that there will be a limit a classical limit of quantum gravity that looks like
*  general relativity right how do we know that well because general relativity is super duper successful
*  at accounting for things like gravitational lensing the orbit of mercury the prediction of black holes
*  gravitational waves the expansion of the universe at early times and so on and so on so it is
*  absolutely completely respectable to use classical general relativity rather than quantum gravity
*  even if quantum gravity is figured out in the regime where classical general relativity applies
*  and the thing is that the regime where there is gravity noticeable at all is almost entirely in
*  the regime where classical general relativity applies so it's really kind of the other way around
*  if we figure out quantum gravity that'll be great that'll be great for physics it'll be a huge
*  monumental intellectual achievement but as a practical matter if you need to do a calculation
*  in astrophysics or cosmology you're just going to use classical general relativity just like if we
*  want to fly a rocket to the moon we use newtonian physics perfectly well mark shoyern says the last
*  three volume Feynman lectures on physics sorry the three volume five lectures on physics represented
*  quite a radical departure from the usual freshman physics textbook it seems to have been largely
*  failure since as far as i know no introductory physics textbook since much resembles it even if
*  it's much beloved by more advanced students i'm curious what your thoughts are on the books
*  and whether there might be a better way to present introductory physics rather than the traditional
*  way so i think that the five million lectures are not a failure but they're not a model for other
*  physics textbooks i don't think that's a very useful thing useful way to think about them they
*  are used by plenty of people by students trying to learn physics by teachers who teach freshman
*  physics to get ideas for clever ways to teach things but they're at a slightly higher level
*  than you want for traditional physics curriculum and also there's there's no problem sets in the
*  books themselves there's other books that have come out since that have that have problems
*  and you know feinman does like to ramble on sometimes and he also has his own individual
*  things that he's interested in right that are fascinating they're all really cool but they kind
*  of slow you down if you're just trying to get to the basics of physics you're trying to teach the
*  first year students so i think that they're extremely successful as what they are which are
*  textbooks in physics that are good to dip into in many areas that's true there are many books in
*  you know general relativity or quantum field theory or whatever that are wonderful reference
*  books and books to have on your shelf once you've learned the subject but not the best books to
*  learn it from the start in terms of is there a better way to present introductory physics
*  i honestly don't know i have never taught introductory physics i have not taken it for
*  many many years i have no strong thoughts on it i would be happy if there were more glimpses of
*  the future in introductory physics courses so not just here is an inclined plane but a little bit
*  of an introduction to the frontiers of physics to get people a little bit more excited but that's
*  just sort of a bonus extra thing to put in there it's not really a restructuring of the of the
*  basic curriculum itself kathy seager says in the last chapters of something deeply hidden you write
*  about an emerging metric of space from the entanglement structure of the quantum state
*  from there you go on to defining areas a collection of degrees of freedom to be proportional to their
*  entanglement entropy and that leads to a geometry of space could this approach be run on a computer
*  simulation slash model or is it more likely a highly theoretical leprosy and demon thing
*  for which you have to know all the specifics beforehand to get something out of it
*  i think it's somewhere in between you know there's no obstacle in principle to running this kind of
*  idea on a computer but it would be very small scale you know the the thing about that we think
*  is true about space time if it does emerge from quantum mechanics is there's a huge number of
*  degrees of freedom in every very very tiny region of space i forget what the number is i think i
*  once figured out that in a cubic centimeter of space we're postulating something like
*  uh hilbert space of dimension 10 to the 10 to the 60th right so that's a lot of numbers a lot of
*  degrees of freedom that you're not going to be able to put on a computer anytime soon so what
*  you really be doing is a very very highly constrained toy model with just a few degrees
*  of freedom because simulating quantum things on classical computers is famously hard and that's
*  one of the reasons why quantum computers were invented in the first place but in principle you
*  know the equations should work out such that the structure is similar to the rest of physics where
*  you have initial conditions and you can evolve them over time or you just try to solve the quantum
*  equations through the path integral or whatever it is but it's it's the same kind of approach
*  as in the rest of physics jordan dansby says can you speak to the quantum mechanics of climate
*  change specifically the quantum concepts at play if any in the manner in which co2 molecules trap
*  heat energy radiating from the earth's surface so the short answer is no i mean there are obviously
*  quantum mechanics ideas that are required to understand why certain compounds in our atmosphere
*  let certain wavelengths of light through and trap other wavelengths of light i mean the basic idea
*  of the greenhouse effect is that we get visible light from the sun we put things in the atmosphere
*  that are transparent to visible light but opaque to infrared light and it's the infrared light that
*  is actually emitted back from the earth so you let light in but you don't let light out and we heat up
*  that's the greenhouse effect now you can derive in principle what frequencies of light will pass
*  through different kinds of gases from the principles of quantum mechanics i myself can't do that i mean
*  i could do that if you sat me down with a textbook and gave me time i could do it but i haven't
*  thought about those calculations mostly forever or even if i have it's been a very long time so i
*  can't do it off the top of my head but also more importantly the reason why i want to answer the
*  question is it doesn't matter it really doesn't once you know the answer once you know the spectrum
*  of light that passes through these particular kinds of gases which you can get just empirically just
*  experimentally just put the gas in a jar and pass light through it and see what spectrum goes through
*  and which one is absorbed that's all you need you don't need any quantum mechanics for that
*  and that's all the science that you really need at the simple it's the simplest level of science
*  you need to talk about climate change and the greenhouse effect etc so this is again you know
*  i don't want to harp on the same things over and over again this is emergence at work you don't
*  need to know the microphysics to understand what's happening at the macro level once you understand
*  the interaction of light and the gases that's what you need for the higher level computations
*  such as climate change bruno to share us as isn't strong emergence kind of anti-naturalist
*  what am i missing i don't think it's necessarily anti-naturalist so strong emergence is the idea
*  well let me back up a little bit i'm not sure that people give very good definitions of strong
*  emergence and as i've said many times the sad thing about discussions of emergence is they all
*  devolve into discussions of the definition of emergence which is incredibly boring and so i
*  don't i don't kind of want to worry too much about the definition so let me tell you my
*  idea that comes to mind when someone says strong emergence we imagine that there is a way of
*  thinking about some thing in the universe by dividing it up into constituents right so you
*  can think about the table in front of me as made of atoms or you can think about society as made
*  of people okay in either case you're taking a big system and dividing up into a set of interacting
*  smaller systems and then weak emergence is supposed to be the idea that we have a theory of the
*  individual constituents the atoms or the people or whatever and we put that all on a computer that
*  theory and in principle we had a sufficiently powerful computer and the theory of the individual
*  constituents we could put them all together in an initial condition run it and we would get the
*  right answer but we could also just discuss the collective at the same time so i can discuss the
*  tensile strength and the color and things like that of the table in front of me without knowing
*  anything about the atoms and at the same time if i did know about the atoms i could put them on a
*  computer and derive the properties of the table that's weak emergence strong emergence is you
*  have a theory of the fundamental constituents but if you put it together put just a bunch of
*  constituents individually on a computer and asked what happened you would not get the right answer
*  for whatever reason okay so that could be an anti-naturalist position because it could be that
*  you're saying you don't get the right answer because something spooky and ineffable comes in
*  and changes the behavior of the system that's one possibility but another possibility is that what
*  you thought was a completely comprehensive theory of the constituents actually wasn't
*  maybe the correct theory of the constituents is different if the constituents are just talking to
*  each other one to one versus being embedded in some larger collection okay that would be a in
*  principle completely naturalist kind of strong emergence and again i'm not completely sure that
*  makes sense but i can at least imagine it i don't i don't know that it doesn't make sense
*  it doesn't happen in if your tiny systems are atoms or molecules or elementary particles
*  because those obey local laws of physics as we talked about earlier in the ama they don't care
*  whether they're in an atom or a rock or a table or interstellar space all the electron cares about
*  is what the fields of other fields are doing at the same point in space time so there's no room
*  for strong emergence there but if your small systems are something like people then maybe this
*  the relationship is more complicated you know we have a very clean crisp relationship between
*  atoms and gases or solids the relationship between people and societies is a little bit
*  messier where you draw the boundaries and how do things affect each other and stuff like that so
*  i'm open to the possibility that when the individual constituents are themselves complex
*  there might be situations in which strong emergence is a useful way of thinking about things
*  i don't know for sure that there is but i'm open to that possibility
*  so
*  Gregory Kusnik says since we can't know the details of our present microstate we're forced to accept
*  that there's a set of possible past microstates from which our current state could have evolved
*  it seems to me that observations of events in the present constrain the set of past microstates
*  in much the same way they constrain future microstates but the conventional view of causality
*  says that it only flows in one direction from past to future what then should we call the backward
*  kind of constraint well as i've discussed before you're right that from only our observations of
*  our present macrostate you would be able to say the same kinds of things about the future and
*  about the past the present microstate implies more or less similar sets of possibilities for one
*  one direction of time and the other but that's not the universe we live in or at least that's not all
*  we have access to we also have the past hypothesis we also know that the early universe had low
*  entropy so that's an extra feature we have about the past that we don't have about the future there
*  is no known or plausibly conjectured future boundary condition that ties things down at all
*  so it's not that there is something intrinsic to time that lets us take the current microstate and
*  talk about its past and future development differently it's that we have an extra piece
*  of information in the past and it's from that extra piece of information the low entropy past
*  that we derive the fact that at the emergent higher level there are things called cause and
*  effect relationships that flow from the past to the future so i think what you're thinking of is
*  just the past hypothesis ross hastings asked a priority question i've been sufficiently troubled
*  by your conversation with sally haslinger that i've waited some months before commenting and in
*  the light of global events since it sits all the more uncomfortably today i'm a lifelong leftist
*  who believes that woke ideology is dangerous divisive elitist and actually racist and i would
*  love to hear some balancing commentary on your show my question today is will you consider talking
*  with an alternative voice the short answer is no i will not consider talking with an alternative
*  voice about those specific issues about anti-wokeism or anything like that for a number of reasons i
*  mean first and primarily a sufficient reason is that's not what this podcast is about mindscape
*  is about trying to understand the world trying to understand uh hopefully eternal truths eternal
*  might be an exaggeration because political economic social literary truths still count and those are
*  a little bit more ephemeral but it's about analysis and about understanding difficult issues it is not
*  about fighting whatever culture war battle is occupying people's attention at the moment
*  i'm happy to have people on the show who are active in such battles on either side but i'm
*  not going to talk to them about that okay i actually you know i think that such battles
*  are important i don't want to discount them there are many important things that we don't do
*  here on mindscape uh here we're trying to do something different and i like the fact that
*  we're trying to do something different i will have sally haslinger on the podcast but it wasn't
*  a rant about wokeism we were talking about the social construction of reality this is a crucially
*  important philosophical topic i had neil ferguson on the podcast and he kept wanting to talk about
*  cancel culture but i was more interested in talking about history and complexity and organizations
*  and things like that we had yasha monk on the podcast who has been outspoken on these issues
*  on the other side also but we talked about liberal democracy that was what he's an expert on and we
*  hope to understand the world a little bit better so that's what i'm all about here also however
*  you know i i want to be completely honest here in my view the intellectual case such as it is
*  offered by these anti-woke folks is incredibly weak and unpersuasive almost hilariously so and i
*  do want to have different perspectives on the podcast but i don't want to have any perspective
*  on the podcast my rule has always been i want to bring people on the podcast who have something
*  interesting to say even if i disagree with them very deeply like you know philip gulf talking
*  about panpsychism i completely disagree but i do think it's an important thing to think about it's
*  a perspective that shouldn't be dismissed i'm not going to have astrologers or flat earthers and to
*  me this is the category that these anti-woke people are in in in my view discrimination and
*  systemic biases are just extremely real and perfectly obvious a truly horrible aspect of
*  life in the modern world i mean it's i i can't see how someone can deny the existence of these things
*  and be outraged by them and want to fight against them i think that what we need to do
*  is the hard work of figuring out where these systematic systemic biases are fighting against
*  them and more importantly recognizing the biases within ourselves that cause us to deny their
*  existence people go bending over backwards to sort of ignore the discrimination that is right in front
*  of them if it makes them feel bad and i think that's kind of silly and embarrassing and we need to do
*  better that's not to say i will not disagree with the tactics used by people on the more woke side
*  if you want to call them that i very often do disagree with the tactics use the strategies
*  but my goals are entirely aligned with people who are against racism sexism transphobia etc
*  if my goals are the same as theirs then fundamentally we're allies and when i disagree
*  with them it is in the service of better attaining the goals so i'm much more of a
*  free speech absolutist than a typical woke person is i want to allow all sorts of speakers on campus
*  even people who i think are truly terrible if some tiny group of students on campus wants to invite
*  a terrible speaker then i'm entirely in favor of that and i don't even think you should heckle them
*  i should i think you should let them give their talk but the reason why i think that is because
*  i think the principle of letting anyone give talks and hearing their voices is fundamentally
*  a principle that will ultimately help fight discrimination and racism etc rather than
*  using silencing as a tool i think that's just a mistake of strategy but the fact that i disagree
*  on strategy doesn't mean i disagree on goals and i don't treat those people as my enemies or the
*  people i'm fighting against so i mean i think if a person with a public platform says that they are
*  let's say anti-racist but then you listen to how they spend their time on their public platform
*  they're never complaining about racism but they're often complaining about the excesses of
*  anti-racism then you know effectively they're fighting for the other side whatever may be
*  lurking inside their heart their actual actions speak differently and so i'm just not interested
*  in giving them an even bigger voice and that's that the final thing i will say is there's no
*  shortage of places on the internet where you can hear that perspective being said right it's not
*  like some plucky minority which can't get its message out the anti-woke campaign or whatever
*  you want to call it plenty of places where you can hear that perspective being articulated if
*  anything what i want to do if only sort of by example is to reclaim the language of logic and
*  truth and facts which has been appropriated sometimes by these people and i think it's been
*  wildly misappropriated i think that they're denying science they are not being rigorously
*  logical and careful they are using a lot of sophistry to prop up a lot of very questionable
*  points of view so i want to be a counter example i don't want to help them out they don't need my
*  help they're very very noisy they're very very ubiquitous across these platforms so what i am
*  standing for here is something very different than that
*  brian tidmore says if humankind were to advance technologically enough to build a machine that
*  could manipulate gravity do you have any guesses what such a device might look like would it need
*  to be capable of manipulating quantum fields slash particles or would it function in ways scientists
*  cannot presently imagine well i can i had there are machines that manipulate gravity they're called
*  uh masses large objects manipulate gravity by causing gravity i think that there is you know
*  a possible conceptual error in thinking about manipulating gravity in a way that is different
*  from simply putting a heavy object there and let it attract things because that's really all we can
*  do when it comes to manipulating gravity the reason why that we think that maybe we can do
*  otherwise is because the other example that we have in nature of a long-range force is
*  electromagnetism and so we sort of train ourselves on electromagnetism and think maybe someday we'll
*  be able to do similar things with gravity but the huge difference is that for electromagnetism we
*  have positive charges and negative charges for gravity roughly speaking we only have positive
*  charges everything attracts right there i say roughly speaking because there's some little
*  footnotes but for technological purposes those footnotes are not very relevant roughly speaking
*  gravitationally everything attracts everything to everything else gravity is a very dumb simple
*  force in that way whereas electromagnetism from the simple fact that there are positive charges
*  and negative charges is sort of infinitely manipulatable because you can create sets of
*  many positive charges and negative charges and have some of them go in motion and so forth and
*  create all sorts of very delicately tuned electric and magnetic fields with gravity you just can't do
*  that with a positive charge and a negative charge you can cancel out electric fields in different
*  places and amplify them in other places with gravity all you can do is create more of it
*  or less of it by taking an object and move it further away so roughly i think that as far as
*  we currently understand gravity we're not going to be able to manipulate it in the same way that
*  we can manipulate electromagnetic fields timothy carroll asks a priority question i'm very aware of
*  your presentation of the particle at the end of the universe and the halls of the royal institution
*  it's been nine years since your beautiful explanation on the hunt for the higgs some
*  physicists feel that the construction of a new particle collider with higher power is not the
*  best use of research dollars do you feel the same way or could you justify this extreme financial
*  burden for a new facility you know i think it's an important question and a difficult question
*  but it's not a question you should expect an objective answer to for two reasons number one is
*  we do not have a fixed pot of money that we sit down and say what is the best way we can spend
*  this on research right it's not like there's a fixed number of dollars we say okay biology gets
*  so many and chemistry gets so many and particle physics gets so many this is a lesson that has
*  been beaten home over and over again when we've had an expensive science project that people have
*  campaigned against on the theory that the money could be better spent elsewhere and the project
*  gets cancelled and guess what the money does not get spent on science at all because there's no
*  rule that the amount of money spent on science has to be fixed so generally when you have these giant
*  particle accelerators or telescopes or whatever the question is not do you spend it on this or
*  do you spend it on other science the question is do you spend it on this or do you just spend
*  on something completely different not scientific at all and the other thing is you know this is
*  not a decision made by the world right these facilities are built in countries in the countries
*  or the groups of countries that build them generally decide what they want to do with the money
*  so if some country of china or europe or whoever wants to build a giant particle accelerator that's
*  the choice that they are going to make or not make again it doesn't come out of the money from
*  other countries and finally i think i said two things but it's really three things
*  there is a difference between building a giant particle accelerator and doing other kinds of
*  experiments namely that the kinds of answers you would get the kind of things you would learn from
*  a giant particle accelerator are just not achievable in any other way you can do experiments in you
*  know cosmic rays or tabletop experiments and maybe you will get a hint of the existence of
*  other particles but you can't figure out what particles they are you just can't get the detailed
*  close-up look and there's some kinds of new particles that you just can't discover in that
*  indirect way you just have to smash other particles together and see what comes out that's really the
*  only thing that you can do so when you were thinking about whether or not it's worth the
*  money and again i have no idea whether it's worth the money because i don't know what the options
*  are in spending the money otherwise but when you're figuring that out it is it's just a mistake
*  to compare it to to say like well i spent a million dollars on this and got a certain research
*  output but this is costing 10 billion dollars is it really 10 000 times worth 10 000 of the original
*  experiment because the original experiments don't scale like that you know if you have some really
*  really good tabletop atomic physics experiment that costs a million dollars it won't be a hundred
*  times better if you spend a hundred million dollars on it or if you do a hundred of them right
*  some experiments can be done for small amounts of money some just need large amounts of money and
*  in the current state of technology you can't do high energy particle physics in a very effective
*  way without spending a lot of money so i think it is in a unique kind of project where there's
*  lots of justification for trying to do it on the other hand the justification is not cut and dried
*  because unlike with the large hadron collider we don't have a target right with the LHC we had the
*  target of the Higgs boson and more generally the electroweak scale where we were hoping to find
*  things we only found the Higgs so far we're still hopeful to find something new but we haven't yet
*  whereas if you build the next collider without having found anything new at the LHC you're
*  just going on a fishing expedition if you find something it will be incredibly important the
*  first super direct obvious evidence of physics beyond the standard model but i can't promise
*  you or even give you good odds that we will find something for any particular machine so that is a
*  strike against making spending a lot of money on these machines it's a hard call to make and i'm
*  glad that i'm not the one making it eric stromquist says when people have asked you in earlier ama's
*  about possible mathematical realism about the world you've said that you are a reality realist
*  instead my question is but what about the supervenience of low level physical facts
*  and structure on the mathematical structure of whatever will be completed physics to clarify
*  i focus on mathematical structure rather than mathematics because mathematics is a human
*  endeavor that may be merely nominalistic while mathematical structure is what human mathematics
*  purports to describe atomistic objects like points and set theory or category theory having
*  no intrinsic properties but only relational properties with other such atomistic objects
*  the world's actual structure is mathematical because it would in turn
*  supervene on the correct mathematical symbology of completed physics so i'll have to confess i just
*  don't know what this means in some sense you know i know that people have made claims about physical
*  reality being in some sense intrinsically mathematical whether they're saying that it
*  is math in some sense like max tagmark might want to gesture toward i that i just don't understand
*  at all but even the slightly weaker claim that somehow the physical world is a mathematical
*  kind of structure i don't know what that means i don't know what the difference is between a
*  mathematical kind of structure and a non-mathematical kind of structure i mean is an apple a mathematical
*  structure because if i have two apples and get two more apples i have four apples i i just don't know
*  what it means i know what it means to say that i can use math to describe physical structures that's
*  what i do all the time that's what physics does and i'm very happy to do that but to somehow attribute
*  mathematicalness to a physical structure i just don't know how to do that or what it means so
*  i don't think that there is any issue here in my own mind i could be missing something i'm not
*  claiming to be a super expert on this stuff but that's how i think about it jeff b says i was
*  chatting with a friend who was interested in physics and he wrote the following my theory is
*  that the universe is an inside out black hole and the event horizon is the edge of the observable
*  universe this explains the redshift of light we see since black holes also have light redshifted
*  around them i knew there were a few things that didn't quite seem right about this but i usually
*  listen to you for quantum stuff rather than the cosmology stuff so i wasn't exactly sure how to
*  respond can you respond for me well you know look uh that's not a theory to say the universe is an
*  inside out black hole is not a theory for one thing it doesn't make sense there's no such thing
*  as an inside out black hole i don't even know what that means okay um the universe is described by a
*  cosmological metric to very very good um precision i think the deeper issue here is that well there's
*  a whole bunch of issues um one issue is that if you believe general relativity at all which
*  presumably you do if you're talking about black holes right there are prediction of general
*  relativity you've talked about black holes and event horizons and black holes redshifting light
*  if you believe all that stuff presumably you believe general relativity then in general
*  relativity the universe is expanding or contracting and empirically it's expanding and that is the
*  redshift there's no need for an extra explanation you cannot say i believe general relativity but i
*  don't think the universe is expanding or contracting and that's just not how the equations work okay
*  so we already have explained this you don't need a new explanation furthermore and at a more detailed
*  level uh the redshift that is associated with galaxies and quasars and so forth is not just one
*  phenomenon all by itself there are many phenomena that fit together uh the expansion of the universe
*  the early universe and nucleosynthesis the growth of structure in the universe the fact that there
*  are gravitational time delays as well as gravitational redshifts there are many phenomena all of which
*  fit into the usual kind of picture and if you say well the usual kind of picture is not right i have
*  a new picture you got to re-explain all of those phenomena okay so if someone says you know i have
*  a theory about the universe that is new and exciting just say all right in your theory what
*  is the ratio of hydrogen to helium produced in the early universe and when they tell you that
*  ask them what the amount of deuterium and lithium is okay until you get to that level of detail
*  which the standard model explains very very well it's not really worth taking alternative theories
*  very seriously kevin o'Toole says whenever you discuss a quantum field like the electron positron
*  field the mathematical object i picture is basically like the electric field i imagine a vector or at
*  every point in space or maybe a matrix or something however i know this picture can't possibly be
*  correct because of entanglement data at each point is a local description so unless i'm missing
*  something it can't encapsulate correlations that exist between distant points in space so then what
*  is the correct mathematical structure to be picturing you know this is going to be one of
*  my deflationary answers here you can't picture it sorry no one ever does picture it you know it's
*  not just you um lennard suskind or edward witten or neemar khani himed are all picturing something
*  like the electric field when they picture a quantum field they know it's not right right they know
*  that there are other ways of thinking about it that are purely mathematical right they can calculate
*  the correlation functions or they can calculate the entanglement entropy between different regions
*  of space they know how to manipulate the thing but our visualization capacities are just not up to
*  the task we don't have enough dimensions in our brain to really think about entanglement between
*  a whole bunch of quantum fields at different points in space so what you should be thinking
*  about is the mathematical description of the quantum state of these uh fields that you know
*  it might be not what you want to think about but that's the correct way of thinking about it
*  kymona cook says do you think there is something special and or real about the present uh no
*  i don't i mean my present self has something real about the present but my future self will have
*  nothing special about the present moment at every moment there you there's stuff that exists and
*  that is the stuff that exists in the present moment it's just a label it's like saying is there
*  anything special about latitude 30 degrees north you know it exists but there's nothing special or
*  ontologically distinct about it jim murphy says what are your some of your favorite live music
*  experiences um you know yeah i've gone to a bunch of various kinds of concerts and so forth uh i'm
*  not nearly as big a music fan as some other people are so i wouldn't get uh i don't have the depth of
*  experience that some other people have you know my the best live music experiences have been at
*  tiny little jazz clubs right when i was at chicago i used to go down to the new apartment lounge on
*  the south side and listen to von freeman play on tuesday nights deep into the evening and you know
*  sitting five feet away from the band right and not the most elegant surroundings but a wonderful
*  melting pot of different kinds of people locals from the neighborhood music aficionados from
*  around the world students from the university of chicago and so forth and it was just tremendous
*  fun and uh the band was amazing you know improvising in ways that you don't get to hear much on the radio
*  and things like that so i would i would have to pick that as my favorite kind of music experience
*  don't get it that much here in los angeles i'm afraid brendan kruger says if your brain was
*  strong enough to envision future events down to the most fundamental scale of physics would
*  calculating a future state of the universe in your head temporarily create a new universe
*  so i get the question and you know my the initial feeling is to dismiss it but i don't think it's an
*  easily dismissed question upon further reflection but i think what is so the idea here is that if
*  you're literally simulating the complete behavior of everything in the universe whether it's in your
*  brain or in a computer does that count as a universe right i mean because you're simulating
*  the whole thing that is going on so this is the point of view advocated in david chalmers's new
*  book you know we had david chalmers on the podcast a while ago talking about consciousness
*  but his new book reality plus is exactly advocating for the idea that if you simulate something
*  exactly then that thing that you've simulated exists in that simulation and i get that i'm
*  sympathetic to that i haven't thought through all the pluses and minuses so i can't promise you that
*  i would stick by that position but in some sense i think the answer to your question is yes but then
*  the there's a separate thing which is the attitude one should have towards such questions which is
*  you're cheating a little bit you're cheating a little bit by asking it because you're literally
*  saying if your brain was strong enough to envision future events down to the most fundamental scale
*  of physics okay your brain is not strong enough nor will it ever be nor could it be because the
*  point is you basically need your brain to be as large as the universe to do that at the level of
*  simulating the entire universe so what i'm saying is that in order to physically realize this kind
*  of simulation you basically would be creating a new universe it's not just a matter of doing
*  you know mental exercises to improve your thought processes it's a much more dramatic kind of thought
*  experiment that you're that you're doing here and i think that we are a little bit too quick to
*  generalize the fact that you know i can visualize in my head a game of chess or checkers therefore
*  why can't i visualize everything in the universe it's just a matter of degree right well sometimes
*  the matters of degree matter by a lot and i think this is the case michael cirotenko says i'm now
*  reading a chapter about chaos in a book about complexity after giving an example of an equation
*  that can lead to an unpredictable result with any infinitely small change of the input the author
*  concludes that this implies that perfect prediction a la laplace is not possible not only in practice
*  but also in principle but is it if we build such a model of the universe that takes only rational
*  numbers as initial conditions we still make exact predictions right you know a lot of this depends on
*  what you mean by in principle and what you mean by prediction okay it remains true even in the
*  presence of chaotic dynamics that exactly specified initial conditions lead to exactly predictable
*  future conditions okay that's what laplace's demon says what is being traded on in discourse like this
*  is that you never have access to exact initial conditions for any real physical system you can
*  imagine counterfactually if the initial conditions were such and such rational numbers then you could
*  make the prediction but the point being made is you never know that that is the initial condition
*  and both things are true it is both true that there is determinism that given the exact initial
*  conditions the later final conditions are exactly predicted and that you don't have access to that
*  i personally think that this has nothing to do with chaos theory i mean people make it into a big new
*  distinction that you know we discovered this when we discovered chaos theory but look laplace never
*  thought that in practice we were going to be able to have perfect information and without perfect
*  information you can't make perfect predictions the dynamics of chaos theory help you quantify how bad
*  your predictions are going to be but we always knew they wouldn't be perfect because you don't
*  have access to that information so i don't think that there's any big conceptual shift
*  brought on in the determinism discussion by the fact that we now know that some dynamics can be
*  chaotic andrew goldstein says i'm probably conservative when i estimate the number of
*  academic communication writing researching and interviewing activities that you are engaged in
*  so i ask how do you embrace and maintain this extensive and diverse schedule not to mention
*  your personal life where you presumably get to enjoy the realities of nature that you so
*  exquisitely articulate i mean i don't know i mean thank you for the implied compliment there but
*  as i said before i've been fortunate enough to be able to shape a life a world a job where i can do
*  a little bit of all these different things that i like it means that i'm not nearly as devoted to
*  any one of them as i could be right i don't spend as much time doing physics research as i could
*  i don't spend as much time and effort writing books as i could or even the podcast right
*  i try very hard when i take on these new activities to limit them to limit the amount of time it would
*  take so for the podcast it's literally limited to one day per week i produce one podcast a week
*  and producing a podcast takes about a day if it ever grows more than that i would not be able to
*  do it so i mean i could do better about editing or whatever musical cues i don't know but i'm not
*  going to do that this is this is what it's going to be now i have a new job that involves teaching
*  and other new responsibilities that i didn't have in the last couple years so something might have
*  to go something else might need to be downshifted we'll have to see about that but it hasn't quite
*  hit yet i certainly don't have any secrets or magic elixirs to get a lot of things done i've just sort
*  of been stubborn enough to insist that i can do them and lucky enough to be able to be given the
*  opportunity to actually make it happen okay final question humberto noni says during your podcast
*  with lennard susskind he answered your question about his activities in the realm of writing the
*  theoretical minimum books by talking about how he wanted to teach real science versus crackpotism
*  to his parents and to his parents friends it's a very touching story so besides us the general
*  audience that is interested in your videos and books on the biggest ideas is there a particular
*  set of persons you are targeting short answer is no or at least not in general the longer answer is
*  i target different sets of people with different things that i do so when i write a textbook in
*  physics i'm targeting one set of people when i write a technical paper in physics i'm targeting
*  a different set of people when i'm writing a book it's a different set of people when i'm doing a
*  podcast it's yet a different set of people when i tweet it's yet a different set of people
*  and as i said many times in many different circumstances that's not the only way to do it
*  you know you can absolutely i'm a big believer in the power of specialization in the right
*  circumstances i think that the problem with specialization is when everyone is a specialist
*  i think that a healthy ecosystem needs both generalists and specialists and this is true
*  for science but it's also true for communication so i'm glad that there are some people who only
*  write poems or only do podcasts or whatever and only aim at a certain kind of audience
*  you know my audience is not universal i don't aim at everybody every time you know i'm not especially
*  good at or interested in writing for kids for example i it is more my style to assume some
*  basic background knowledge and maturity sometimes the level is different you know in the biggest
*  ideas in the universe videos and books it's assuming more of the reader than previous books
*  have it's not assuming necessarily background but it's assuming a certain gumption in being able to
*  go through these equations and really try to figure out what they're saying and not everyone
*  wants to do that and that's perfectly okay i would actually like to someday write a book or some books
*  that are aimed at an even bigger audience an even wider audience than what i've written so far you
*  know my probably my most pick-upable book was the particle at the end of the universe about the
*  higgs boson but still like there are chapters on gauge symmetry and quantum field theory in there
*  you know the biggest i that sorry the big picture what was i tried to write it at a very accessible
*  level but it covers so many things that it's not everyone's cup of tea you know i would like to
*  someday write just a short sweet book that had no equations in it that got something important across
*  but was you know attractive to a very broad audience haven't really done that yet so
*  the answer is there a particular set of persons i'm targeting different sets for different projects
*  is the is the slightly weasely but completely correct answer okay thanks everybody for supporting
*  the podcast on patreon it warms my heart to have you doing this
*  hope you enjoy the ama talk to you next month
*  you
