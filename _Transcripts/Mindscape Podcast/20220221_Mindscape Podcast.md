One of the brilliant achievements of Darwin’s theory of natural selection was to help explain apparently “purposeful” or “designed” aspects of biology in a purely mechanistic theory of unguided evolution. Features are good if they help organisms survive. But should we put organisms at the center of our attention, or the genetic information that governs those features? Arvid Ågren helps us understand the attraction of the “selfish gene” view of evolution, as well as its shortcomings. This biological excursion has deep connections to philosophical issues of levels and emergence.

Arvid Ågren received his Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Toronto. He is currently a Wenner-Gren Fellow at the Evolutionary Biology Centre at Uppsala University. Previously he worked at Cornell and Harvard. His recent book is The Gene’s-Eye View of Evolution.

# Mindscape 185 | Arvid Ågren on the Gene’s-Eye View of Evolution
**Mindscape Podcast:** [February 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf8lZxgmx4U)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Remember when we talked about the social construction of reality?
*  Wasn't that fun? We contrasted this human scale way of thinking about the world, the social world, where you make up
*  categories and then they're based on what really happens, but there's a lot of freedom there.
*  We contrasted that with the physics level, right, with the electrons and the photons, where it's pretty clear
*  how you want to think about the pieces out of which reality is made.
*  But there are a lot of layers in between the physics level and the social level, the human level, right?
*  There's all of biology, for example. Today we're going to dig into a puzzle, or at least an important research area, within
*  biology that involves exactly this. What is the right way to
*  conceptualize the world of species and populations and evolution?
*  Famously, Richard Dawkins in the 1970s popularized a view known as the selfish gene.
*  Back in the old days, in the beginning of the theory of evolution, you might have focused on individual
*  organisms and imagined these organisms wanted to reproduce their own genomes, right?
*  They wanted to have kids and have their genetic heritage be passed on to future generations.
*  Then came the math. Then came a way of thinking about population genetics that pointed out that you can pass on the genes
*  inside of you, even without you being involved, if all of your relatives are very good at passing on genes.
*  So it became not only Dawkins, but other people point out that it's as if
*  it's the genes that want to pass on their heritage, not the individuals carrying them.
*  In fact, you could say that the individuals are just kind of a bus full of genes.
*  They're a vehicle that carries on the genes because
*  individuals die, right? Organisms are born. They have a life. They die. Less than a century for most species.
*  Whereas the genes can live on a very, very long time, being passed from generation to generation.
*  So surprisingly, not everyone agrees. Not so surprisingly, of course. This is a complicated thing.
*  What is the best way to conceptualize
*  levels of selection? This is what we call this particular debate in biology.
*  Is it at the level of genes, of species, of populations, of individuals?
*  And it's exactly this kind of how do you divide up reality kind of question. The answer from our
*  guest today, Arvid Ahgren, who's worked as a biologist on this problem, is he's actually pretty pro
*  the selfish gene view, or as he calls it, the genes eye view of evolution.
*  But he completely admits that it's not the end-all.
*  Biology is more complicated, as we've often found out here on Mindscape, than something easy like physics is. There's leakage
*  between the levels of genes and molecules up to organisms, up to populations.
*  So there's insight to be gained by thinking about things from the selfish gene point of view.
*  There's also insight to be gained by thinking about higher levels of abstraction.
*  It's a wonderful real-world example of the philosophical questions that we have about
*  emergence, complexity, how to chunk the universe up into pieces that we can analyze and theorize about.
*  So I think it's a great kind of discussion. It's very Mindscape-y, as I make the joke in the podcast.
*  Both me and the evil Sean Carroll, the biologist, who is a previous Mindscape guest, are referenced in Arvid's book.
*  So it's a very natural kind of conversation for us to have here. Let's go.
*  Arvid Orgrin, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So I think we can assume that most of the audience is familiar with Darwinian
*  evolution theory, natural selection, and maybe also a little bit of
*  Mendel and genetics.
*  But let's start with the groundwork at the synthesis of these two great ideas, right?
*  The modern synthesis. It still boggles my mind a little bit that Darwin didn't know about genetics.
*  He went pretty far without knowing about that.
*  But tell us how that came together in the 20th century.
*  Yeah, so this is really is one of the kind of striking moments in the history of biology,
*  what has become known as the modern synthesis of biology in the kind of 1920s, 1930s.
*  And as you say, it is kind of came together by bringing two different insights into one theory.
*  On the one hand, it was Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and a theory about individual organisms.
*  Organisms vary in how well they survive and reproduce.
*  And if any of those traits are heritable, they will become more common over time.
*  Now, the big problem for Darwin then was, as you say, that he had no functioning theory of inheritance.
*  And while he kind of had some ideas of his own, none of them really came to work.
*  And that remained a conundrum for him and kind of viewed as a weakness for a long time of his theory.
*  This was in parallel then with the second insight that was brought to it.
*  And that was a functioning theory of inheritance.
*  And that was provided by Gregor Mendel's work, where the realization that inheritance functioned with this inheritance of this discrete particular entities, which we now refer to as genes.
*  And so, I mean, if we didn't know about genes and we didn't know about how discrete they were, clearly there's some degree of inheritance.
*  Everyone can see that in hair color and things like that.
*  But you might have thought that things would just blend together every time, right?
*  And that you would never diverge.
*  Everything would just become some kind of homogeneous, unified organism or something like that in terms of sharing the same equilibrated characteristics.
*  But with discrete units, all sorts of funny things can happen.
*  Exactly. And indeed, that Darwin, for a while, believed in his sort of blending inheritance and that the realization that you were quickly run out of variation from that spectrum to act upon was a kind of serious issue for him.
*  The problem then with this new theory of inheritance in the form of discrete entities was that how could that be reconciled with the gradualism of on the one hand, variance as we see it in the natural world, but also with a gradualism as envisioned by Darwinian evolution, the gradual change over time.
*  And this is really what the emergence of what we now refer to as population genetics.
*  The idea that you can describe evolution as changes in certain variants of genes or allele frequencies over time.
*  But that is what kind of evolution almost has come to be defined as.
*  If you open an evolution textbook today, that evolution is changing allele frequencies in a population over time.
*  So change is inheritable.
*  I guess I don't quite see how that answers the question of the apparent smoothness of variation.
*  I would have just said that variation is smooth because there's a lot of genes and you can just change one at a time.
*  It looks almost like it's continuous.
*  And exactly that is what the solution that population geneticists found strong upon.
*  And particularly the English statistician and evolution geneticist Ronald Fisher show that you could get the appearance of gradual variation from the if a trait was caused by many alleles with small effects.
*  You can reconcile the gradualism with the discrete inheritance.
*  And that really represented this major achievement that was part of this general synthesis of bringing together multiple parts of biology into one.
*  I think you already explained it, but I'm going to ask you again to explain the word allele because it's not exactly the same as the word gene, right?
*  It is not. So allele is a version of a gene.
*  So, for example, we may think of a gene for, say, eye color, but then you can have multiple alleles, one for blue eyes, one for brown eyes, for example.
*  So while we have one gene for that as a human, we have one allele from our father and one allele from our mother that we have inherited.
*  So I think probably the person on the street would talk about a gene for blue eyes or a gene for brown eyes.
*  But really, there's one gene for eye color and there's an allele for brown eyes or blue eyes.
*  Yeah. And then in most of the cases, you have many genes with multiple alleles underlying most traits most of the time.
*  OK, very good. And what is a gene?
*  I ask everyone, I ask every biologist this question.
*  They always get uncomfortable when I ask it.
*  It's a practical little word in biology that has come to mean quite different things, depending on what corner of biology you are from.
*  In kind of theoretical population genetics, it is simply something that kind of stably inherited, something that you can say affects a trait.
*  To a molecular biologist, it has a much more physical or materialistic definition of it.
*  That is, a sequence of DNA that often has a function or encodes a protein or RNA that does something.
*  And indeed, it's kind of multiple definitions of use of genes within biology has often led to misunderstandings and disagreements.
*  So I guess even when we had Mendelian genetics, Mendel was still in the 19th century, but then it was sort of glued on or incorporated into evolutionary theory in the 20th century.
*  But we still didn't have DNA at that point, right?
*  So, I mean, happily, we have DNA now.
*  Did that change the way we thought about this a lot or did it just get serving as an underpinning for the existing discussion about genetics?
*  The first approximation changed a lot in what we think of what genes are.
*  We can study it in a completely different way.
*  We have a sense of the number of genes that a species has and how they evolve.
*  At the same time, it is important to remember that population genetics as an approach, as a field, as you say,
*  emerged before we knew what the material basis of heredity was, before we knew that it was DNA, before we knew that DNA was a double helix.
*  And those mathematical models that we still use in evolutionary biology were developed before that, before we had any idea of those.
*  And there you rely on a definition of a gene that's completely agnostic about the material basis.
*  And I do think it's rather remarkable that they work so well, despite being completely ignorant about what the material basis actually is.
*  Except that it let us invent a new meaning for the word gene, right?
*  So we had the word gene and then we found DNA and they invented a new meaning for the word gene, namely a sequence of DNA that encodes for a protein.
*  Yes, yes. I mean, the population genetics gene, as we use it still in population, is much closer in a way to the original Mendelian gene as it was originally.
*  But it is certainly one of those words, one of many in biology that have similar enough meaning that people can think that they are talking about the same thing, but they are different enough to cause frustration.
*  Well, you've written a book called The Gene's Eye View.
*  And what do you mean by the word gene in the title of your book?
*  Or does it not matter?
*  So the Gene's Eye View uses the word gene in this much more old fashioned way of simply defining something that's stably inherited, a part of a chromosome that's stably inherited across generation.
*  And this means that it can be almost arbitrarily long a gene.
*  It can be anything that's kind of inherited together, which means that the parts of the Y chromosome, for example, that never recombines with the X can be thought of as one gene or kind of large swastika chromosome or indeed very small part of chromosome.
*  It's also thought of as a gene here, but it is kind of this definition agnostic about any sort of material basis.
*  And how do we know? How much do we know about the genetic composition of, let's say, the human genome?
*  Like, does everyone agree that it's divided into so and so many genes, the human DNA?
*  To first approximation, yes.
*  I think everyone is in the same order of magnitude.
*  You may. I don't know exactly what the latest number is.
*  When I was taught it, it was somewhere between 20 and 25000 genes.
*  I think someone who did with the latest updates of the human genome, you're going to find a precise number.
*  And I think I'm sure experts disagree.
*  But to first approximation, I think everyone kind of agrees that this is the number.
*  This is all off topic a little bit.
*  But since I have you here, I'm just sort of satisfying my curiosity about a bunch of these questions.
*  Do we have differential data about the persistence of different genes over time?
*  I mean, are some genes very malleable over evolutionary time scales and others stick around?
*  Yeah, no. Certainly we know that we have something called pseudogenes, which are genes that are still around.
*  They're still recognized as genes, but they've lost their function in humans.
*  So, for example, my favorite example is that we have the gene that allows you to synthesize vitamin C from scratch, which is present in most mammals.
*  But we have that gene, it's clearly recognizable, but it doesn't work.
*  We don't do it.
*  It's lost its function.
*  So it's in us, some of our primate relatives, and I think in fruit bats that have lost that ability and carry this around.
*  And so there it's around.
*  It hasn't, selection hasn't gotten rid of it.
*  Right.
*  But there are also certainly examples of where if you compare species that are distantly related, you can see that they retain some genes in common, but sometimes they've lost genes or gained other genes.
*  So in my naive physicist way of thinking about things, I would imagine that in any stretch of DNA, there's sort of a chance per unit generation that a mutation happens.
*  And in those stretches that really matter to our functioning, if a bad mutation happens, it gets weeded out, it gets selected out of the population.
*  And in places where it doesn't matter that much, those can just continue to mutate away.
*  So is it true that certain stretches of DNA maintain their integrity longer than we would think because they're really, really important to us?
*  Yeah, and indeed, that is often how the heart of the methods that are used to estimate how much natural selection is acting across a genome.
*  So if you think of all the DNA in an organism, we can ask questions like how much of this is under constant natural selection and how much of it is evolving just by chance or neutrally, as we say, which is going to be a function of things like
*  mutation rate and population size, essentially.
*  And this is something like how much questions like how important is natural selection versus evolution by randomness or genetic drift used to be quite contentious debate in population genetics, but one that has matured a lot in light of the abundance of data that we have now.
*  And it's much more kind of empirically informed, which is much more insightful now because we can simply go out and ask how much of this genome, the genome in this species is under selection and so on, which we couldn't before.
*  And let me guess the answer is that some parts selection is really important and other parts it's not.
*  Yeah, and in some species, most of it is under selection and some large sports is not.
*  And am I right to think that maybe in the back of our minds, when we think about selection pressures, we're thinking about some species going out there and hunting and becoming faster or stronger and therefore competing.
*  But really, a lot of the selection pressure is just that if you get the wrong mutation, you die or you're stillborn.
*  It's not really that sort of detailed capacity to get food or have sex or anything like that.
*  Yeah, I think that that represents obviously a crucial part of fitness for any organism.
*  But there's so much more going on in the life cycle of any organism.
*  A lot of it is that we can't see or just happens at the molecular level.
*  And often those machineries are evolutionary old and often quite sophisticated in keeping check that mutation rates are not too high or kind of the repair mechanisms that are in place.
*  Well, I guess so is it again, my naive physicist thing is every base pair would have a random chance of mutating and then the selection acts upon those mutations.
*  But is it are there even more sophisticated repair mechanisms than that?
*  Are there ways biologically or molecular biologically that the really important parts of DNA are protected from mutation?
*  Oh, I don't dare answer that in a confident way.
*  How that varies. Certainly, selection is stronger on important parts of the genome.
*  And I think, for example, that we carry around this gene for vitamin C, where you can accumulate almost any sort of mutation without selection doing anything about it.
*  How this kind of the efficacy of the DNA repair mechanisms vary across the genome, I must say, I don't know.
*  OK, I would just I'm just wondering, you know, if there's in quantum computing, we care a lot about what we call error correction, right?
*  Or even classical communication theory.
*  I can imagine that it would be evolutionarily advantageous to develop a cellular biology level mechanism that would just say, no, no, I'm not going to let any mutations happen in this part of the genome.
*  But I have no idea whether or not that's actually true.
*  Yeah, no, I'm curious, too.
*  OK, good. We'll bring you back if you if you invent one.
*  OK, so I think that I completely interrupted you multiple times there while you were trying to explain the modern synthesis.
*  What is the modern synthesis at the end of the day?
*  At the end of the day, the modern synthesis was kind of in a way the founding of the field of evolutionary biology as we know it today.
*  It is an event that brought together rather quite disparate fields of biology, everything from kind of paleontology to ecology to genetics into one cohesive science.
*  The science of evolution.
*  So on the one hand, it was kind of this crucial event of showing that Mendelian inheritance and Darwinian evolution are compatible and part of the same process.
*  But in many ways, you can also think of it as a big institutional event.
*  That's when the Society for the Study of Evolution was founded and the journals and kind of the starting the emergence of evolutionary biology as kind of as a department in university and so on.
*  So kind of the modern field of evolutionary biology was really born.
*  In that event as well.
*  It's interesting. I bet you don't always see.
*  I'm just saying again, I'm completely speculating.
*  I wonder how often I should say you see a parallel evolution of scientific knowledge and institutional support or institutional organization for thinking about it.
*  So you're saying that in the case of evolutionary biology, they went hand in hand.
*  I would think so.
*  I've recently kind of come around to this view of that part of the history of our other field of evolution and the importance of the kind of institutional aspects of building a new field.
*  Yeah.
*  And especially that this was so this kind of perhaps happened in the 1940s, which was just before the emergence of molecular biology.
*  And it was in some way, you can think of it.
*  This is almost this assault on old fashioned natural history, organismal based biology, but it's more modern science, which was considered to be the future.
*  And the recently this is Edward O.
*  Wilson at Harvard describes this very well.
*  And he's kind of when he was hired at the department was then the Department of Biology at Harvard around the same time as Jim Watson, co-inventor of discovery of the double helix.
*  And kind of their battles of what biology ought to be like.
*  And Wilson described it rather nicely in his autobiography, a naturalist.
*  And that kind of combined with that, we have recently had the 75th anniversary of the Journal of Evolution or the Evolution Journal here.
*  So it kind of made me reflect upon that part and the importance of people like Wilson.
*  Yeah, I mean, it is really fascinating because, of course, we we hope that science gets at some true facts about nature.
*  But we all know that it's done by human beings and it's not just done by individual human beings.
*  Right. Getting support from an institution, having jobs, getting funding, all this stuff matters in a really interesting way.
*  And of course, the other thing that matters that happened, I think, around that time is math.
*  Right. I mean, once you were beginning to be thinking about evolution in terms of population genetics, population is a number.
*  And you talk about the fraction of different genes and suddenly a bunch of equations first on the scene.
*  It's very much so. And population genetics remain in many ways the theoretical backbone of evolutionary biology.
*  Evolutionary biology, I would say, is part of biology that is perhaps the most
*  mathematicized and kind of population genetics, often borrowed models from from physics, statistical physics and similar kinds of models,
*  describing changes in allele frequencies from how physicists had described motion of objects.
*  Of course, there are other traditions. Evolutionary biology happily stole game theory from political science and economics and incorporated perhaps even more successfully as a way of doing things.
*  And there are also kind of other kind of quantitative methods, for example, in quantitative genetics, where you simply describe changes in phenotypes over time, for example, used in animal breeding and so on.
*  But I would say the kind of the emerging population genetics and in modern senses was instrumental in some ways in making evolutionary biology be viewed as a more exact science and something to be taken seriously.
*  I mean, it's certainly true that once you write down equations, even if your substantive content is exactly the same, you suddenly look more respectable because now you have equations in your papers.
*  You can go, oh, OK, now you're doing serious work.
*  Especially when you convince others you are not share the same obsession as you are, that you are to be taken seriously.
*  That's proven to be quite important.
*  And when we say that there is math, I mean, what are the quantities that are being followed by these equations?
*  In physics, you know, we have the position and velocity of particles.
*  So what are we keeping track of and deriving differential equations for in population genetics?
*  Population genetics have typically been considered the frequencies of a specific allele in a population.
*  And you kind of you can say if you have an allele with these properties and has, say, this effect on fitness under what circumstances can it invade a population?
*  So can it become more common as the generations go by?
*  And all the things you're interested in keeping track of are things like mutation rates.
*  How often does this mutation happen?
*  This mutation population size.
*  So in large population, natural selection will be more effective, whereas in small population, chance will play a bigger role if it's strongly advantageous.
*  So it was known as the selection coefficient.
*  So how how strongly is the selection acting on this specific allele?
*  Those are the most basic parameters.
*  And then you can introduce all sorts of complexities in terms of population structure and relatedness between individuals, interacting assumptions about the lifecycle,
*  whether you sexually or asexually and how mating is determined and almost any aspect that you're interested in.
*  But in traditional population genetics, these are the basic parameters of population size, mutation rates, selection coefficients and so on.
*  Well, that's interesting. I think we run immediately into some philosophy of science questions here because things like the frequency of alleles or the mutation rate, those sound very measurable.
*  If I were a positivist, I would say that's good.
*  I can see what's going on there.
*  But then you have some kind of model, some kind of theoretical framework that it fits into.
*  So you already talked about selection coefficients or fitness.
*  I mean, maybe explain a little bit more about what fitness is supposed to be and and how empirical are those ideas versus concepts we need to introduce to make sense of our equations.
*  One of the architects of population genetics, the Brit J.B.
*  Holden, once described fitness as a bugger.
*  It's one of those kind of central entities in evolutionary theory.
*  In many ways, you can say we are a kind of one trait discipline.
*  That is what matters at the same time.
*  It is awfully hard to kind of agree on a proper definition and even harder to measure in complex that really matters in natural population.
*  Usually we think of it as something along the lines of the genetic contribution that a given individual makes to the next generation.
*  So how kind of the genes in certain individuals, how much they contribute to the next generation.
*  But then we also talk about fitness of specific mutations.
*  So then we talk about things that kind of a genetic level.
*  We have a long debate whether it's best to define fitness only at the individual level or sometimes have notions where we also should account.
*  For the interactions we have with individuals around us, this notion of inclusive fitness.
*  And then even this is even before we try to measure anything.
*  So if you study evolution in the wild, for example, you want to compare if you have, say, you have sampled individual plants from two different populations and you put them in a third one and see which one has a higher fitness.
*  Well, then you often have to rely on something like number of seeds that they produce or maybe even something like size and all these kind of indirect measures of fitness,
*  which means that it is this central entity that has been a lot of both conceptual debate, how we should define it theoretically, but also kind of debate about how do you measure it and what are good kind of indirect measures.
*  Because that's usually what we have to rely upon at the end of the day if you want to study it in natural populations.
*  When I wrote my book, The Big Picture, I talked about fitness landscapes a little bit.
*  I talked a little bit about evolution.
*  And when I ran it by some biologists, some thought it was fine.
*  Others were like, why are you talking about fitness?
*  This is an outmoded concept.
*  We can't measure this.
*  This is it's one of the they thought that it was one of those things that gives you the illusion of understanding.
*  But when you get right down to it, it's hard to really quantify in a reliable way that everyone would agree on.
*  Yeah, I think it's often like to do it well.
*  You would have to keep track of the features, not only of the focal individual that you're interested in, but also of others in a population in a way that's really quite hard in the long run,
*  especially if you study anything other than plants or kind of things in the lab.
*  Like you can do it really well with fruit flies or microbes in a kind of controlled lab setting where you can keep track of anything.
*  But if like I do believe that at the end of the day, what truly matters in biology is try to understand organisms in natural populations.
*  It is much harder.
*  Well, for one thing, there are things like floods and earthquakes and asteroids hitting the planet.
*  And it's hard to predict ahead of time what your fitness is going to be in those circumstances.
*  Yeah, yeah. Pandemics.
*  OK, so but anyway, to get back to the main line of thought here, we've mathematics a little bit of population genetics on the basis of the modern synthesis.
*  And what we realize, correct me if I'm wrong, my impression from looking at your book and other places, is that it's not just about me and my offspring.
*  In some sense, if you can speak of these goings on in slightly overly anthropomorphic language,
*  what wants to happen is that your genetic heritage wants to be shared.
*  And one way to do that is to have kids.
*  But the other way to do it is for your brothers and sisters to have kids.
*  Right. And so we get the idea of kin selection and inclusive fitness.
*  So this is this is kind of an insight that appears perhaps in the generation after the architects of the modern synthesis.
*  So in the 1960s and at the heart of this is this English biologist, William Bill Hamilton,
*  who already as a struggling graduate student writes these two tremendously important papers,
*  one published in 1963 and the other is a two part majestic piece in the following year in 1964.
*  And there he introduces both concepts, both kin selection, which is not a term that he coined, but it was coined by someone else.
*  But which is simply the idea that selection involves you and the relatives around you.
*  But at the heart of it was his idea of inclusive fitness.
*  And to kind of get a sense of why he thought we needed an update of the basic notion of fitness,
*  you have to think of situations where the classic definition doesn't really work.
*  And those often happens in the context of social behaviors that we had we had known for a long time that in social insects like in bees and ants.
*  Most you have individuals that are completely sterile and instead devote their life to helping other members of the same population to reproduce.
*  The Queen. This is recognized already by Darwin, who described as is one special difficulty of his theory.
*  And what Hamilton realized that one way to explain this is to think of that you shouldn't just think about the organisms,
*  the offspring that a specific individual has, but should also account for other offspring that this focal individual is causal or responsible for.
*  And you should add those to our focal individuals fitness scaled by the relatedness that you have to those individuals.
*  So in a way that if your brother has it, that counts more than if your cousin does it and so on.
*  And then it also has to do this to do the math properly yourself and have to subtract from this sum the part of your or the focal individuals personal fitness that someone else is causal or responsible for.
*  And doing this kind of sums is where it can get messy pretty quickly, but that is basically the heart.
*  You end up with this quantity inclusive fitness that you can show that individual can appear to maximize that.
*  Then on the certain circumstances, inclusive fitness can be maximized, even though this individual does not personally have any offspring, but they can help enough others to do so.
*  And then still you can have the process work whereby natural selection maximizes a kind of fitness, but it's a new definition of it.
*  And this is kind of what emerged in the in the 1960s.
*  And thus the witty remark from JBS Haldane that he would lay down his life for two brothers or eight cousins, right?
*  Exactly, exactly. That is kind of predates actually this, but it's very much sums up the basic insight very well.
*  By the way, just for people who might get confused out there, I want to mention two things.
*  One is you mentioned William Hamilton, who is not the famous mathematician physicist William Hamilton, who lived 100 years before, who invented Hamiltonian mechanics and the quaternions and things like that.
*  Two different William Hamilton's.
*  Also, there are two different Sean Carroll's and there's a biologist, Sean Carroll.
*  When I got your book, I think you will laugh at this, when I got your book, I realized that this is a rare book, given that you wrote about levels of selection and sort of philosophical things that I care about, but also biology and evolution that the other Sean cares about.
*  This is the rare book that might have both of us in the index.
*  And indeed, there is one entry for Sean Carroll in the index, but it refers to two different appearances.
*  And one of them is about me and the other one is about the other one.
*  Oh, is that true?
*  That's great.
*  So it's a very Sean Carroll centric kind of topic that we're talking about here.
*  That's what I'd like to see.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So, yeah, we get the idea that the motivation for thinking this way, I mean, maybe the motivation is that it's true, but part of the motivation is we see in nature, individual organisms acting in ways other than just trying to have the most offspring as possible.
*  And maybe this can selection or inclusive fitness can account for that.
*  Exactly.
*  That has been a tremendously influential way to think and make sense of these observations.
*  It is also an approach that has been criticized from the get go, often from mathematically minded parts of the field.
*  And the kind of a criticism that continues to this day that the way that it's not as kind of mathematically robust of a construct as some people with a more mathematical strong background would like it to be given the centrality that it has in evolutionary biology.
*  Right.
*  It has kind of survived because it provides a tremendous powerful rule of thumb and a very something that kind of empirical biology and feel this can go out and try to guide their experiments and to kind of cut this long debate short.
*  In a way, my kind of impression of it is, is partly what you want models to do in evolutionary biology, how kind of comfortable you are with these kind of mathematical limitations, because at the end of the day, this kind of summing up what at the
*  The additivity or summing up what you are responsible for versus other parts of the population often becomes prohibitively difficult in other cases than the most simple ones.
*  Yeah.
*  And similarly, you have to make assumptions about genetics and how strong selection are and so on to make it work.
*  But it has pointed us to something really valuable and that has one way to sum up is the third leg of the kind of Hamiltonian contribution to evolution biology is the kin selection, the inclusive fitness and sometimes what is known as Hamilton's rule that a trait will be favored if the benefit times the related is greater than the cost, which is kind of summed up in JB's holdings, lay down my life with two brothers, rate, cousin, quip.
*  The cost being that he would lay down his life.
*  Exactly. And that as a guiding principle has been very helpful.
*  Okay, but I mean, are you alluding to the criticisms by mathematicians in that? Are you alluding to Martin Novak and Tarnita and Wilson? They had this paper about group selection and use sociality a few years ago that really stirred things up.
*  It really quite did. And I thought in some ways quite exciting way. I had just started graduate school when the paper came out. And so it's kind of been with me.
*  Your whole life.
*  Ever since it was kind of one of the first paper we read in Journal Club when I was a new graduate student and I kind of was really taken by these kind of conceptual debates and really kind of reinvigorated my interest in that part of the field. So they in some ways represent the latest iteration of the debate.
*  They are far from the first to make these kinds of criticisms of inclusive fitness.
*  They were kind of made from the get go in a way that given the centrality that is taken, it's not as mathematically robust as you would want it to be.
*  But it's a debate that perhaps has calmed down a little bit the last few years. And I think we are in the field once the dust has settled is better off.
*  I think we're kind of more on the same page of what the limitations are. And you can kind of have a more interesting discussion about when can you live with those limitations and when can you not?
*  And kind of what the benefits of the approach are. And then I think I'm quite comfortable with by all this. At the end of the day using different approaches depending on the kind of temperament and kind of what they want the model to achieve in a specific situation.
*  But I guess I'm kind of confused a little bit because the inclusive fitness idea. I mean part of what it wanted to do, at least in principle, was to explain not only why certain ants don't reproduce and nevertheless
*  contribute to the life of the colony, but also maybe even altruism and human beings or other other mammals and so forth.
*  It sounds like it is quintessentially mathematical. Like you, Hall Dane's joke is very mathematical, right? You know, two brothers or eight cousins. But you're saying that the criticisms have come from the more mathematically inclined? Why is that? Is that explicable?
*  So I think that there are parts of the concept is kind of that relatedness is going to be really important.
*  It's in a way mathematical, but it's also quite simple intuition. So it led a lot of kind of feel, like you can go out and measure what are the relatedness between interacting individuals in this specific population and kind of studying that in
*  specific population in the wild. You can do it phylogenetically by comparing if you look at this group of species that have developed this quite complex social behavior.
*  Do they have a population structure of higher relatedness? So you have interacting generally between relatives compared to this part of this group of speeches on another part of the phylogenetic tree.
*  That do they have less relatedness among interacting individuals? So it's kind of guided us a lot in those kind of approaches. And that kind of like kin selection ideas there, I think has been very mathematical, but they're not that not too complex in a way. They just kind of point us in the right direction.
*  Now to get inclusive fitness. So inclusive fitness has to its proponents, one of the kind of uniquely good property of it is that it's a property of the individual organism.
*  That is, and it can be modeled as a property that an individual organism should appear as if trying to maximize. And this is good, because then you can kind of treat it as the kind of design maximand of or the sign principle of evolution or natural selection.
*  That, and this kind of goes back to some part of evolutionary biology, kind of the key problem that we should try to explain is the appearance of the sign. That like the kind of the fact that organs appear so perfectly suited for the environment that they live in. That's kind of adaptation or appearance.
*  So that is the problem we should try to explain. And you then take a step back and say, in order to do that, we ought to have a kind of a principle that shows like what should organisms appear designed for. And so its proponents and inclusive fitness is that.
*  That organism should appear as trying to maximize that. And you can kind of derive a model by which you can get the expectation that that is what organisms should try to do, try to do in inverted commas. And that is that when you try to get inclusive fitness to have that property, that it should be both what should try and be maximized and be the property of an individual organism.
*  In order to get there, the maths is a little shakier in a way. You have to rely on more restrictions, either to get the work or the assumptions are considered to be almost the opposite problem. They're too general to really become useful, because they almost end up in this kind of truism where it's always true. But there is where I think more mathematically even more mathematically minded people have had these criticisms. And I should say, all of these people are at the maxi end of the spectrum within biology.
*  If you come there from a biologist by training interested in theory versus someone who has the original training in say maths or physics and then come into biology in graduate school or even later on, kind of degrees of mathiness.
*  But and so again, just to get the landscape as it were perfectly clear, is the alternative to inclusive fitness or is the alternative to kin selection group selection? Or is it more complicated than that?
*  I'd say it's a alternative. Historically, that is often been the kind of viewed as the two contrasts.
*  And what does it mean?
*  And selection, the group selection, again, is one of those terms that mean different things to different people. And that is part of the fun there, the problem. And it has historically kind of meant to slightly different things, again, coming back to how we measure fitness. So by now, so I say kind of historically, the first way we thought of group selection wasn't kind of
*  what is now often even by its proponents referred to as naive group selection is kind of fully that individuals may sacrifice their life for the good of the group, bringing for the good of the species. And that's often kind of done in a rather unreflexive kind of way.
*  But then you often define group kind of group fitness in terms of groups producing new daughter groups that like you've measured group is in terms of new groups produce.
*  Most today, most models of group selection. So if you just pick up a kind of one of the current journals and someone present the group section model, fitness is usually measured in terms of individuals producing other individuals, but that you account for some sort of group property, some part of the group that's not really reducible in a meaningful way into individual level, individual level properties.
*  That is what now these days meant by group selection. I can sometimes think that is a little unfortunate that that is known as group selection. But that is, you know, me and others lost that debate a long time ago, that this is what we've settled on as a field.
*  But those models can can can often account for the same things and often rely on similar kind of properties that a kin selection model would do. So one kind of observation or insight that in some ways calm things down in this kind of ongoing debate between inclusive fitness and group selection is that you can show that often they are kind of formally equivalent, but they give the same prediction.
*  And I think that that is a good thing to realize that often you have the same properties. There's an interesting kind of, I think, more philosophical point there that often this equivalence claim relies on generating rather abstract statistical models that you get almost quite far removed from the kind of course, the course of processes happening in order to achieve that kind of equivalence.
*  And I'm kind of a two minds of this sometimes I'm kind of think, oh, this is great. We've shown that their equivalent. Yeah, sometimes I'm a little concerned that like this equivalence relies on such an abstract notion and that surely we are interested in what causally happened in a specific event, whether it is better described in terms of inclusive fitness, which is an individual level property or in terms of group level properties.
*  Good. Well, this is that's perfect segue because I do want to finally hit the payoff here, which is that, you know, once you start thinking about things in this way, evolution in this way of population genetics and equating my life to that of an equivalent number of other people's sharing the same genome, that's when you get to the genes I view, right?
*  That's when it begins to make maybe make sense that what we should think of as competing in the world of evolution is different genes rather than different organisms.
*  Yeah, I think the kind of the origin story of the gene side view, which is a perspective that kind of really comes to his own in the 1960s and 1970s stand on the exactly these three topics that we have covered is a approach to evolutionary biology that takes adaptation as the central problem that we're trying to explain.
*  It builds on the insight from population genetics that evolution can be described as changes in allele frequencies.
*  And then you kind of deferred debate from which emerges is the one over group versus individual level selection or the kind of sometimes known as the broader levels of selection debates.
*  And in a way, kind of combines these three into one perspective, thinking that adaptation is what we are trying to explain and kind of then goes about thinking about when we say that adaptation is for for the good of something, what is that something?
*  And the answer to that then is the gene because genes then are conceptualized as these entities that are passed on intact from one generation to the next.
*  Whereas the kind of the main alternative organisms or sometimes groups don't have that evolutionary longevity required to play that role.
*  An organism by this reasoning is a unique combination of its genotype and environment and their interaction is here in one generation gone in the next, whereas a gene then is passed on.
*  So by this reasoning, the gene is ultimate beneficiary of any adaptation.
*  And kind of lastly, it does this kind of takes this insight from population genetics that evolution is this lineages of genes over generation.
*  But because it very much kind of emerge out of the story study of social behavior, the kind of group selection debate, it combines that with a formal kind of anthropomorphizing or gentle thinking.
*  I think if if I was a gene, what would I do in this situation?
*  And this is where it comes that we expect genes to behave selfishly and selfishly, simply meaning here, trying to maximize their own representation in the next generation.
*  And just to give credit where it's due, the idea obviously became famous and was developed by Richard Dawkins with the selfish gene.
*  But the it was essentially the idea itself was already there.
*  Yeah, so I think most of us learned about the genes that we've through the writings of Richard Dawkins, especially the selfish gene.
*  Ten years earlier, the American George Williams published a book called Adaptation and Natural Selection, which I hold as one of the most important books in evolutionary biology in the second half of the 20th century.
*  But this is a book primarily directed towards other biologists on whom it did have a kind of profound influence.
*  It really sharpened the discussion about adaptation and the study of adaptation.
*  But it's you had the kind of faith that successful academic books have is read by the peers and and and but not so much more.
*  Whereas, you know, there are few terms in modern science that have had the reach that that selfish genes has had.
*  But to say many of those arguments are there already ten years earlier, but they are laid out in an even more explicit and a much more forceful way in the selfish.
*  It's a much better title. Come on.
*  It's an incredible title.
*  And it matters, right?
*  Except that we're still arguing about what selfish and what gene that means.
*  That still works.
*  That's OK.
*  The purpose of the title is to make people buy the book.
*  So it's an incredibly successful title in that sense that you have to admit.
*  And just to be just to clarify what it means to say the sort of I like that you call it the the genes.
*  So what did you call it?
*  I've forgotten it.
*  It's a view.
*  Right.
*  So it's a little bit lowering the temperature a little bit from the selfish gene way of putting it.
*  But one distinction may be worth drawing is that when we say gene here, and correct me if I'm wrong, we mean the instantiation of every single copy of that particular gene in all the individuals.
*  That's the thing that is competing.
*  It's not like the particular stretch of DNA just in one cell or one individual.
*  Exactly.
*  Most of the time, that is indeed what we mean.
*  And they kind of the way the type, the gene type that is present in this all is copies in a population.
*  And you think of that kind of whatever that is, is trying to maximize his own representation.
*  It turns out that this way of thinking is kind of genes.
*  I view is very effective at also thinking of situations where indeed the material part of a specific genes are in conflict with other genes, but in a body.
*  What is known as the side of genomic conflicts in in biology, where kind of the fitness interests of different genes inside an organism diverge.
*  And this is kind of one of those empirical fields that really was stimulated by the shift in perspective from organism down to the to the gene level.
*  And one of the reasons why people got their hairs up on end a little bit and also one of the reasons why other people love the idea is because it does seem to anthropomorphize a little abstract notion.
*  Right. I mean, we Richard Dawkins and no one else believes that genes have attitudes or have selfishness or anything like that.
*  So the claim is purported to be that given this mathematical description of population genetics and kin selection, inclusive fitness, it is as if the genes are being selfish.
*  Exactly. I mean, the acid here is crucial, especially because I mean, selfish is, of course, a very loaded term.
*  I think Dawkins perhaps to serve some criticism that the use of the word selfish selfish even in the book slides a little bit.
*  What I mean, because on the one hand, you have selfishness in terms that all genes are expected to be selfish.
*  Yeah. Which and you can you can say that if something applies to everyone, how useful is the term to begin with?
*  Because you also then use the same word to describe individual organisms behaving selfish.
*  And you contrast that with them saying they're having altruistically or or mutual mutualistically.
*  And they're like something they used slightly slightly differently.
*  They kind of you kind of get it, but they also kind of slides somewhat.
*  And it is not even to begin with the kind of psychological motivations of of of genes or organisms.
*  Where again, we use the daily language in a slightly so related kind of way.
*  And is the genes I view or the selfish gene idea supposed to be exactly equivalent to the existing formalism,
*  but just highlighting things in a conceptually more clear way?
*  Or does it actually make slightly different predictions?
*  So most of the time, the idea is that it will be the same that often.
*  So kind of in the book that was followed up, followed, followed the selfish gene, the extended phenotype,
*  which kind of is the only book that Richard Dawkins wrote that was aimed at professional biologists.
*  All other books, as you know, has been for the public.
*  But the extended phenotype are for professional biologists.
*  And it comes with it's fully referenced as you can expect a book like that to be.
*  That being said, it can be as a book that can be understood by anyone kind of willing to make the effort.
*  But you get less for free. Yeah.
*  Compared to his other books.
*  But there he starts with kind of this nectar cube illusion that if you draw a cube on a paper with straight lines,
*  you can kind of often see from two perspective which lines come first, so to speak.
*  And he kind of would say that this is in a way is the gene centered versus the kind of inclusive fitness view of the world.
*  That there are kind of two ways of looking at the same thing.
*  And in many ways, that is the kind of prevailing attitude, I would say.
*  Early on in the selfish gene is written a bit more that like this is a kind of empirical rival to individual group level selection.
*  But I'd say most of the time is considered that it's equivalent to inclusive fitness.
*  And I do. There is an interesting kind of history about the relationship between the gene side view and inclusive fitness.
*  As far as I can tell, the very first time that a term selfish genes appears is in the notes that Dawkins developed when he was a graduate student.
*  And his PhD advisor was away on sabbatical and asked him to step in and lecture on animal behavior.
*  And it's in the mid 1960s. So the papers on inclusive fitness had just been published and Dawkins wanted to cover it.
*  But these are tricky papers to get right. So he had typed up his notes.
*  And then there he kind of explains the insight in inclusive fitness using this kind of gene centric approach.
*  We should expect genes to behave selfishly or trying to maximize their own.
*  That being said, while Dawkins has kind of viewed Hamilton as arguably the greatest Darwinian since Darwin,
*  he's also sometimes thought that Hamilton is one of those people who never really finished their own revolution.
*  And every committed fully to the insight that you should just get rid of the organism and go down to the genic level.
*  So the first answer is yes, they're most of the time equivalent.
*  I think the more the nuanced answer is that there's some kind of, I think, underappreciated tension between the inside view and the good fitness that sometimes I think ought to be explored more.
*  Well, so I was going to ask I was going to ask about how you could get new insights, even if they were exactly identical.
*  But maybe I'm not clear on how they're what the tension is.
*  Maybe there's rhetorical tension, but is there empirical tension?
*  So I'd say the tension arises that the way we can if you want to construct an inclusive fitness model, that is kind of an individual organism property.
*  And that often you have to kind of ignore things that happen inside of the organism that like that all the whole part of the organ share the same purpose that has a unity of purpose.
*  Whereas so I've done most of my empirical research has been on these examples of genomic conflicts, the situations where genes differ in their inner fitness interests, where that assumption breaks down that you don't have kind of all genes working for the same goal.
*  You have certain genes working for their own transmission, even if that comes at the expense of the thickness of the individual organism that cares it.
*  And these are kind of somewhat confusing in terms that they're known as selfish genetic elements, which is strikingly close to selfish genes.
*  But here selfishness is then used in a much more explicit way that they are selfish with respect to other genes of the same gene or indeed the thickness of the individual organisms.
*  I think I see. So the question is, who are the genes competing with? Is it other alleles?
*  I mean, the alleles that are competing. So they are competing with other alleles in other organisms.
*  Or if really they just want to pass themselves on, who cares if other ones are also passing themselves on? They might even fight against other genetic components of their own organism.
*  Exactly. And this is truly a weird and wonderful world.
*  And you have examples like so you have things like a meiotic drivers that so normally you expect that meiosis.
*  So the process of production of sperms and eggs is this kind of fair lottery that you have two copies of a specific gene like in humans and that each of them has a 50% chance of being transmitted every time you produce a sex cell.
*  But then you have these kinds of genes that can distort that process.
*  So in general, rather than ending up in 50% of the sex cells, they end up in 90, 95, 99% of them.
*  And this can they can then become very common in a population, even if that by doing so, they reduce the number of offspring or in other words, fitness of the individual in which this kind of distortion happens.
*  And you have almost any part of the mechanism by which you copy genes and put them into sex that has been hijacked by some sort of subgenetic element to improve their chances of being transmitted.
*  And I think these kind of things are make, in many ways make perfect sense from a gene center or a gene site view is often being considered kind of the perfect kind of empirical vindication of the the approach.
*  And I think this kind of the tradition in evolution about the that emphasizes the individual organism too much, which I think I put inclusive fitness in that category often has to downplay the importance of this kind of phenomena too much for my liking.
*  It's not that you can't use those approaches, but in a way it's kind of a
*  An issue of temperament, I think, or what kind of what observation you think are important in trying to explain.
*  Well, it's interesting because I forget whether we said this explicitly, but one of the motivations or sort of paradigmatic examples in discussions of kin selection and inclusive fitness are ant colonies, right, where many individuals have no offspring, right, depending on what kind of ant they are.
*  You know, they work for the betterment of the colony. And the idea being that their genetic heritage is passed down by them serving their queen and their, you know, etc.
*  Even though they themselves don't have offspring. And so this is kind of a twist on that idea where you're saying that a certain gene can benefit itself.
*  It's maybe maybe it's the it's the it's the evil twin of that idea. A certain gene can benefit itself by shutting down some of the reproduction of reproductive capacities of an organism, but guaranteeing that its cells or its heritage will be passed on.
*  Yeah, and at the heart in some ways you're faced with the same kind of conceptual question and that you have an allele that is harmful in a way to the individual that carries it.
*  And you're trying to make sense of how can that ever evolve that kind of conundrum and like that happens when you have the evolution of sterility and work in your social insects and the situation of these kind of genetic conflicts or selfish unique elements that you have the spread of
*  And so how that how can we explain that evolutionarily. So to me, there's always been that kind of conceptual kinship between the two kinds of questions.
*  And even if to go back. Okay, so that was a very, very interesting example there. But even if the two views like Dawkins originally said are more or less equivalent, it still can bring conceptual insight if you have a different way of formalizing the same set of ideas.
*  And so by thinking of genes as the agents, in some sense, you think of all biology is slightly different, right? I mean, there's this whole vocabulary of genes as replicators and organisms as just the vehicles. All the organisms are our buses to carry on genes from generation to generation.
*  Yeah, in many ways, that is the central claim of the gene side view that evolution by natural selection requires two entities, it requires something to play the role of replicators, which is how information is passed on from one generation to the next.
*  And then something that kind of packages that and transport is around, and that is known as vehicles. And this is typically a role typically played by by organisms. But in principle, it can also be played by things like like a cell like in a situation like cancer, so that there you have kind of to break down
*  of you used to have kind of think of it as one vehicle. Now we have some vehicles that have broken out on their own competition. And in practice, you can in principle, it can also be something like a whole group could be could be the vehicle. But you're absolutely right. And in a way, like the choice of words here, it's important that vehicle is kind of inherently a passive term relative to the replicator, you kind of clear kind of what is valued in this viewpoint is the becoming a replicator and the organism is the replicator.
*  And so that's why the term in a way is downplayed. And they kind of Dawkins was part of formalizing this, but it's also the the philosophy of biology, David Hull, who kind of came up with same kind of way of formalizing the the insight of the genes have you, but he preferred to term interactor over vehicle because you think that by calling it vehicle, you're downplaying too much.
*  What's interesting about organisms.
*  So Dawkins famously said that he didn't call it a conditon vehicle not to praise it, but to bury it that he really wanted the field to move his focus down to some of my best friends or organisms, I do want to give them credit for, you know, for doing something playing some role.
*  But this is probably out of left field, but that distinction kind of reminds me of touring machines, a little bit, you know, the idea of some physical or even just, you know, touring machines is probably being too high brow about it computers, right, we have hardware and software.
*  I've always wondered going back to touring in his machines where he has an instruction tape and then some little head that goes back and forth and does the job.
*  How natural is this division of labor into sort of physical doer in the world versus instructions or information about how to do it. I mean, at the end of the day, it's all physical stuff.
*  So where and why and how universal is this distinction. It certainly seems central to the genes eye view.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting layer to that that Dawkins himself seem to be very taken by computers. He was one of the first to kind of learn how to program a computer at the department when he was still an active researcher.
*  And in several of his book, it does emphasize that genes or DNA is this kind of information, just like a CD or any kind of storage and then the organism is this machine that on which it just is runs.
*  There is a debate in philosophy of biology to what extent kind of the machine metaphor is helpful or not. And in the kind of thinking of organisms as machines, it goes back a long way.
*  And I think historically has been quite helpful. I'm I'm a little bit of too much because I think there is something interesting about organisms because on the one hand, of course, there are physical objects just like everything else.
*  As you say, there is subject to the same laws of physics like anything else.
*  There's nothing kind of magical about it. So there are physical objects just like anything else. At the same time, organisms are physical objects, unlike anything else, that they have this kind of like almost sometimes the sense of purpose and goal
*  or goal directiveness in them. And this is kind of what's given rise to kind of biology's uneasy relation with teleology. And how much should we allow ourselves to talk in terms of purpose?
*  And that is something that really runs quite deep in biology. You can rile up even the most senior and sober people on questions like this, whether this is an embarrassment that we talk in terms of purposes in biology.
*  Whereas others think that it's almost impossible not to do it, especially when we study animals and animals behaviors that kind of attempts to try to use some sort of language that's meant to be neutral.
*  It's not just unhelpful. It's downright silly. And press my my attitude is somewhat that you can there's has been this classic debate that the Darwin banished teleology from from from biology or did it naturalize it?
*  Did he make it okay by by kind of natural selection is a way that makes the cake is then you can talk about goals and purpose in terms of of fitness. And in a way kind of like, I think of the kind of inclusive fit iteration in a way coming from that naturalizing way that like he had kind of something that organism ought to kind of appear as striving towards.
*  There's no magic here. There's no land with how there's nothing kind of spooky going on. But you have kind of allow yourself to use a kind of language and otherwise isn't really okay in science. I mean, you don't really you don't use it in in physical chemistry.
*  And I think that's part of science that biology often looks towards. But biology, I think straddles this that is on the one end is a physical science, but the other hand is a behavioral science and it's awkwardly trying to balance the two. But it's certainly I think the part of science where purpose enters into our explanation in one way or another.
*  And I am on the view that we should just accept that but try to do it in a formalized or try to be so kind of as formal about it as possible in the way we approach it.
*  Yeah, good. I'm completely on your side. I have hopes to write. I've already written in various places toward this side that says that purpose and teleology can be naturalized. Basically, I would say not just because of evolution, but because of the arrow of time because of entropy increasing over time. But to do it, I say it can be naturalized. I didn't say that I did it or you know, we have a formal theory of it. And I think that that's something that is would be very interesting to understand better than we do.
*  Yeah, so a colleague of mine, Manish Patanai just submitted a paper where we try to defend what we call licensed anthropomorphicizing.
*  Oh, good.
*  Which is a concept that you're allowed to anthropomorphize. If I was a gene, I would do so and so. But then you need to back it up with a model, a mathematical model. And that is what provides the license. And it kind of just goes back to the inside this basic point that it's almost impossible to do biology without using this.
*  But we should try to do it then in a kind of an organized or licensed kind of way. And that we argue is kind of things like mathematical population genetics or other part of mathematical biology provides that license to do so.
*  I would say personally, the same exact things about free will. But let's not get into that debate right now. That's for another discussion.
*  Then there's that.
*  Let me give you one more chance, just in case we missed anything, to give good consequences of being a genes eye view person or selfish gene person. Are there other predictions that this viewpoint leads us to or other perspectives that are helpful to biology?
*  So I think that the genes have you is a it's a very powerful thinking tool in biology. I think it's one of the best tools we have to make sense of this messy world. But like with all tools to get the most out of it, you must understand where it came from and what it was what is trying to achieve.
*  So it's an approach to them to try to understand adaptations and kind of the logic of natural selection that can give rise to that. Yeah, so it works, especially well when those adaptations are kind of counterintuitive to the individual organism point of view, which has been the traditional focus of biologists.
*  So we talked a little bit about genomic conflicts, as I think is a great example of where that the benefits of the genes of you comes through the others in the study of social behavior, to understand what this real team, one that was kind of like a new thing that people will handle is the notion of extended phenotypes.
*  So these are defined as phenotypes that are located outside of the body in which the genes are kind of caught responsible for that phenotype reside. So kind of typical example has been the things that animals build, like the beaver's dam or the nests of birds. So you kind of structure that clearly has a genetic component to them.
*  But and so in a way should be thought of as a phenotype, but that the phenotype is not part of the organism. So do my way to do the clothes I wear count as my extended phenotype. So the incentives are typically considered to be to be part that has some influence on the fitness of the organism in kind of a consistent way across time and population.
*  I think it's pretty clear that how well people dress has an impact on their reproductive success.
*  It do though. Humans are famously and I have heron species to study.
*  I'm just gonna leave this on radical grounds. Don't worry.
*  Yeah, yeah. But those kind of build structures of animals, I think that kind of thinking of those in turn from a genie point of view, I think help stimulate that also kind of individuals where individuals of one species can manipulate the behavior of another.
*  So kind of this gruesome example like zombie ants, where ants who are infected by a particular kind of fungi completely changed their behavior from kind of shying away from parts of the planet where they live to go where it's beneficial for the for the fungi to live and eventually kind of end up behaving completely bonkers because they've been infected by these, these fungi and here so that again, that is a behavior of the ant that has a genetic component, but it deems the
*  behavior of for that for if you will, if you allow us up a shorthand for that behavior is not located in the end is located in another organism.
*  And that again is something that is kind of extended phenotypes are I think easier to think about from a genie point of view than trying to shoehorn it into that of the individual organism.
*  So let me let me bring up that not everyone agrees right like this is why you wrote a book because there are skeptics and critics of the genes I view point of view.
*  And at least I mean hopefully you'll fill me in on what all of the critics are the most important critics are but one of them is that even the modern synthesis is no longer how we should be thinking about evolution right I mean there's horizontal gene transfer there's epigenetic
*  factors the whole idea that there's just a simple tree and things branch off and never cross pollinate has been become a lot messier in recent years there's mitochondrial DNA as well as nuclear DNA.
*  So is there any legitimacy to this idea that the genes I view is just a codification of a very old fashioned way of thinking about evolution.
*  The genes I view certainly shares a lot with the modern synthesis, but you kind of ideas that adaptation natural selection are important and kind of framing that in terms of genes.
*  But there are a couple of things I think that are worth mentioning here so one that the modern synthesis is perhaps more diverse than what critics of it gave it credit for there's often presented as this very kind of strict dogmatic viewpoint which it wasn't included many different kinds of people with many different kinds of views.
*  Second world criticism of it has existed pretty much as soon as it was kind of codified or kind of as a big team expressed that often of the nature I think of people not really thinking that what they studied got to this, the respect that it deserved.
*  And this has come different kind of versions of this over over time. I think it is interesting both Richard Dawkins and George Williams so the kind of the two architects of the Dean's view did emphasize that they what they were doing is was to kind of articulate the kind of orthodox view in a new way that they kind of very much align themselves with that kind of traditional approach.
*  So the larger criticism of the modern synthesis and the inside view often is taken to be kind of the poster child of that is that biology has changed so much that is all way of thinking about is no longer helpful.
*  Right. And yeah, this is a contentious topic and and and and I think many sensible people can disagree on it. I don't tend to think tend to view this this new observation as being lethal to the modern synthesis.
*  Anyway, I think it's more than this is also quite a flexible framework and evolution by all is not as dogmatic as even its internal critics would like to present it. There's been quite a lot of incorporating it.
*  We are probably putting too much emphasis on certain things and not enough emphasis on on other things. And perhaps the kind of the greatest challenge I think to the Dean's side view is this notion of that we ought to consider a more inclusive notion of inheritance that we are giving genes too big of a role in that that
*  parents pass on more to their offspring than their genes. So this can be things like epigenetic signals, methylation patterns, but also kind of cultural cultural inheritance and other kinds of maternal effects.
*  So that I think there may well be some truth to one thing that I would call it like to see. I don't know if anyone has done is that the reason why the jeans have you proponents like to talk about replicators rather than genes.
*  If that replicators is completely divorced divorced from any sort of material basis, and that what really matters is that it can make copies of itself. So I wonder how some of these kind of other forms of inheritance can that can that be incorporated into this kind of traditional frame framework.
*  I mean, certainly, Richard Dawkins is in favor of thinking about memes as an important method of cultural transmission.
*  Yeah, I mean, memes also is I think it's interesting is of course it was coined in the last chapter of the first edition of the selfish gene, it was meant to kind of free replicator from the kind of association with genes in a way.
*  And that was the idea that if organic evolution requires something to pay a replicator and a vehicle. So should cultural evolution.
*  Ironically, though, I think that the despite wanting to free itself from the material basis of genes, it is actually exactly those kinds of properties that that makes the jeans have you work so well in organic evolution, but not in cultural evolution.
*  Yeah, that things that, you know, where does one gene start and the other one ends? How long is a gene? What does mutation actually look like or competition between alleles? What are really a lot of things that in organic evolution, we try to downplay some of those kind of properties.
*  But in a way, that is kind of exactly why it worked at the end of the day in organic evolution, but not in cultural evolution, where those boundaries become so poor is that I think I think to lose its value as a concept.
*  Yeah, a real biological gene is something at the end of the day, you can hope to point to there the DNA.
*  Yeah, it's anchored in some sort of material reality in a way that I think is hard to do in the means that so despite being a very successful meme in of itself. My impression is that it's influencing current study of cultural is somewhat limited.
*  That makes sense. I think I guess and this is a good place to sort of wrap up.
*  The part of the discussion that is that is most fascinating to me, it's taken us a while to get here, but it's the level of selection levels of description discussion, right?
*  One thing that one can say it's not a very useful thing to say, but one can say it is if I could be Laplace's demon if I if I knew the exact state of everything in the universe, and I knew all laws of physics and I had infinite calculational capacity, I could just tell you what was going to happen.
*  And I think an underappreciated aspect of that is that Laplace's demon doesn't need to know about cells and genes and organisms, right?
*  It just needs to know about the microscopic state of the world.
*  But I can talk about things in terms of cells and genes or organisms or societies, etc.
*  Is there how I mean this is a far too big a question to answer, but say what inspires you to say, what is the right way to think about the different levels of description that we have to capture biological reality?
*  And can they coexist or is there a best one that we should focus in on?
*  I think I very much come on the view these days that there isn't one best way to do it in biology.
*  I think that biology is a kind of science that is so messy and especially the part of biology like evolution, where we're trying to start a historical process that we are better off trying to retain multiple perspectives.
*  And that it's quite comfortable that some people prefer to model things in a group section way and some in an inclusive fitness kind of way and sometimes in a gene kind of way.
*  And that like that is not necessarily going to be a true answer that while there may be one, I don't know, meaningful necessarily to spend all our time trying to find that.
*  That being said, I think we ought to spend some time worrying about when we have two different kinds of approaches.
*  So one example is perhaps in population genetics and inclusive fitness methodology.
*  So inclusive fitness, you're often relied on these kind of optimization methods, quite popular in the study of behavioral animal behavior.
*  But optimization is also something that population geneticists rejected in the 1960s that we should never expect selection to optimize anything that is going to be in this kind of maybe equilibrium, but they're not going to be kind of optimized in any sort of meaningful way.
*  So some part of our field has rejected it and some uses constantly.
*  And I in some ways I'm fine with that. At some time, I think we ought to spend some time worrying about it.
*  But kind of on the larger philosophical point, I think that we have, you know, as you I think you have one reality, but you have many ways of talking about it.
*  And I think that becomes expressed very well on a day to day level in the study of biology.
*  Well, I guess the complication or the interestingness of the question comes in because, well, for me personally, I don't know about for the rest of the world, but since someone as someone who is trained on pretty cut and dried examples of different levels of descriptions, such as atoms and fluids, right?
*  We can literally derive fluid mechanics from large collections of atoms interacting with each other.
*  And we know that you don't need to understand atoms to understand fluids or vice versa.
*  So there's this almost too good to be true simplicity of autonomy of the different levels.
*  And I get the feeling I'm sort of slowly dawning to the realization that in biology and in the human sciences, that those levels are harder to disentangle from each other.
*  I think I think that is that is exactly right.
*  But you you have these kind of layers of descriptions that both can work really quite well.
*  So kind of the quantitative genetics that animal readers use, we kind of selecting on phenotypes and kind of know that there is heritability because you can compare parents and offspring.
*  But they kind of quite precise quantitative methods that you use there don't really care about the DNA sequences.
*  They can be informed by those. And I think like, you know, really advanced of what you know, sequencing and all that.
*  That part has also been improved, but it functions rather well without it as well.
*  But it's not that sort of thing. You can kind of derive those kind of phenotypic approaches from studying genetic sequences or vice versa.
*  It's not necessarily going to happen, I think.
*  And I don't really feel that pessimistic saying that. I think that's just kind of the nature of the endeavor.
*  So absolutely. I think biology is kind of perhaps where that kind of that you can derive one from that is starting to really break down.
*  Well, I think I think I certainly agree with that 100 percent. But there's sort of like a deeper, trickier issue.
*  I mean, I think far too much emphasis has been put on derivability because outside the very simplest examples, of course you can't derive.
*  I cannot derive the solidity of the table in front of me from the standard model of particle physics, but I don't think it's incompatible with that.
*  Right. But what is important, I think, or not as what is important, what I'm interested in at the moment is I don't need to know about the standard model particle physics to describe the behavior of the table.
*  There is an autonomous theory of it. And in biology, forgetting about derivability, it's not even clear to me that there's that. Right.
*  No, it's an interesting point. I don't thought about it in that way. But yes, I think there is there is less clear that you have that kind of asymmetry.
*  Yeah. No, I think I think that it's absolutely true that you can kind of go about it.
*  I mean, everything has to be compatible, of course, with what's going on exactly at the lower level.
*  But like how that how you begin to kind of worry about that, I think is less clear.
*  Well, I mean, I have I have an example in mind, which is very contemporary, which is the germ theory of disease. Right.
*  So, you know, we can have a theory of how diseases are transmitted through breathing and contact and things like that without actually knowing that they're microbes.
*  Right. You know, we don't need that lower level theory, but it is helpful.
*  And so I honestly don't know the answer to this question, but I would like to know, is there some sense in which there is a self-contained theory of, you know, let's say disease transmission that never refers to microbes?
*  Or if there is such a thing, is it so baroque and backwards that you should always you can always improve your description by just allow helping yourself to the microbial description?
*  Yeah, I guess part of the answer might lie in that like epidemiological models are in some ways very generic in the sense that you rely on like it just transmitted from one individual to the next.
*  But they can certainly be improved by knowing how it's transmitted.
*  So like learning that the COVID-19 virus is primarily airborne rather than like taking around on surfaces improves models, I think, in how you want to become more exact.
*  But you can certainly it's not necessarily you can do sound models, regardless of how that how they kind of transmission what is most important for transmission on this particular virus.
*  But it's going to wear one part where the biology of it matters or the kind of the little reality of it.
*  Yeah, I do think these are these are good questions.
*  We don't know the answers to yet.
*  So but I'll give you one last chance.
*  One final question.
*  What is all this bode for the future of evolutionary biology?
*  Like, it's interesting to me as an outsider to see the flare ups, not just intellectual, but emotional when things like the Novak et al paper came out about group selection or just the discussion around the idea of the selfish gene, you know, it gets pretty heated.
*  You've mentioned a couple times that data has sort of stepped in and and made things a little calmer.
*  Is that the future or are we still in for, you know, a whole bunch of heated debates and the pages of the New York Review of Books?
*  I think data certainly has helped a lot.
*  But there's also this issue that in evolutionary biology, we tend to have these flare ups over time.
*  There was a fun paper published a couple of years ago called what is wrong with evolutionary biology?
*  And it's that the argument there is that they think they're kind of two things that evolution by natural selection on the one and it's such an abstract principle that it can kind of be applied to almost anything.
*  But also that evolution biology is such a diverse field in terms of what we study.
*  So if you can't convince the paleontologist, maybe you can get the molecular geneticists to listen to you.
*  Maybe you can try the paleontologists and those two things in combination mean that you can always get a small enough audience to keep it going.
*  But you also may have a hard time explaining, kind of convincing everyone.
*  Kind of the key thing that I hope to achieve with this book is to bring some nuance to the debate over the gene side view that I noticed that one that people kept having these debates.
*  But also when I kind of when I was a graduate student, I would ask more senior people in my department about it.
*  You walk to one person and they will tell you, oh, yeah, this is this is the correct way to think about evolution.
*  And everyone knows that. And then you walk a few doors down and say, oh, no, this was debunked in the 70s.
*  And everyone knows. Right. And I kind of there was something there that I kind of was frustrated both by the proponents and the critics that often thought that they painted kind of an unfair picture of what the debate actually is.
*  Kind of strength of the case, both for and against this way of thinking about the evolution.
*  And so that's kind of what I wanted to capture really with the book.
*  Yeah, no, I think it's great. And I think this is extremely helpful conversation for me in clarifying things.
*  So maybe maybe whatever debates we have in the future, they'll be at least on a more informed basis going forward.
*  So Arvid Argren, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thank you very much for having me.
*  Thank you.
