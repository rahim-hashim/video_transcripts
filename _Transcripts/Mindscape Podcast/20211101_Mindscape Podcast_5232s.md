As the holidays approach, we are being reminded of the fragility of the global supply chain. But at the same time, the supply chain itself is a truly impressive and fascinating structure, made as it is from multiple components that must work together in synchrony. From building an item in a factory and shipping it worldwide to transporting it locally, processing it in a distribution center, and finally delivering it to an address, the system is simultaneously awe-inspiring and deeply dehumanizing. I talk with Christopher Mims about how things are made, how they get to us, and what it all means for the present and future of our work and our lives.

Christopher Mims received a bachelor’s degree in neuroscience and behavioral biology from Emory University. He is currently a technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal. He has previously written for publications such as Wired, Scientific American, The Atlantic, and Smithsonian. His new book is Arriving Today: From Factory to Front Door — Why Everything Has Changed About How and What We Buy.

# Mindscape 171 | Christopher Mims on Our Interconnected Industrial Ecology
**Mindscape Podcast:** [November 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rr2ytzYSE0)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Chances
*  are that the technology that you're using right now to listen to this podcast was built
*  somewhere else. It's very likely that whatever country the phone or tablet or computer you're
*  using to hear me talk right now was assembled in a different country than you're living
*  in right now. If not, then some piece of it was some dongle or some wire or something
*  like that. We take for granted that we rely on stuff, whether it's high-tech stuff or clothing
*  or everyday household appliances, that was built and manufactured and assembled somewhere else.
*  Since we've had a pandemic and we've been in lockdown, we've been increasingly used to having
*  stuff delivered directly to our door, whether it's books or groceries or food for the evening. This
*  is an incredibly complicated system as you might imagine. It's really kind of a monument to human
*  ingenuity that we've built a system of global commerce that really uses the whole globe. We
*  build things in one place, we get the raw materials in another place, we consume them in another place.
*  So how does all this work? This is the problem tackled by Christopher Mims, who is a journalist
*  at the Wall Street Journal in his new book called Arriving Today, from Factory to Front Door, Why
*  Everything Has Changed About How and What We Buy. I'm sure you remember the ever-given disaster,
*  right? Or at least snafu, maybe not disaster, but this giant container ship that got stuck in the
*  Suez Canal a few months ago and slowed down all of global commerce. So that's a reminder on the one
*  hand that there are fragile points in this system, but it's also just amazing to look at these ships,
*  right? These giant humongous vessels stacked with these containers, and these containers are part
*  of the intermodal transport system. The containers, the boxes that are on the ships need to be unloaded
*  incredibly quickly in some very busy port and then stacked onto trucks, trailers, and then taken
*  somewhere else, usually to be unpacked and put on different trucks. And all of this is just incredibly
*  interconnected, incredibly time sensitive, and it's still incredible flux. We're not done yet. We're
*  not done yet innovating how all this works. So the subject here is industrial ecology, how you build
*  the stuff, how you ship it, and the ways in which this search for ever more efficiency and productivity
*  have shaped how you work, how you work in a factory, in a manufacturing center, or also just in a
*  distribution center increasingly these days. And there's, look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's a
*  little dehumanizing. Some of these stories about what it's like to work in a distribution center or
*  work as a trucker or a driver for delivery service really call into question the job we're doing as a
*  society in providing people with good jobs that are fulfilling in different ways. And on the one
*  hand, let me say that a lot of the structure is invisible to most of us. If we're not in that
*  business or whatever, we sort of take it for granted and we think about us and them and it's a very
*  different world. On the other hand, I think and hope that there are people out there who are long
*  haul truckers or delivery people right now listening to the Mindscape podcast. And so this episode is
*  dedicated to you because you play a crucially important role in how our society as a whole runs.
*  And I would like your condition in life to be a little bit better. I'm not sure how much influence
*  I have over that, but it's something to shoot for. At the end of the episode, Christopher and I will
*  talk about ways we can improve the current system. There are things that are just inevitable, also
*  things that are our choices and we can make better. So we're going to try to figure out how to do that.
*  Let's go. Christopher Mims, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Thanks for having me, Sean. So I don't
*  want to actually accuse you of being responsible for the pandemic that we're all suffering through
*  right now, but it certainly is convenient that in the time when we're all reliant on things suddenly
*  appearing to our house from Amazon or from delivery services or whatever, you've written a book about
*  the process by which things appear at our house. How much of this is good planning and how much of
*  this is just the cosmic wheel spinning in unpredictable ways? It does make me question whether
*  I'm the only conscious being in the universe and I'm just manifesting all of this. It is absolutely
*  bizarre that on a whim, a super nerdy whim, I said, I want to understand where my stuff comes from.
*  This is almost childlike impulse. And then I was like, I'm going to write a long explainer of that,
*  a book length explainer of that. And in the middle of researching and writing it, the pandemic hit
*  and global supply chains seized up and then exploded. And then the debris fell over all of us.
*  And my reporting went on. And then suddenly I was reporting in the middle of that and having
*  absolutely surreal conversations with people responsible for cleaning up that mess,
*  which I'll never forget. From the point of view of the inside of this whole supply chain,
*  were there dramatic changes because of the pandemic or was it just more intensity to
*  get stuff to people? It's difficult to say whether the increased intensity
*  led to a qualitative change other than things just not arriving and stuff breaking down.
*  I think that the systems were initially in the pandemic really performing as designed and at
*  capacity. And so you had a lot of these supply chains have to be designed for their maximum
*  throughput, which is peak season, which is like when everybody's buying so much stuff for
*  holidays or whatever. And because of when the pandemic hit, we were actually in what is
*  traditionally the lowest point in terms of demand for the supply chain. So the supply chain was
*  ready in that sense. But the challenge has come since as that demand has ramped up. And honestly,
*  understanding the scale of that demand and why we're in this pickle that we're in now,
*  it requires a lot of macroeconomics because it requires appreciating that a few percentage
*  points movement from consumption of services to consumption of goods, along with a bunch of
*  changes in how we live and work leads to demand that so far outstrips the capacity of global
*  supply chains that you get what we're in the middle of now. And what really struck me about
*  reading the book, which I really liked is how much of the whole process that is required to
*  get the computer that I'm talking to you on delivered to my house is invisible in some sense.
*  We do take it for granted and there's a lot going on. Of course, it's obvious that there's a lot
*  going on. But when you dig into it, it's you use the phrase industrial ecology when we were
*  emailing about this. And it's extremely apt because it's not entirely or even mostly planned from the
*  top down, right? It's sort of a million different networks have to work together and they arise in
*  some somewhat organic way. Yeah, I'm currently just loving the Dickens out of the audiobook of
*  Merlin Mann's Entangled Life, which is about fungi and how we rely on them. And he studied
*  the ecology of these fungi in tropical rainforest where they are part of what is known as the wood
*  wide web. And they are communicating what are analogous to impulses in our nervous system
*  between trees, messages, also obviously transporting a lot of nutrients. And the global supply chain is
*  a lot like the network of my course that are underneath our feet and which 90 percent of all
*  plants depend on in that. Yeah, it is. It's not top down. The different segments kind of communicate
*  with each other at the point of, you know, a port or a warehouse or a truck as goods are moved from
*  one to the other. But each one of them is kind of self-contained. And it is also a distinct
*  marketplace. Like there's nobody who's cornered the market on ocean shipping or trucking or even,
*  you know, e-commerce as big as Amazon is. So every single one of these is a very complicated
*  marketplace where the price of everything is constantly changing. Obviously people buy
*  contracts for long term shipping. Like I want so many shipping containers on this ship six months
*  from now or whatever. But a lot of it is the so-called spot market. And that's what's been
*  going crazy because this ecology is just getting overwhelmed. And so of course, you know, economics,
*  it's also social science. The result is that, you know, prices go crazy or their shortages.
*  And there's so many different parts of this. I guess I want to start with my favorite part,
*  which is the shipping and the transport part. I mean, you mention right at the beginning of
*  the book something that is apparently a cliché or a standard story in your world, which I
*  not known about the fish. If you fish some salmon off of the coast of Scotland, maybe it's salmon,
*  maybe it's some other kind of fish. And then you buy it in a supermarket, cod, and then you buy it
*  in the supermarket in Scotland. Unbeknownst to you, it's visited China in between when it was
*  caught and when it arrived in your supermarket. Yes, it was frozen. It went to China, it was filleted.
*  And then it's shipped back, you know, in that same cold chain to Scotland because the cost of labor
*  is so much lower there. So it's like this 20,000 mile journey for your cod or whatever that
*  was caught very nearby. I think that that shows kind of the absurdity of global supply chains.
*  I mean, is it absurd or is it just really efficient? You know, before the pandemic,
*  there was enough capacity that it cost $2 to send a flat screen TV from a port in China to the port
*  of Los Angeles and the United States. Now, obviously, it only costs $2 because it's stuffed
*  with hundreds of other flat screen TVs in a big shipping container. But, you know,
*  what that cost doesn't reflect, of course, are all the externalities, right? Like all of the fossil
*  fuels, you know, all of the labor, which, you know, some of the workers in that supply chain
*  are working under less than ideal circumstances. You know, but it's kind of like we've got the
*  science, so let's do it. Like we have the technology. And of course, now we're in a
*  very different place where the cost of shipping that television is going to be 10 times what it
*  was before. So it may no longer be profitable to fillet that cod in China. And, you know,
*  the short term result is, well, maybe there's no filleted cod in your supermarket in Scotland.
*  I mean, there's all kinds of shortages happening in the UK now because of a trucker shortage.
*  You know, the long term is maybe people start to relocalize or, as they say, reshore those supply
*  chains. It would certainly be less absurd from an energy expended perspective. What exactly are you
*  referring to when you say that it will soon be 10 times as expensive to do that shipping? It is 10
*  times as expensive. Now the spot market for a shipping container, if you wanted to transport a
*  shipping container from, you know, one of the biggest ports in China across the Pacific to a
*  West Coast port in the US, usually it's the port of LA Long Beach, which is the biggest port in the
*  United States in the before times, it would cost you maybe $2,000. Now on the spot market, it'll
*  cost you $16,000, $20,000. It's so expensive that a lot of shippers have just thrown up their hands
*  and said, forget it, let's just put it on an airplane. But the problem is, because there's so
*  much less domestic, not domestic, international travel, a lot of that airplane shipping was just
*  in the spare capacity in the belly of passenger jets. So people are really stuck. But what is the
*  reason for this growth in cost? Is that the pandemic or something else? So this is the thing
*  that is difficult to appreciate. There has, what we have as much as anything, as much as we have a
*  supply of shipping crunch, we have an explosion in demand for shipping. This is because lockdowns
*  led so many more of us to sort of buy things via e-commerce, e-commerce supply chains are biased
*  toward, you know, things coming from China and East Asia and South Asia and Southeast Asia.
*  And in addition, there was this thing that happened where at the beginning of the pandemic,
*  shippers, truckers, etc. companies canceled their orders, because what they thought was going to
*  happen at the beginning of the pandemic was a sequel to the Great Recession, right? You know,
*  like where Lehman Brothers collapsed and all that. So everybody thought, oh, god, we're going to have
*  this huge recession. So let's pull back our orders. Let's not book anymore, you know, shipping
*  containers and trucks and whatnot. But instead what happened was you saw this huge surge in
*  demand, you know, and part of this is a big part of this is people just stopped going out so that
*  they just started buying stuff. Another part is, you know, obviously, like all those, the stimmies,
*  the stimulus checks helped. But I really think what happened more than anything else, and this
*  comes from recent reporting I've been doing talking to economists and stuff, people have changed
*  their lives more than we appreciate. So the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that only maybe 14% of
*  people are still working from home. But that could be an artifact of how they ask the question. If
*  you look at it, there's a Gallup data that came out yesterday, which says that the number is more
*  like twice that. So we may already be approaching the maximum number of people who are in jobs,
*  who can work from home, are working home part of the time. And what that's leading to is just this
*  huge lifestyle change. So one sociologist wonk person called it family insourcing. And I think
*  whether or not you have kids, we've all had the experience of being like, you know what,
*  I'm gonna do more stuff at home. I need a new set of knives. I need some outdoor furniture. I need
*  a desk for my kid. I need a webcam. And so that demand, and then the ability to do that spending,
*  because nobody's going to Disneyland or whatever, has just shifted so much spending to goods. And
*  those goods have to get into our country on shipping containers. And that whole system
*  is not designed to ramp up quickly. And it's impossible to ramp it up quickly. Because what
*  are you going to do? You're going to put in another order for another ocean going ship that's
*  literally three football fields long and 15 stories tall. Okay, great. Well, Hyundai Heavy
*  Industries will get you that ship right away in four years. So that's a big part of the problem.
*  What's the secret to your best night's sleep? First, toss out your memory foam and upgrade
*  to Awara, the luxury hybrid mattress with natural foam and New Zealand wool fiber. Awara features
*  premium Sri Lankan latex and wrapped coil springs to provide contour and a touch of bounce for
*  supportive sleep throughout the night. Awara is known for that weightless feeling. You get neutral
*  spine alignment, so no sinking or pulling on the natural curve of your back. Your weight will be
*  evenly distributed from head to toe with a touch of bounce you simply can't get with old-fashioned
*  memory foam mattresses. And there's a best in the industry 365 night trial, no questions asked. If
*  you don't like it, Awara will take it back even if it's 364 days later. For a limited time, you'll
*  get $499 in free accessories, two natural latex pillows, cotton sheets, and a waterproof mattress
*  protector with every mattress purchased. And feel good knowing Awara plants 10 trees with every
*  purchase. So sleep better knowing you just planted a small forest. To redeem, go to

*  Okay, good. So it's just supply and demand and the pandemic and this shift in lifestyle, which as you
*  note might not go back. I mean, I think just to sort of put things in context here,
*  over the course of this conversation, we'll be bumping into various horrific aspects of this
*  whole supply chain. But we do as consumers benefit from it. I mean, like you said, we buy stuff,
*  I mean, not only the obvious stuff, but I did upgrade my kitchen utensils during the pandemic,
*  because I was using them a lot more frequently, right? That kind of thing goes invisible, but
*  can definitely lead to a lot more demand. Yes. I mean, this is what economists call this
*  multiplexing, when one good can be used over and over again, and it's just a much more efficient
*  use of that good. And when we were all going to offices and sharing a coffee maker, we were
*  multiplexing that coffee maker. Well, now that we're all at home, well, you know, only coffee makers,
*  60 new coffee makers got ordered or whatever. So for every one that used to be in the office.
*  We all had this experience during the pandemic of watching on tenterhooks, the drama in the
*  Suez Canal with the ever given ship being stuck. And when that happened, like it sent me on a little
*  bit of a trip down the rabbit hole concerning containerization. And this is something that I
*  just become absolutely fascinated with. Like I could have the whole podcast conversation
*  about containerization, but we'll try to get to other things first. But the very idea, which I'm
*  sure I knew, but hadn't quite appreciated that those boxes, those containers that are on the ships
*  are the same boxes that are being pulled by trucks, right? Like it's literally exactly the
*  same box. You pick it from the ship, put it on the truck, put it on the train. And this is not
*  automatic or natural. It happened starting in the 1950s and it changed everything. And the word
*  container is not just a box containing things. It's a very specific kind of container, these
*  intermodal things that go on ships and everything. So I mean, put into your own words a little bit
*  about how that did change the whole supply chain that we rely on. Yeah. I mean, I think
*  containerization is actually a much deeper phenomenon because this is also how the internet
*  works, right? Like the internet, the underlying protocol, it turns data into discrete packets
*  that then are all handled the same, right? So anytime you want to create a system, whether
*  it's the internet or a network of fungi in the forest or a shipping network, you want to
*  containerize things so you have a standard thing that all the different modes of transport can
*  handle. And that's called intermodal, right? So a shipping container can go on a truck, on a ship,
*  on a train, and all of the cranes can be standardized, et cetera, right? It's like any
*  other standard, like the plug in your wall. If every electrical plug in every house was
*  putting out a different voltage, our modern world wouldn't work. So that standard came about,
*  as you said, starting in the 50s, really in the 60s, it picked up because there was this guy named
*  Malcolm McLean. There's an amazing book about him by Mark Levin called The Box. And he just had this
*  vision, let's stick stuff in containers that can travel between ships and trucks primarily.
*  And everybody was like, okay, we kind of agree with you. And we've experimented with this a
*  little bit here and there, but we have a different standard. These are the different dimensions of a
*  box that we want. And ultimately he won in no small part because the United States government
*  needed to move an enormous amount of material into Vietnam for the Vietnam War. So he got that
*  contract and they were like, cool, we'll use your shipping containers. It gave him enough
*  startup capital to build ships that were designed just to handle shipping containers
*  of a specific size that could then be unloaded by cranes of a standard size. And then before you know
*  it, those cranes were being installed in ports all over the US and then eventually the world.
*  And then what happened was people examined the throughput of these ports and it was so much
*  higher than the old way, because the old way was you have a bunch of barrels and sacks and God knows
*  what else. And then an army of men has to go into the hold of that ship and haul it out. It used to
*  take like two weeks to unload a ship. A containerized ship, even a big one, they can unload it in 24
*  hours. Yeah and a big one is really really big. Enormous 10,000 40-foot containers on the biggest
*  of ships. I said this earlier but it bears repeating. Three football fields long, 15 stories
*  tall. When you are next to one of these as I've been both on the water and on land, it really
*  feels like when you stand on a long block in New York City or Chicago or someplace like that
*  and you're just looking up at these kind of hulking buildings and there's a whole block of them.
*  Because they're literally as big as the Empire State Building laid on its side. And that is
*  the most efficient way to move atoms mass on the surface of the earth that we've ever invented
*  because of all the fun Newtonian physics of water and all the rest. Well and what's interesting,
*  one of the many things that are interesting to me about this is that there needed to be some kind
*  of phase transition. It's easy for everyone to individually load their sacks of grain onto a ship
*  but for the world to agree we're going to use this kind of standardized container, they might
*  all agree that if we all did that it would be great but someone has to do it first. And there
*  is very expensive when you first do it and basically like you say it was this one guy,
*  Malcolm McLean, he just really pushed for it. He was in the right place at the right time with the
*  Vietnam War contract and that changed the world. Yeah, I mean it's such a great argument in favor of
*  standards and open standards. It's on a par with Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web
*  and HTML and being like let's all agree that this is the standard and this is how we're going to
*  render web pages and everybody gets to use this and then we can all interface with each other and
*  then boom globalization. And the magic of the container is you know it gets loaded, I'm stating
*  this as a statement but correct me if I'm wrong here, like it gets loaded in Vietnam or wherever
*  and then it might not be opened or unloaded until it arrives at some factory or some facility in
*  Utah or whatever it just travels across the world and who knows what's inside, someone knows what's
*  inside but the people who load it don't need to know. Yeah, the only wrinkle I would add is that
*  a lot of those containers, unless they're traveling on a train because trains are so so efficient,
*  will actually be unloaded not that far from the port and then put into all the contents will be
*  put into the back of a semi-trailer and the reason that happens is containers are heavy.
*  Because you know they have to withstand an ocean traveling across the ocean so for that reason,
*  just to save on fuel and all the rest, a lot of containers get emptied in these vast warehouses
*  that are kind of invisible to us in California's Inland Empire let's say and the materials cross
*  docked as it's put into the back of a long haul truck because the semi-trailer is super lightweight,
*  it's very thin, it's very, I mean it's strong because it's got a metal frame but it's
*  very very very thin and lightweight. Yeah, so I feel like when I'm driving around LA,
*  I'm at the center of global commerce sometimes and I've noticed since I became fascinated by
*  these containers that some trucks are really, they're clearly containers and some are not and
*  what you're telling us is that there is sort of an economy to only actually lugging the intermodal
*  container a short way before you distribute it to more efficient ground transportation system.
*  Yeah, yeah exactly and again the exception of that is trains and we shouldn't forget that
*  by ton-mile we move almost as much material in the US by train as we do by truck. It just
*  tends to be different stuff, it's like commodities or you know frankly a lot of it's coal.
*  Yeah, okay. But yeah a lot of that stuff gets put into a different kind of box when it goes
*  on the back of a truck. And is there some feeling for you know the most important or popular trade
*  routes and the most important kinds of cargo? I mean obviously it's everything in some sense
*  but is it dominated by a small number or is it really just this network that you know every
*  big city has a port and it connects with every other big city? Well this is the thing that's
*  interesting about containers and containerized shipping is that it exactly maps to the pattern
*  of global trade right? So we have a big trade deficit with China right? We buy way more than
*  from them than they buy from us. But what does that actually look like? Well the physical reality
*  of it is shipping containers worth of goods. That's why so many full containers across the ocean
*  from these giant ports in China. I think the seven biggest ports in the world are all in China.
*  Across the Pacific to the port of LA, Long Beach. I mean there's also they can also go to Oakland or
*  ports in Canada and places like that or they might go around and go to like Savannah. But
*  then one of the challenges we have right now with global shipping is that
*  what we're selling back to China is you know a lot of it's like intellectual property
*  and software and cloud services. Things that do not need to go into shipping containers.
*  So then the problem is well you got all these empty shipping containers like who's going to
*  ship them back? And remember like we talked about earlier there's no top-down authority that's like
*  I wave my fiat wand and say all these empty shipping containers need to go back on another
*  route. Like they take a kind of more tortured route back to China and so that's why there's
*  this imbalance. Just as we have a trade imbalance there's this imbalance of containers
*  and people are like oh crap we don't have enough containers and China's like oh crap
*  we're making containers as fast as we can but there's this terrible inefficiency in the system
*  where it's like we have a lot of containers they're in the wrong place. Like somebody's
*  got to figure out how to get these back and we have ways to get them back. It's just that those
*  are broken like so many other parts of the supply chain. And is there a simple way of characterizing
*  the sense in which China is the center of a lot of this? Is that there I mean you know are t-shirts
*  and everything say made in China but is that just because labor is cheaper? Is it going to continue
*  that way? My feeling is that China is trying to sort of upgrade their job force to go from mindless
*  labor to other kinds of things. So will it is it a temporary thing where all these things are made
*  in China and soon they'll be made elsewhere? So it started because China had a cheap labor
*  but also it's just a big centrally controlled economy where the communist party can just sort
*  of dictate like well we're going to prop up this industry or we're going to build these kind of
*  factories or whatever. But even as wages rise in China there is a stickiness to things still being
*  made there because it requires expertise to make many things in our modern world. They're very,
*  very complicated. So even if manufacturers would like to move the manufacture of say consumer
*  electronics from China to Southeast Asia or even you know South Asia, they have to do it one piece
*  at a time starting with the least complicated part of that process which usually is the assembly by
*  hand of the iPhone or the Samsung phone or the AirPods at the end of that manufacturing process.
*  But those microchips and like other you know tricky to make components they may still be made
*  in China and then shipped over there in order to because that's where the expertise is right.
*  And the funny thing is that like expertise you know it's like water or something like it sort
*  of like accumulates in these unexpected places. It turns out that Malaysia is where the world's
*  microchips are packaged and packaging a microchip means taking that silicon chip and putting into
*  the little thing that you've seen when you've like busted open an old computer where it looks
*  like a bug and it's black and has little legs which are you know the electrical connections.
*  Chip packaging is really important. That's done in Malaysia. Malaysia had a bunch of shut downs
*  recently so it caused another kind of mini chip shortage not because there weren't enough chips
*  but because there wasn't enough capacity to package them in Malaysia. So what ends up happening is
*  even as China is trying to move up the kind of scale of development to you know more
*  like you know software engineering or whatever else production of cultural capital whatever it
*  is that the US is doing. You know there is that stickiness and it tends to have this
*  effect of just lengthening supply chains and making them even more complicated and more
*  vulnerable. Like it's a bit comical like that's not the only effect it has because because people
*  who do logistics for a living get wise to this and are like hmm we really should spend the extra
*  money required to like vertically integrate this all on our shores. But that's been the near term.
*  It's a very interesting point the combination of the fact that expertise pools in certain geographic
*  locations plus the fact that shipping is relatively cheap right. I mean that's the lesson of the
*  of the cod from Scotland creates this absolutely Byzantine network that I think that we're not
*  usually aware of how many trips the individual pieces of something have to make. You know like
*  it's built somewhere packaged somewhere else you know put in a cardboard and plastic container
*  somewhere else etc before it gets to us. It's just cheaper to do things in different parts of the
*  world than to build a I don't know a factory or whatever it is a facility locally. The shipping
*  is the easy part. Yeah and there's so many fascinating examples of that you know and the
*  more complicated the object the more of those dependencies it has. I mean one of my favorite
*  examples is like okay let's say you want to build like the CPU of a smartphone or whatever. Okay
*  starting point if we're not going to go back to the birth of the universe is
*  is ultra pure quartz sand in of all places Appalachia. Now that quartz sand is going to
*  get transported somewhere where it can be melted down and grown into a crystal. That could be
*  Australia. Now that incredibly pure crystal of silicon is going to be transported you know
*  elsewhere. It could be another country but let's just say it goes to Taiwan then the crystal is
*  sliced into wafers and then you know TSMC's fabs in Taiwan it's etched. Now those chips are broken
*  up and as we just discussed they're packaged in Malaysia and then they're going to get transported
*  to Shenzhen where finally they're going to get stuck into a phone. That is the trip just to get
*  this thing assembled. Oh and by the way it might then travel from Shenzhen to like India because
*  so much phone assembly is being done there or in Vietnam and then it's going to cross the ocean
*  to us. So just imagine like if you were trying to design the most Rube Goldbergian and the most
*  vulnerable to trade wars, actual wars, global pandemics. I mean honestly it is a miracle
*  that we haven't run out of everything by now. When you think about it it shows that there is
*  a lot of flexibility and elasticity in these markets. Yeah no but it does seem very fragile
*  in a way. I mean that's the difference I guess with a biological network. A biological network
*  you compared it to the fungi etc or the networks in our bodies but they're sort of evolved to be
*  resilient right because you know whatever kind of redundancy that is useful to survive a little bit
*  longer might be selected by natural selection. Whereas here this is one global supply chain
*  and you can imagine there are critical points where it could break down catastrophically.
*  Yeah I mean like you're a student of evolution. I mean you know that one of the major reasons
*  that we think species go extinct is that they over specialize and then the ecosystem changes
*  and then it's like boom adios like you're the dinosaurs the asteroid just arrived like see you
*  later. You know and then the the weed species of the world kind of take over. So yeah I mean I
*  think that this whole system is in a place now where people are recognizing these vulnerabilities
*  like the Tim Cooks of the world have like woken up and that's why to go back to microchips you have
*  Intel and others being like you know we're going to spend I forget the figure it's tens of billions
*  of dollars to build more fabrication capacity in the US. TSMC which is you know they make almost
*  all the the high-end chips that we all rely on. They're building a new fabrication plant in Japan
*  they just announced. Interestingly that plant is not for the latest generation of chips it's for the
*  old chips that the automakers need and and can't get enough of. So people are kind of saying oh
*  this needs to be more resilient and the one way that you build resilience of course is redundancy.

*  already mentioned very briefly but clearly is an overarching theme in the book which is time,
*  saving time, making things happen as quickly as possible and you mentioned the chaos, not the
*  chaos, but the activity at a port like Long Beach or LA or Shenzhen or whatever and it's kind of
*  awesome to behold. You see these pictures of you know what looks like acres of shipping containers
*  lying on the ground and I read an interesting statistic here that the average time to unload
*  a container from a ship in North America is 76 seconds. In Northern Europe it's 46 seconds
*  and in Asia it's 27 seconds. So I thought 76 seconds was pretty good but they're even much
*  faster in Asia. So it reminds me a little bit of you know trying to get to a sports stadium for
*  the big event or trying to park at an airport where you have many many people trying to
*  converge on a tiny place and there must be both science and engineering that goes into
*  figuring out the most optimal way to get this stuff to happen. Yeah and there's a lot of fun
*  math which I think you probably enjoy. You know like it goes back to I think it was I think it
*  was Claude Shannon and you know having to the problem of figuring out how big of or how many
*  I forget the name of them the people who like used to direct phone calls in the old days.
*  Yeah or switchboard operators. Operators. How many yes how many switchboard operators do you need
*  so that you know x number of people in a town will be able to connect 90% of the time and that
*  turns out to be this really interesting mathematical problem and that kind of math which among other
*  things led to so-called queuing theory which is literally the math of waiting in lines is absolutely
*  integral to the entire supply chain because everywhere you go in the supply chain everybody's
*  waiting in a line you're a ship waiting off the shore to get on in and then you know once you pull
*  these containers off as quickly as possible and maybe you're using robots to help you do that
*  faster now you have a whole new queue every terminal in a port is just a big messy three
*  dimensional line queue where you know containers are stacked on top of each other and they're
*  moved around and they need to be in the right place which is on top of a stack not that far
*  from the far side of the terminal on the at the moment that a truck pulls up to grab that
*  container and then cart it off you know to a to a warehouse and the thing is if you fully unloaded
*  a modern container ship I did the math it's in the book and I can't remember exactly the math
*  but if you fully unloaded a modern container ship and you allow a reasonable distance between the
*  trucks doing it the line of trucks would be like 50 miles long that's the length of your queue from
*  one ship per ship and so now you can you can see the the sort of challenge of making this work and
*  you can also see the value of why so many ports are turning to automation to do things like
*  groom the the yard of containers which just means rearranging them continuously with these big robots
*  so that the containers are kind of moving through with the least number of total moves smoothly
*  from where they're pulled off the ship to where they're put onto a truck and that's just one of
*  the queuing problems right and there's queuing problems throughout the whole thing and it's
*  nevertheless a interplay of human judgment and automation like you have this fascinating story
*  of just piloting the ship into the port right like there needs to be a highly paid ships pilot
*  who is local to the port who goes on a little tugboat or whatever climbs onto this big container
*  ship and then pilots it in yes i mean the harbor pilot thing blew me away because
*  this the simplest way to put this is that for every for 90 percent of the stuff that you own
*  which comes on ships 90 of everything as rose george's book is called someone had to risk
*  their life at least at that one moment to get it to you and what i mean is that to transfer
*  the specialized pilot who knows how to navigate that giant ship into the very tight confines of
*  a port that person had to you know motor out to that giant container ship on what's called a pilot
*  boat and then because the pilot boat's so tiny and the ship is so big and there's this ocean swell
*  happening they have to time it just right where the two ships are moving up and down and with a
*  different period and kind of nimbly hop from the deck of the pilot boat onto what to this day is
*  still a rope ladder and then they got to scramble up the rope ladder before the swell of the ocean
*  catches them because if they get sucked under their survival rate is like zero so over the
*  course of a harbor pilot's career there's a one in 20 chance that they'll die on the job well
*  and these are not people who are disposable in any sense i mean no human life is disposable but
*  in terms of their expertise because these are the most experienced pilots in the world they have to
*  be a an ocean going pilot for years and years generally and then they have to pass this insane
*  test that's like the test that cabbies have to pass in london to become cab drivers the knowledge
*  where they literally fill out by hand a giant paper map of the port that they're going to be
*  harbor piloting in and it takes them like six hours to write in all the features and the depths
*  and the hazards so the things that they do in terms of steering this boat are are just unreal
*  you know because it's it's something with the mass of a skyscraper and you know the tolerances
*  as they go under a bridge or the tolerance between the bottom of the ship and the bottom of the ship
*  channel could be like a meter and then they've got to get it right by the um quayside to within
*  a meter or two of where it's supposed to land between two other ships that they don't want to
*  crash into so that the electricity and the fuel can be hooked up properly so it's just like crazy
*  it's like stunt driving but with a skyscraper and it doesn't seem like the most rationally
*  designed system in the world i mean are ports constantly being reinvented to be better or are
*  they just sort of scrambling as fast as they can to keep up with the changing global supply chain
*  i think that they there is an element of scramble but the thing is that ports are public infrastructure
*  so you know it's not like amazon's like oh we need a bigger port i mean we might get there
*  but you know the what happens is you get billions of dollars of public investment by you know
*  let's say the state of california in this case or the cities because they know that they're going
*  to recoup it because of taxes and economic activity but like you know that kind of investment
*  and expansion takes decades in order to make these you know the challenge they have now is that
*  because it's more efficient and cheaper for the ocean shippers these uh container ships have just
*  gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and now they're really at the limit of what these ports can handle
*  i could talk about the shipping in the containerization forever so like like i said
*  but uh we should shift gears a little bit to the the manufacturing side of things and as you point
*  out in the book you know this the issues that were always there in the factories on the
*  manufacturing side of things are now there at the opposite end of the supply chain in the fulfillment
*  centers right i mean it's a very it's full circle kind of operation but tell us about frederick
*  winslow taylor because here's another thing where if you're in the business this is just like he's
*  super famous everyone knows him it's like who's einstein but if you're not in the business you've
*  never heard of this guy yeah when frederick winslow taylor he's like you know he's like uh
*  what you know what carl marx is to communism i think taylor is to to modern uh kind of technological
*  industrial capitalism but his name is not familiar because his ideas have become the water that we
*  swim in he was really the first management consultant and he he invented this whole idea
*  of like time and motion studies and speeding up the labor of people who are in jobs that involve
*  a lot of routine like manufacturing that's where he started and of course you know should be stated
*  that this was uh one of these moments in history of like dual discovery like newton and leibniz both
*  coming up with calculus around the same time because at the same time that taylor came up
*  with all of his ideas henry ford was and his team was coming up with the same ideas in order to
*  get employees to be able to keep up with the pace of the assembly line which he had just invented
*  or borrowed really from slaughterhouses so taylorism is just this idea that you can you can
*  break down you know a job into these minute tasks time every single one of them and come up with
*  better ways to do it and what it leads to is the speed up of work and the way that taylorism was
*  implemented back at the beginning of the 20th century workers found it so brutal that at the
*  watertown um armory where it was implemented by the u.s government a bunch of them went on strike
*  and then there were congressional hearings and congress declared that taylorism could never again
*  be used um like anywhere in a federal facility which is ironic because again now it's kind of
*  like the way that everything is run the modern day version of it i call bezo'sism and bezo'sism
*  is just what's what happens in amazon fulfillment centers it's taylorism it's the ideology of
*  taylorism kind of carried down to us through a bunch of other management consultants combined
*  with very sophisticated systems for observing in real time every single thing a person does right
*  technological surveillance and then once you have all that data you can manage people by algorithm
*  right so if somebody falls behind in an amazon fulfillment center it's not their boss who's like
*  hey work faster went back in the days of taylor it's an algorithm and it just says hey you spent
*  too much time off task or it says hey this is your third warning in two weeks you know this algorithm
*  is going to write you up and then you're going to go talk to your human manager um so management by
*  algorithm obviously you see that everywhere now you see it in um the way that like uh shifts are
*  scheduled at you know fast food restaurants the way that um the pace of work is regulated at fast
*  food restaurants the way the pace of work is regulated at call centers um obviously the way
*  amazon fulfillment centers are run and you know part of the kind of great resignation we're seeing
*  now i think is people rebelling against that style of work because it's you know everybody has a bad
*  day but if your manager is an algorithm there's no button you can press on your app to be like i'm
*  having a bad day give me a break well that's what's so crucial about this moment when taylor
*  comes along and i mean i think that you're right the impression i got from reading your book is
*  that henry ford obviously played a huge role here but the most striking thing about taylor's
*  way of doing things was rather than just telling workers okay this is your task now do it and even
*  more than just saying do it fast or we'll fire you or whatever it was this observation of you know
*  looking at different workers doing it different ways figuring out what was the most efficient way
*  and then not just telling the workers to do it but do it in this exact way with this exact sequence
*  of movements so on the one hand it makes things a lot more productive efficient on the other hand
*  it does leech the humanity out of the human being that is actually doing this task yeah everything
*  depends on how much agency that worker has so i had a really interesting conversation with you know
*  sociologists and labor economists and they pointed out that there are industries like automobile
*  manufacturing where you know obviously workers are unionized so they have a lot of say over the how
*  their work is done where those workers when sort of presented with hey here's the way to make your
*  work more efficient what do you think about that and they can push back on it and be like well this
*  part isn't safe or this part isn't sustainable you know telling people hey let's make work more
*  efficient and safer and more humane everybody most people will sign up for that but when workers have
*  no agency then what can happen is what we've seen in amazon's warehouses where the pace of work and
*  the repetitive nature of the work which is a directly a product of the automation that's being
*  incorporated into that work leads to things like so-called musculoskeletal disorders i.e. you know
*  like carpal tunnel syndrome whatever because the human body was not designed to do this exact same
*  action i know your viewers can't see it but i'm picking objects off of the shelf in an amazon
*  warehouse as quickly as i can and repeat that action over and over and over again i mean we all
*  know anybody who's done any athletic activity that your joints are going to give out if you
*  do the exact same thing over and over again for 10 hours a day every work well you mentioned the fact
*  that there is a correlation between increasing automation in these centers and increasing injury
*  rates in these centers for the human beings who are still there i mean is part of that just that
*  we're in a transitional time and we haven't yet figured out or the bosses haven't yet figured out
*  that it's important to keep your employees healthy and so let them vary their routines or vary their
*  tasks or something or is it just we're going to dispose of these human beings eventually so who
*  cares i mean i think that amazon has been in such high growth mode for so long that the people in
*  charge whether it was a conscious decision or not have been like okay if we're gonna make this
*  business big and profitable this is the pace of work that we need to set and i think the challenge
*  that amazon has now is they're bigger they're more mature there's more scrutiny but just as importantly
*  the labor market is starting to do its job economics is working in that there are so many
*  fulfillment centers amazon has such a high demand for workers everyone does now because there's a
*  labor shortage especially for blue collar workers that you know raising wages is no longer enough
*  if you have 100 turnover per year which is you know not at all atypical for these warehouses
*  you need to figure out how to hold on to those workers longer and when every time your workers
*  organize they're telling you our issue is not benefits and wages those are fine thank you jeff
*  bezos our issue is working conditions at some point they have to listen otherwise they just
*  cannot run their business because they just can't recruit and retain they can't recruit workers
*  fast enough and they can't retain them long enough because there's only so many human beings
*  of working age in an economy that's just the way it works well a big part of it we should talk about
*  the concept of de-skilling labor i don't know if this goes back to taylor or whoever but the idea
*  that we want to take the trickiest parts of the manufacturing process and give those to the robots
*  to the computers and whatever as much as we can the loom makes it much easier for weaving to be
*  done by unskilled labors and so you figure well now i can just replace my workers with anyone if
*  the parts that they have to do are very simple but they're still like you say a bottleneck with
*  the number of people that exist yeah i mean de-skilling has been integral to the expansion
*  of amazon and countless other businesses right our whole fast food industry is built on this idea
*  that you don't need a skilled fry cook to make a burger because it's automated grill is doing it
*  for you so de-skilling is just when you take the knowledge essentially it's when you take the
*  knowledge of the human you embody it in a machine a piece of automation it doesn't have to be a very
*  smart piece of automation but it is skilled in the sense that it can do a job that before might
*  have been tricky i like that you mentioned looms because that goes all the way back to the luddites
*  and ned ludd wanting to smash the automatic looms because they were taking away the jobs of the
*  weavers but when you de-skill a task you make it very easy to recruit new workers which gives you
*  less incentive to retain them right so if amazon can train a new amazon warehouse worker in a day
*  or less then you know turnover doesn't become a problem until they run out of new people to recruit
*  and i want to you know we skipped over from sort of um frederick wincelow taylor to jeff bezos but
*  in between there's this whole kind of fascinating culture of management scientific management
*  strategies right the toyota way kaizen lean manufacturing and how much of these are like
*  really insightful ways to get manufacturing done and how many of them are sort of management fans
*  yeah uh it's difficult to say because so much depends on how they're applied i mean obviously
*  when um toyota came up with their uh you know uh toyota production system that is the reason that
*  toyota took over the global and especially the u.s. uh auto market um by the same token you know
*  jack welch at g.e came up with this whole idea of six sigma which just means like statistically
*  like reducing the error in your manufacturing process until it's like not even there anymore
*  um and you know all of a lot of that or maybe all of it really derived from yeah this early
*  kind of ideology of um management consulting because you know even though taylor you know
*  he wrote this book scientific management he wasn't so successful as an individual
*  at getting companies to adopt this but his acolytes right um which included like the gilbriths who
*  then had a dozen kids and then there's a dizzy movie called cheaper by the dozen because they
*  were applying the lessons of scientific management to managing a household um really spread this idea
*  around so so it is this idea that just kind of gets expanded on um because in some sense you know
*  if you're especially manufacturing if you adhere to these dictates and these strategies you can
*  make an almost defect free product consistently right which is the goal of manufacturing rather
*  than having to kind of rework it at the end like you know tesla in the early days um so it does
*  work and it does get implemented differently all over the world so the Toyota production system
*  obviously Japan is a completely different cultural milieu than the U.S. because at the time the Toyota
*  production system is being ramped up you know it's a culture of um you know lifelong employment
*  it's this deep relationship between the employee and the employer so there it was more about like
*  empower the worker like if the worker sees something wrong they get to pull their little
*  and on flag and say like hey something's messed up here that exact sort of idea set of ideas
*  got imported into um amazon by some executives who i talked to in the book um you know but it got
*  mutated in some ways and then became the bismism as they took out the worker empowerment part and
*  just put more surveillance in what do best buy wayfair marco polo and among us have in common

*  well and it's not just the need for speed here although that's very important but also the need
*  for predictability like you said before uh we want everything we don't just want the average time
*  to do something to be low but it better not have that much variability around it and and part of
*  that optimization problem has helped us create this culture of just-in-time manufacturing right
*  where you manufacture something and then basically ship it to a person rather than
*  letting it sit in a warehouse for a long time and again that's great for efficiency and
*  productivity a little worrisome when it comes to vulnerable points in the chain right i mean it's
*  it's it's pretty straightforward if you don't have um any extra inventory sitting around
*  and there is a supply shock where you can't get enough of something or suddenly it takes you twice
*  as long to get it across the ocean on a ship then you know you're screwed you're gonna run out
*  okay and then the final step um we were we've gotten our raw materials we've shipped them
*  around the world we've made a product we've shipped it in a container we sent it to a
*  fulfillment center and now they're sending it out so there's a whole nother step of getting the goods
*  to people i mean and maybe we skipped over the the trucking step where we get things from the
*  port to the fulfillment center but but both that trucking step and then the delivery step
*  it's just a whole nother invisible culture of human beings in the united states that
*  you don't paint a very rosy picture of the life of a delivery person or a trucker i gotta say
*  yeah um yeah i mean truckers really i mean they um i think what sums it up there's this
*  amazing 2017 feature in the new york times and you know one of the truckers that whom they interviewed
*  said you know we feel like throwaway people and um you know it's an industry where we often hear
*  about oh there's a trucker shortage but the truth is there's not a shortage of people who want to
*  get into trucking there is a a burnout and a retention crisis there are three times as many
*  people in the united states who have the kind of commercial drivers license required to drive a
*  truck as there are of working truck drivers and it's not because they all retired and are having
*  a nice life and like the lake of the osiris now it's because they burned out or they didn't even
*  last two weeks and were like this job sucks i'm getting out of here and you know frankly i don't
*  think truckers get very good representation in um you know in congress because this big lobbying
*  body there it's called the american trucking association it represents these really big carriers
*  but they don't even represent the majority of the trucking industry most of the trucking industry
*  is like individual owner operators small trucking companies they have their own lobbying body that
*  somehow doesn't get quoted very often so you know truckers you know they are here's the typical
*  life of a trucker right they're on the road 21 days out of every month that means they're nowhere
*  near home or their family they're working 14 hours a day 14 hours a day is because the federal
*  government limits them to 14 hours a day used to be more they're getting paid by the mile so if
*  they're sitting at a warehouse where they have no control over how fast their truck is being loaded
*  or unloaded they're not getting paid for that time um there may not be a place for them to sleep at
*  night because there's not enough births at truck stops and rest stops so they might have to illegally
*  park down the side of the highway you see this once you know that this is a thing you see it all
*  the time you're like why is that truck just parked on the on ramp or the off ramp it's
*  because that poor truck driver couldn't find anywhere else to sleep and also by the way i think
*  because maybe many people don't know this when you say find a place to sleep you're not talking
*  about a hotel they sleep in the truck it's just a matter of where to park the truck while you're
*  sleeping yes um so and and on top of that i mean i think there's this impression like oh drive a
*  truck i can drive like i can do that no like it is a skilled job to not kill yourself and other
*  people because the physics of a fully loaded truck mean that it's going to take you you know
*  a football field or two to stop um and uh you know you may be driving in inclement weather
*  and the whole time you're trying to rush rush rush because you're trying to get to that next
*  destination in time or before your federally regulated time on the road runs out meanwhile
*  you know you and your um boss and or your kind of freight uh company like ch robinson is trying
*  to find you your next load to pick up along the way because you're kind of just like most of these
*  truckers are kind of just like freelancers and they're just like bouncing from point to point
*  um you know and that's the life of like an independent trucker if you are a trucker driving
*  for one of these big carriers and you're new to the industry it's really like indentured service
*  you may owe them for the um training that you got to become a truck driver and you know so you've
*  got like at least a year contract with them that you can't get out of and you know you're working
*  like 80 hours a week and you're making 45 000 a year yeah and you never see your family well one
*  thing that uh one impact that your book has had on my life is that i'm going to definitely
*  think more carefully about changing lanes in front of a truck on the on the highway because
*  you know clearly like you say the physics of it is complex and and i get the impression that
*  truckers are constantly being annoyed because they try to leave some space in between their truck and
*  the car in front of them so it's just a begging for people to like cut in front of them but that's
*  very very dangerous apparently it is it's it's the worst thing never never cut in front of a truck
*  like don't pass a truck until they're at least like you know a couple hundred feet behind you
*  is what i would say and when you talk about like the number of hours that they're uh working per
*  day and that's that's regulated by the government and they can't cheat right because they're being
*  monitored it's in this surveillance state this michelle foucault kind of thing where we're keeping
*  track with gps or whatever of exactly how long they're on the road every day yeah the same
*  management the same you know intensive monitoring by technology and management by algorithm that you
*  find in you know amazon's warehouses you find a different form of it for truck drivers so yeah
*  there's gps there's like you know this little computer that um you know is tracking their time
*  and look i mean it got put in place for reasons that are good which is that people are like well
*  we don't want truckers driving too long that's unsafe fine perfect good but the problem is
*  because truck drivers were used to the old system where they could kind of fudge their records
*  you know maybe they get to a warehouse and somebody's being slow about loading their truck
*  they're gonna hop in the back and take a nap well now that nap still counts as their work day so
*  they're under the same pressure to get loads from point a to point b just as quickly but in a way
*  they have less flexibility about how they do it it's not yeah like i said it's a it's a sort of
*  dispiriting kind of picture of of our world and the fact that about that you raised about the
*  representation in congress is an important one because part of the sort of standard solution to
*  some of these problems is you know yeah there's the ruthless efficiency of capitalism that is
*  going to squeeze everything you can out of these workers and then that's supposed to be ameliorated
*  by the government setting some standards is there hope whether it's in the amazon fulfillment center
*  in the trucking industry for more humane working conditions being enforced by law
*  well in the amazon warehouse california just passed a bill that limits the quota systems that
*  amazon uses in its fulfillment centers and amazon can't just pull out of california so
*  that's gonna have a significant effect there as for truckers the only provision that i'm aware of
*  that's in the infrastructure bill which may not pass anyway came from the american trucking
*  association and get this it is a request that they lower the age at which you can get a commercial
*  driver's license from 21 to 18 so the ata is just like hey get us more cannon fodder also teenagers
*  with their teenage brains are going to be driving these you know enormous trucks on our roads so yeah
*  i i that industry seems very fragmented very dysfunctional when you talk to people who really
*  understand it deeply they're like they shake their heads and they're like what are we going to do
*  and in the meantime you know i am genuinely concerned that it will lead to you know problems
*  in the supply chain that will affect us all because it's true you know by value of goods it's like 90
*  percent 90 plus percent of the value of goods that moves through america it does it moves on trucks
*  you know like that old phrase like if trucks stop america stops it's true if you can't get it at
*  your grocery store it's probably because they couldn't find the trucker to deliver it and
*  there is this closely related uh part of the system which is the individual deliveries i don't
*  even know what the what terminology we use here but the you the last mile the last mile ups fedex
*  and all that ups fedex and also as you mentioned companies like amazon might just be building
*  their own networks to do this and you paint a very vivid picture of once again how much pressure
*  there is on these drivers to be efficient to move quickly and to get it done yeah i mean there's
*  there's tremendous pressure and there's a lot of variability in that industry in terms of how
*  drivers are treated if you look at a company like ups you know the company is more than 100 years
*  old it's unionized it's a real no joke union it's the teamsters um you know it is it is what
*  academics call uh like business unionism where it's not like the two are locked in a in battle
*  all the time like the union makes concessions so that the business can continue to run and be
*  profitable and everybody can have a job still but it means that you know ups is pretty um
*  conscientious about training their drivers to be safe about you know helping them if they get into
*  trouble with like too many packages and such and then kind of on the other end of the spectrum you
*  have fedex is all um subcontracted delivery companies so none of their drivers are unionized
*  and then amazon just copied fedex's model to build their own last mile delivery network so when you
*  see those big like you know gray vans with the amazon logo on the side that is a local company
*  it's like a franchisee almost a local company that um contracts with amazon and then on the
*  other end hired a bunch of drivers you know amazon has recognized that the pressure to deliver
*  so many packages so quickly you know has affected potentially the safety of those drivers
*  um so their response typical amazon was let's put more surveillance on the truck like let's
*  put more cameras facing out and facing in so we can watch them be unsafe the funny thing when you
*  talk to amazon about this whenever you ask them like have you ever just considered likes lowering
*  the pace of work they're like nah that could just be bad messaging on their part like i think that
*  in warehouses they probably are doing that lowering the pace of work sometimes because
*  they can just it's just a little toggle on some engineers dashboard somewhere like yeah fewer
*  widgets um but um you know it's a lot of growing pains because it's it's a company where um i don't
*  know if i would call it growth at all costs but it's just a very aggressive environment where it's
*  like everybody should perform at the highest level all the time and if you can't do it like we're
*  just going to cut you from the team um you know and and and maybe that works when you're kind of
*  the upstart and you're challenging the world's retail giants and e-commerce is a small fraction
*  of all of retail but like now that it is such a big proportion of it and they got a you know it's
*  it's like we all kind of live and work in the company store like the united states of amazon
*  you know the the way that people are employed has to be changed i mean i totally get the critique
*  but if i'm honest i love amazon i use it all the time and you know i don't i try to spread out
*  my e-commerce and you know buy from independent bookstores and things like that as well but it's
*  just so convenient oh my goodness how can you help but buy from amazon well i mean matthew
*  glazius the the former founder of vox and political commentator he said something which is funny but
*  i think true he's like sometimes i wish that um a company like amazon would become so dominant
*  because then it would be easier to regulate this very fragmented industry of supply chains and it's
*  like a fair point you know because like trucking is super fragmented and like that hasn't helped
*  those truck drivers at all like if amazon had to own its entire trucking industry like if you have
*  a sane democracy like it could make you know setting out fair rules easier and more possible
*  and again when i talk to amazon workers which i have with some frequency they're they're not
*  asking people to boycott the company like the nabisco workers who are like don't buy you know
*  frosted mini wheats or whatever um they're just like we want to highlight what's going on
*  because you know we want working conditions to improve so i don't know that it's about amazon
*  is evil and amazon needs to be kicked to the curb i think it's more like amazon represents this new
*  reality which you know frankly is being copied by countless other companies whether it's walmart or
*  target or lows or anybody who's moved into e-commerce and kind of as a society we need
*  to take a hard look at like what this means for workers and the environment and everything else
*  and make decisions inform decisions about how we want to regulate that and when we don't want to
*  regulate it well now that we've discussed how modern manufacturing crushes people's souls let's
*  not neglect the fact that there are also interesting math problems that come up which we like to talk
*  about here on mindscape and you you just very briefly in the book like like mention one fact
*  that i thought was fascinating and worth a whole nother book the difference in the at the sort of
*  level of fedex or whatever between the hub and spoke model where there was a few centers that
*  everyone drove to and everyone drove from versus more of a mesh like as a as a network theory
*  person this is this is fascinating where we're somehow learning on the fly how to optimize this
*  network uh in different ways and i'm wondering how much of that is just trial and error and how much
*  of that is actually mathematicians or or engineers computer scientists thinking about this well if
*  you start to dig into the supply chain literature the amount of mathematics and engineering and
*  computer science in there is really mind-boggling because it's these big meaty problems where if
*  you can make a fraction of a percentage point difference in the efficiency of a port or a
*  delivery network or whatever it is you can save somebody like tens of millions of dollars so
*  the companies in that industry invest unreal amounts in in in the engineering and the mathematics
*  i mean ups spent 300 million dollars this was like 20 years ago 300 million dollars just to stand up
*  their orion software which you know dictates like the roots of ups drivers every day to make their
*  delivery network as efficient as possible i mean who knows how much they've spent since then
*  updating it probably you know a comparable amount and that's just ups like ups is not known to people
*  as like a technology company or anything i mean if you just imagine how much rnd amazon spends
*  to optimize its own warehouses in its own um network like yeah there's there's so much
*  mathematics and it's and it's and it's all of these you know p versus mp like you could not
*  solve this problem the traveling sales problem yeah computer until the yeah it's like you're
*  not going to solve this problem before the heat death of the universe so how do we approximate a
*  good enough answer um so so it is it's definitely an industry where um that kind of math uh just
*  makes such a big difference that there's that there's so much thinking about it and so many
*  new models and the application of new tools you know like um you know i i often think that ai is
*  really oversold but that the most boring applications of machine learning are often the best
*  yeah um and you know predictive analytics it's like it was just born to try to predict demand
*  and predict seasonal fluctuations in demand and you know heat map where things need to go
*  in the most optimal way like it's this is a great application for it and you spoke before about um
*  so you i mean you just mentioned the the ai the automation part of things let's sort of uh wind
*  things up with this a view of the future and i think there's two big questions here one is what
*  is the role of increased automation it's not going away we're not decreasing the amount of automation
*  right and then is there some sense in which uh any of these innovations can actually help
*  workers can give them a bit more agency or is it all just a downhill spiral from here on in
*  yeah i mean i think what we're seeing in the kind of the nature of work in general is this kind of
*  polarization where like yes the american middle class is getting hollowed out and yes a lot of
*  people have been pushed down the scale of income into jobs that are more managed by algorithm
*  but also you know many many people have been pushed up that income scale and are doing jobs
*  that no machine can do right like sometimes people talk about how do you want to future
*  proof yourself like well like figure out how to solve problems and be creative and get an
*  education because these are the things that automation can't do for us so i think this sort
*  of the real kind of challenge of our time is how do we make sure that as we incorporate more and
*  more automation into our economy which does make it more productive right which can make life better
*  for everybody in theory it certainly produces more wealth you know this is the obviously the
*  sort of big political issue of our time but i think at a fundamental level it's it all it comes down
*  to like for a lot of people like just the dignity of work and how much opportunity they have
*  to make a living wage and have a permanent or a stable job or not um and so i do think that as we
*  incorporate more and more automation there is an opportunity to do it in a humane way and there are
*  examples of this in other countries in the us at other points in history where automation has
*  increased productivity but people have enough agency and enough security in their jobs that it
*  is a net benefit for them um but you know obviously we kind of haven't been heading in that direction
*  for most of the last let's say since the 70s i do take solace in the fact that like we are
*  experiencing now the so-called great resignation and people are kind of seem to be revaluating
*  their lives and have you know some savings and what else so that they can um make these job
*  changes um i do think it's kind of forcing a reckoning uh and i am hopeful that it will
*  then force a lot of companies and a lot of engineers to look at the on the ground impact
*  of the automation they've created and um make it more humane and my final thought on that is
*  i actually know somebody who turns out is the type of like process engineer who does this kind of
*  stuff on a consulting basis and she told me you know i've worked on these warehouse systems before
*  i had i'm so glad that i read this part of your book because i'd never thought about it from the
*  perspective of the worker this person is not a psychopath or an unkind person it's just
*  they're thinking about it in terms of my job is to optimize this system but you know we have to
*  take this more holistic view and maybe to just get on the table the most obvious thing that you
*  didn't even bother to say but there's this very old idea which has always thus far been wrong
*  that if you decrease the number of hours it takes to perform a task people will do less work because
*  they don't need to do as much work to get the same stuff done and you know people a hundred years
*  ago were imagining that by now we would have three hour work days and three day work weeks
*  but the work always expands to fill the space in some sense right because our demands always expand
*  so yeah i mean if we all were content with you know leading the live that our ancestors had
*  you know in the 1950s given the increase in productivity since then like yeah we could
*  all work like three days a week but we wouldn't have like you know kidney dialysis machines or
*  mrna vaccines or the internet or anything else so we just keep making our material culture
*  more complicated and the energy and complexity embodied in you know our consumer gadgets for
*  example represents all the extra labor that has to be performed in order to maintain our modern
*  standard of living and there there seems to be no end to that so yeah machines don't take away jobs
*  but they can change the nature of those jobs for good or for ill and i think understanding that
*  process and being aware of it gives us the opportunity to kind of bend the arc of history
*  toward making work more humane and more dignified you mentioned creative jobs and i always you
*  didn't say this but let's just air the idea i do think that there's in some circles a kind of utopian
*  idea that maybe someday we'll all be writers and poets but once all the menial tasks have been
*  taken up by robots and computers and i think that that's a very almost elitist kind of attitude like
*  i think that there are people who just don't want to be writers and poets or you know they on the one
*  hand like to work on the other hand they're happy to do something that is sort of solid
*  predictable work because it's not their lives like they get the meaning out of their lives
*  somewhere else they just want to go to work do a good job and be safe like they don't want to work
*  in terrible conditions but they're but they're not you know rebelling against the fact that
*  they don't you know produce great works of art and and you had again one little sentence in the
*  book it's a very rich book in terms of individual threads you could pull out where amazon had a
*  program where it would let its workers train to be higher skilled laborers and number one
*  the the workers are like i don't have time for this you're working me too hard but number two
*  the kinds of jobs they thought of training for were basically to be a truck driver it wasn't to
*  be a coder or or a manager right and and yeah the most popular certificate was the truck drivers
*  license and so i don't know maybe you mentioned the great resignation you know maybe we are on
*  the cusp of a transition where some people won't have to work at all i did a podcast episode with
*  john denner who really just sort of intentionally pushed the most utopian automation is going to
*  free us from drudgery kind of point of view but you need on the same hand to have some
*  basic income or something like that and maybe the stimulus checks were the first step in that
*  direction i mean so anyway i've just plowed a bunch of things do you have some big picture
*  visualization of how the future of all this is going to shake out let's say 50 years from now
*  i mean i can't predict how it's going to shake out because there's so many contingencies that
*  i can't anticipate the impact of like you know extreme weather and accelerating climate change
*  and stuff but but i do think i do think you know that we kind of have the opportunity to
*  um yeah i mean work shouldn't be exploitative it shouldn't be unsustainable physically like these
*  are basic um i mean it occurs to me in this moment that maybe we should consider them rights like a
*  humane work environment should be a right we certainly have the resources the productivity
*  in our economy to accomplish that um and you know we used to have stronger labor protections which
*  sort of treated this as a right um i think if we move in that direction yeah like look this whole
*  idea that we're going to get fully automated luxury communism or whatever you want to call it
*  and everybody's just gonna um be a poet like i got news for you like half the people are just
*  gonna sit around like smoking weed all day and be very unhappy like you know doing stuff the the
*  dignity of work um is extremely important people need to feel empowered by like i did this thing
*  and then here's the result like that is that's that's instinctual for most of us i think
*  so um yeah this idea that we're just going to end work seems silly to me well and and it also just
*  completely misreads what automation does to economies and i think that no matter where
*  people are on the political spectrum everybody gets this wrong it's so aggravating to me it's
*  like i want to write a whole book about just this and other myths about technology and its effects
*  on society and just be and just shake people and be like look listen what technology does is it
*  changes the nature of work and we need to be aware of the way it changes the nature of work so that
*  we can continue to maintain like humane dignified work and yeah not everybody has to like derive
*  their life's meaning from work and frankly more of us should stop trying to derive you know our
*  life's meaning from our work i think that's the other thing that the great resignation is about
*  is like is people pulling back and being like yeah i'm in a creative profession but it doesn't define
*  me like i'm not my job like oh maybe i should go connect with my community maybe i should spend
*  more time with my family like maybe i should have a hobby for the first time in my life but so i
*  want to i want to complicate that i like everything you just said we're going to complicate it just a
*  little bit in two ways one way is i absolutely believe that there are plenty of people out there
*  who derive dignity from work even if it's not creative and fulfilling in and of itself that
*  the very act of doing work and contributing something and occupying that part of your day
*  is useful and we need to have an economy that lets people do that in a meaningful and well
*  compensated way on the other hand there will be some people who want to sit around and smoke weed
*  or sit around and play video games and actually are happy because of that right i mean and maybe
*  that should be okay like maybe we can change society and you know like i say usually once
*  we're past the one hour mark in the podcast we can just say any crazy thing we want can we change
*  instead of saying that you know automation and productivity gets rid of jobs and work i mean
*  maybe it gets to the point where it allows us to imagine changing society so much that work becomes
*  less of the the linchpin of our lives i do like that idea and i do think we need to do that
*  because i think that if you i mean i have my undergraduate degree is actually in anthropology
*  and you know one of my professor's favorite things to tell us about was that you know hunter gather
*  societies are the original affluent society like the number of hours it takes you know a kung-san
*  tribesperson to to gather enough calories for the day and and do their chores or whatever is like
*  four and the rest of the time they're going to sit around like you know chewing the fat with their
*  neighbors i mean look we have had you go read the book bowling alone like we've had this real kind
*  of tragedy this death of civil society at the end of the day i think because people are just too
*  busy so yeah like if we can take some of this wealth and this productivity we've created
*  and figure out how to distribute that you know whether it's through higher wages or
*  you know other government subsidies or whatever your political orientation leads you to want to
*  favor then yes i think we should aspire to return to a world where everyone doesn't have to work as
*  hard because we will have a healthier world we'll have a healthier planet we'll hopefully reverse
*  the trend of more and more people reporting that they're anxious and depressed every year i mean i
*  do think that we have the industrialization of our economy and Taylorism and the spread of all of this
*  has created a you know a cultish ideology that everybody should just work work work work more
*  and the highest value is you know xyz measure of success and you know we i don't think anybody
*  actually most people actually really don't want that so whatever we can build to get us there
*  whether it's you know universal basic income or however people want to attempt to get there or you
*  know my favorite thing is like we really should change our labor laws to allow to make it easier
*  for workers to unionize again because i tell you what that's how we got the 40-hour work week
*  that's a really fast way to get wages to go up so that people don't have to work as hard
*  whatever your preferred solution like yeah we should do that everybody should be working less
*  i like it that's a perfect place to end up so Christopher Mims thanks so much for being on the
*  Mindscape podcast Sean this is genuinely a pleasure i you have had the best questions of
*  anybody so far all right don't do any more this is it let's let's go out on the top
